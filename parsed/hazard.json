  "text": " Banshee's Symphony Source Core Rulebook pg. 529 4.0 Complexity Complex A magically contagious wail of the banshee spell is trapped in the larynx of an invisible, mummified elf. --- Stealth +30 (legendary) Disable Thievery DC 42 (master) to pierce the invisible larynx so precisely that the magic releases in a trickle before the trap activates, Thievery DC 44 (legendary) three times to deconstruct the larynx while the trap is active in such a way that it tears the spell apart, or spell DC 38 (9th level) to counteract the wail of the banshee before the trap activates Scream Reaction Trigger Three or more living creatures remain within 100 feet of the trap for 6 seconds or longer. Effect The trap releases an arcane wail of the banshee (DC 40) with a 100-foot-radius emanation instead of 40 feet, targeting all living creatures in the area, and rolls initiative. --- Routine (1 action) The trap uses its action to force one random creature that failed its save against wail of the banshee last turn to emit a wail of the banshee with the same statistics as the initial one. The creature wails even if it is dead or unable to speak, no matter how far away from the trap it is. Unlike a casting of the spell, the drained condition from this trap’s wail of the banshee spells increases the targets’ drained condition values. A creature that critically succeeds at any of its saves can still be affected by the trap on future rounds, but can’t be forced to wail by the trap. --- Reset The trap ends when the trap is unable to make a creature scream (usually because no creature failed its save on the previous turn or because all creatures have critically succeeded in the past). It then resets over 24 hours, as a new scream builds up in the mummified larynx.",

A keg that is removed from its position (either by being thrown over the cliff or merely carried away) retains its explosive potential, but as long as one of the three kegs are removed they no longer have the precise placement required to trigger a collapse—an explosion at this point merely inflicts fire damage in the appropriate areas but does not particularly damage the temple structure itself. A keg's contents can be dispersed by scattering the gunpowder to the wind (most efficiently by pouring it over the cliff side) as a 2-action activity, or rendered permanently inert by pouring a gallon of water into the powder, inhibiting its explosive qualities. The kegs themselves can be destroyed with damage (note that the AC listed below for each keg takes into account the fact that Gerhard has wedged the kegs into nooks in the temple's stone flooring and walls), but note that any fire damage (including incidental fire damage from area effects like a fireball or Gerhard's blunderbuss) causes them to explode. At your option, other actions may be similarly effective at disabling this hazard. AC 26, Fort +17, Ref +8 Hidden Keg Hardness 5 Hidden Keg HP 20 (BT 10) Immunities critical hits, object immunities, precision damage Weaknesses fire automatically penetrates hardness Destructive Explosion Reaction (fire); Trigger One of the three kegs takes any fire damage, including damage caused by a line of black powder burning up to a keg. Effect The keg explodes, causing 5d6 fire damage (DC 24 basic Reflex) in a 20-foot emanation; this can cause an instantaneous chain reaction if either of the other kegs are in this area (note that as positioned, all three kegs are in range to trigger a chain reaction). Fire damage in overlapping areas isn't cumulative, but if all three kegs are in their initial positions when the explosion occurs, the temple itself collapses, causing 8d6 bludgeoning damage to all creatures in the temple (DC 24 basic Reflex).",

The water churns through the room and flows out through three chutes on the south end of the room. --- Stealth +17 (expert) or Perception DC 27 (expert) to notice the six cleverly hidden sluice gates while they are closed Disable Thievery DC 28 (expert) twice to close a sluice (on a critical success, a sluice is closed immediately) Sluiceway Hardness 17 Sluiceway HP 38 (BT 34) Immunities critical hits, object immunities, precision damage Opened Sluices Reaction Trigger A creature Interacts to throw either the primary lever or backup lever. Effect The trap rolls initiative. --- Routine (6 actions) The trap loses 1 action per disabled or destroyed sluice. On each of its actions, the water rushing from the sluices flows through the room, creating a river of churning water that fills the room to several inches and makes the floor of the chamber into difficult terrain. The water level never rises above this level in the room, as it drains out of the chutes to the south and begins to flood the quarry pit (area J2). On the trap's second turn, the water starts filling the four slave pits in area J2. Each of the trap's actions fills the pits 4 inches (2 feet per round if all sluices are functional). If the slave pits fill to their total depth of 12 feet and the grates over the slave pits aren't open, the slaves begin to drown, dying if they aren't freed in 5 rounds. Once the slave pits are full, the water continues to slowly fill the central area over the course of an hour until it empties the reservoir and floods area J2 to a depth of 15 feet. Other options beyond disabling or destroying the sluices could prevent the flooding of the quarry pit at your discretion. --- Reset The trap resets if all six sluices are closed. If all the water has drained when this occurs, the water takes many months to refill.",

Each creature in area D5 must attempt a DC 21 Will save. The haunt then rolls initiative. Critical Success The creature sees through the illusion entirely and is temporarily immune to the haunt's routine for 1 minute. Success The creature is not tempted by the food. Failure The creature believes the food is appetizing and becomes driven to consume it. The creature takes 4d4+4 slashing damage as it chews the jagged bones and husks. Critical Failure As failure, but the creature takes double damage and is paralyzed for 1 round as the haunt continues to tempt it. --- Routine (1 action) The haunt sends a cloud of dust and bone shards hurtling about the room. The dust and bones batter all creatures in the room, dealing 4d6 bludgeoning damage (DC 21 basic Reflex save). Creatures who fail the save are blinded for 1 round (or 1 minute on a critical failure). --- Reset The haunt re-forms after 1 hour. The haunt becomes disabled and doesn't re-form if a creature eats a full meal at the desk—this can be any food, not just the “food” at hand.",

Originally, agents of the abbot would come through here after the trap was triggered, deactivate it, and clean out the hardened blobs of lava and dead bodies that remained, but the amount of time it would take for this trap to clog tunnels with cooled lava makes tracking that slow accretion over the course of this adventure unnecessary. Ranged Single Action lava gout +17 (fire), Damage 4d8 fire; no multiple attack penalty --- Reset The Last Crucible deactivates and resets 10 minutes after it has no target creatures (because the creatures either left area H4 or died). Any thoqquas that still live sense the magma river at area H6 and eventually make their way north to that area to swim away.",

Each creature must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or become enfeebled 1 (enfeebled 2 on a critical failure). --- Routine (4 actions) The trap loses 1 action per disabled face each turn. On each action, a different face spews a writhing breath of darkness from its mouth to a target in area C2. A creature can only be targeted once per round by the despairing breath, so if fewer than four creatures are in the room, the trap won't be able to take full advantage of all four of its actions.

A creature damaged by the despairing breath must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or become frightened 1 (or fleeing 1 on a critical failure); this effect has the fear trait. --- Reset The trap resets after 1 minute.",

The GM determines whether or not a check counts toward this goal (at the very least, all combat checks made against foes in the rest of the adventure count). Success The creature is unaffected. Failure Feelings of sadness and despair well up in the creature's mind. For the next hour, the creature takes a –1 penalty to all saving throws against mental effects; this penalty increases to a –2 penalty against emotion mental effects. This effect has the curse trait. Critical Failure As failure, but the effects persist as long as the green hag Tulvak remains in control of the shrine.",

A creature within 10 feet of one end of the bridge can attempt a DC 18 Reflex saving throw to Grab a Ledge along the side of either A8 or A13. If one side of the bridge has been disabled by resecuring the ropes, a character on any section of the bridge can attempt a DC 18 Reflex save to hang onto the bridge as one side of it falls. The dangling bridge thereafter functions as a ladder connecting either area A8 or A13 (whichever was secured) to the forest floor.",

The triggering creature takes 4d10+10 piercing damage and 2d6 persistent bleed damage (DC 26 basic Reflex save; if the creature critically succeeds, they avoid the trap completely). The triggering creature is also immobilized. The victim can end their immobilization only once a creature outside the iron maiden unlocks the device (requiring two successful DC 28 Thievery checks to Disable a Device) or breaks the iron maiden, after which the trapped creature must succeed at a DC 25 check to Escape the trap's spike-lined interior. --- Reset The pressure plate must be reset manually.",
