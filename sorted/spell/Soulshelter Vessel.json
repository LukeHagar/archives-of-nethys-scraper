You create a pool of healing within the object, which starts out with 40 HP worth of healing per Bulk of the object. (These HP can only be used by the creature, and don't increase the object's HP.) When you Cast the Spell, the targeted creature regains 10 HP, which come out of the object's pool. You can also spend a single action—which has the [concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32), [good](/Traits.aspx?ID=83), [healing](/Traits.aspx?ID=89), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117), and [positive](/Traits.aspx?ID=128) traits—to repeat this transfer. When the pool is empty, the object becomes [broken](/Conditions.aspx?ID=2). The spell ends if the object becomes broken or the targets are no longer within 500 feet of each other.\n\n If the target creature would be reduced to 0 Hit Points, the creature regains either 20 HP or the amount left in the object's pool, whichever is lower.
