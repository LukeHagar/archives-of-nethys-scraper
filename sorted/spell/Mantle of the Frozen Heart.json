Freezing air emanates from your body, sending a chill down anyone's spine who draws too close and leaving a fine dusting of frost in your wake. Upon Casting this Spell, pick two of the options below.

You don't need to [Balance](/Actions.aspx?ID=28) on ice, and you ignore difficult terrain caused by ice or snow. While moving along a smooth surface, you gain a +20-foot status bonus to your land Speed.\r\n- **Icy Claws** Your hands morph into vicious, piercing claws of ice useful for attacking or climbing. As long as you have both hands free, you gain a climb Speed equal to your land Speed. You gain a claw [unarmed](/Traits.aspx?ID=199) attack with the [agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170) and [finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179) traits, in the [brawling](/WeaponGroups.aspx?ID=4) weapon group.
