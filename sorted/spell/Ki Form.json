In your ki form, your hair, feathers, skin, or scales change color and begin to glow. In this form you gain a fly Speed equal to your land Speed.

Your entire body is also surrounded by a glowing corona of the same color as your inner ki; this is a [light](/Traits.aspx?ID=100) effect. Your corona is a 5-foot emanation that deals 2d6 damage of the chosen type to creatures who start their turn within the emanation. If the emanation overlaps with a [darkness](/Traits.aspx?ID=39) effect, the corona's glow attempts to [counteract](/Rules.aspx?ID=371) the darkness effect. Regardless of the outcome, the corona can't attempt to counteract that effect again for 1 day. As a single action, which has the [concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32) trait, you can flare your corona out to become a 30-foot emanation.\n\n In your ki form, your emotions surge to the forefront and it's difficult to moderate your attacks. Your weapons and unarmed attacks lose the [nonlethal](/Traits.aspx?ID=188) trait.
