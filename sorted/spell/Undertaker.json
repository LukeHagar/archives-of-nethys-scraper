This spell works best when both you and the target are in contact with solid ground.

If the target is in contact with solid ground, the ground in the target's space churns and cracks open into an open but shallow grave.

If the target is in contact with solid ground, a grave opens beneath their feet and they fall prone within. The grave then forms a stone sarcophagus-like shell around the victim. This stone shell cannot be opened and must be broken; it has AC 10, Hardness 14, and 80 Hit Points. At the start of your next turn, the grave fills in with soil. If the victim dies while inside this grave, at the next sundown the victim transforms into an evil [ghast](/Monsters.aspx?ID=219) as the sarcophagus crumbles, allowing the new undead to dig its way up to the surface.",
