The target must attempt a Will save. Critical Success You can make neither heads nor tails of the target's timeline, and the target is unaffected. Success The target must commit to a single action that it will take at some point during its next turn: “Stride toward Valeros,” “Cast shield ,” “Strike at Amiri with my jaws.” That action is now locked in, and the creature must attempt it, even if the situation has changed—if the creature stated that it would Strike at Amiri with its jaws, it must try to do so.

If the situation changes oddly (perhaps the creature is forcibly teleported away and has no idea which direction is “toward Valeros” any longer), the GM determines what happens. Failure As success, but the creature must commit at least two of its actions for the next turn—“I will Stride toward Valeros and then Strike with my claws.” All of these actions are similarly locked in and can't be changed, but the creature can take them in any order.
