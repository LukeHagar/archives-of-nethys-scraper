It squeezes itself into its war form from time long forgotten, unleashing its wrath upon your foes. The Fleshforged occupies the space noted in the spell description. When you Cast this Spell, choose one of the Fleshforged below to summon.\n\n- **Bone Breaker** _Size_ Gargantuan, _Speed_ 40 feet, climb 100 feet; **Arrive** _Skull Breaking Hum_ ([evocation](/Equipment.aspx?ID=1671), [sonic](/Traits.aspx?ID=147)) The Bone Breaker appears in a shower of bone fragments. Its form is that of an immense titan of flesh and metal with long, muscular, twisted arms. The Bone Breaker releases a hum at a harmonic frequency that weakens bones in creatures' bodies. Each foe within an 80-foot emanation must attempt a Fortitude save. On a critical success, they're  unaffected; on a success, they're [enfeebled 2](/Conditions.aspx?ID=13) for 1 round; on a failure they're enfeebled 3 for 1 minute; and on a critical failure, they're enfeebled 4 for 10 minutes. A [skeleton](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=92) or other [undead](/Traits.aspx?ID=160) foe made almost entirely of bones treats their result as one degree of success worse than they rolled. **Depart** _Bruising Departure_ The Bone Breaker pounds its long arms into the ground, creating a long shockwave. Each foe within a 100-foot-long, 10-foot-wide line takes 8d12 bludgeoning damage, with a [basic](/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Fortitude save.\r\n- **Thorn Caller** _Size_ Gargantuan, _Speed_ 100 feet; **Arrive** ([evocation](/Traits.aspx?ID=65), [light](/Traits.aspx?ID=100)) _Thorn's Guidance_ The Thorn Caller appears in a burst of light. The Thorn Caller's body is an ornate armored sphere with black panther masks surrounding a glowing light. The ball floats in the air due to six glowing, thornlike wings. Two clusters of bird heads emerge from both sides of the body with long necks that twirl together like tentacles. The Thorn Caller's burst of light illuminates all foes within 200 feet. The foes become [dazzled](/Conditions.aspx?ID=7) and [flat-footed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=16), and if they were [invisible](/Conditions.aspx?ID=26), they become [concealed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=4) instead. These effects last until the Thorn Caller departs. **Depart** _Thorn-Burst_ The Thorn Caller launches its thorned wings at various targets. Attempt spell attack rolls against up to 6 different targets within 300 feet. On a hit, the target takes 10d8 piercing damage, double on a critical hit, half on a failure, and none on a critical failure.\r\n- **The Thousand** _Size_ Medium (see below), _Speed_ 30 feet; **Arrive** ([emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61), [fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=68), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) _Disconcerting Arrival_ Select five spaces in range and summon a Medium-sized polyp of The Thousand in each of these spaces. The Thousand is an entity whose full scope is 1,000 polyps of oozing flesh, each physically separate but mentally part of a single creature. Not all 1,000 polyps have survived, and the spell summons five of them. Each creature within 10 feet of any of the polyps must attempt a Will Save. On a critical success, they're unaffected; on a success, they're [frightened 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=19); on a failure, they're frightened 3; and on a critical failure, they're frightened 4 and [fleeing](/Conditions.aspx?ID=17) for 1 round; **Depart** ([illusion](/Traits.aspx?ID=92), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) _Violent Omen_ Each frightened foe within a 60-foot emanation of any of the five polyps takes 10d8 mental damage, with a [basic](/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Will save.\r\n- **Scion of Desiccation** _Size_ Gargantuan, _Speed_ 100 feet, fly 100 feet; **Arrive** ([necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117), [negative](/Traits.aspx?ID=118)) _Ashes to Ashes_ The Scion of Desiccation appears in a swirl of screaming wind, a gargantuan form of twisted flesh that's constantly flensed by gritty ash and dust, and just as constantly regenerating itself. Each foe within a 40-foot emanation takes 10d10 negative energy damage, with a [basic](/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Fortitude save; **Depart** ([necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117), [negative](/Traits.aspx?ID=118)) _Dust to Dust_ Each foe within a 60-foot emanation must attempt a Fortitude save; they're [drained 2](/Conditions.aspx?ID=10) on a failure or drained 4 on a critical failure.",
