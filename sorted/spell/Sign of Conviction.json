This religious symbol is immobile, made of pure magical force, and can't be damaged. As long as you Sustain _sign of conviction_, you gain a +1 status bonus to AC and saving throws and are [immobilized](/Conditions.aspx?ID=24). The DC for any effect to force you to move out of your space (such as the [Shove](/Actions.aspx?ID=38) action) is equal to your spell DC or the normal DC, whichever is higher. If you stop being immobilized or are moved out of your space, _sign of conviction_ immediately ends.\n\n When you Cast the Spell and each time you Sustain the Spell, the religious symbol emits a blast of energy at a target within 100 feet. Make a spell attack roll that deals 2d10 damage on a success (see below for determining damage type) and double damage on a critical success. You can Sustain the Spell multiple times in the same round to emit an array of blasts.\n\n If you worship a good deity, the spell gains the [good](/Traits.aspx?ID=83) and [light](/Traits.aspx?ID=100) traits, deals your choice of either fire or good damage, and emits bright light in a 20-foot burst. If you worship an evil deity, the spell gains the [evil](/Traits.aspx?ID=64) and [darkness](/Traits.aspx?ID=39) traits, deals your choice of cold or evil damage, and reduces the light level in a 20-foot burst to dim light if it would be brighter. If you worship a neutral deity, the spell gains the [force](/Traits.aspx?ID=75) trait and deals force damage.\n\n---\r\n**Heightened (+2)**  The damage increases by 1d10.",
