Make a ranged spell attack roll against your target's AC. On a success, you deal 3d6 electricity damage. On a critical success, the target takes double damage and is dazzled for 1 round. The number of actions you spend when Casting this Spell determines the range and other parameters. Two Actions (somatic, verbal) This spell has a range of 30 feet. Three Actions (material, somatic, verbal) This spell has a range of 60 feet and deals half damage on a failure (but not a critical failure) as the electricity lashes out and jolts the target. Two Rounds If you spend 3 actions Casting the Spell, you can avoid finishing the spell and spend another 3 actions on your next turn to empower the spell even further. If you do, after attacking the target, whether you hit or miss, the ball of lightning explodes, dealing 2d6 electricity damage to all other creatures in a 10-foot emanation around the target (basic Reflex save).
