Your body warps and morphs into an angelic form, made of [Heaven's](/Planes.aspx?ID=17) light. Upon Casting this Spell, pick two different options below. As a single action, which has the [concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32) trait, you can lose one of the options you chose and select a different one (you don't benefit from having the same option selected twice at the same time).\n\n- **Threshold's Walls** Glimmering barriers form around you.

You gain an arsenal unarmed attack, which has the [reach](/Traits.aspx?ID=192) and [shove](/Traits.aspx?ID=193) traits, in the polearm group. Your arsenal attack deals 1d10 piercing damage as its base damage, plus an additional 1d8 good damage, and counts as [silver](/Equipment.aspx?ID=379).\r\n- **Clarion's Sanctity** Your eyes glow with golden light, seeing that which others prefer remain unseen. You gain a +2 status bonus on checks to [Recall Knowledge](/Actions.aspx?ID=26) and [Sense Motive](/Actions.aspx?ID=85), and when you succeed at a check to Recall Knowledge about a creature you can see, you can attempt to Sense its Motive as a free action.\r\n- **Requius's Rest** Your hands glow with soft white energy that spreads to your wounds. You gain [fast healing 2](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=15).\r\n- **Illumis's Parlance** Your voice echoes like a trumpet. You can be heard clearly up to 200 feet away when you speak, if you choose to project your voice.\r\n- **Iuidica's Verdict** Your body pulses with scarlet light, pushing away those judged to be against you. As a free action triggered by succeeding at a Strike, you can attempt to [Shove](/Actions.aspx?ID=38) the creature you hit.",
