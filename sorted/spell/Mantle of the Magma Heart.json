The air around you swelters with heat, and tiny sparks of flame dance behind you as you pass. Upon casting this spell, pick two of the options below. As a single action, which has the [concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32) trait, you can change one of your chosen abilities to a different option from the list.\n\n- **Enlarging Eruption** You erupt in lava, which clings to you and hardens, causing your body to swell and burst until you grow to size Large. You're [clumsy 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=3). Your reach increases by 5 feet (or by 10 feet if you started out Tiny), and you gain a +2 status bonus to melee damage. You can't choose this option if you're already Large or larger.\r\n- **Fiery Grasp** Your hands swell and grow with lava. You gain a lava fist [unarmed](/Traits.aspx?ID=199) attack in the [brawling](/WeaponGroups.aspx?ID=4) weapon group. Your lava fists deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage as their base damage, plus an additional 2d6 fire damage and 1d6 [persistent fire damage](/Conditions.aspx?ID=29).\r\n- **Heart of Fire** Your body's temperature becomes so hot that any creature that touches you, or that hits you with a melee [unarmed](/Traits.aspx?ID=199) attack or non-[reach](/Traits.aspx?ID=192) melee weapon attack, takes 2d6 fire damage.\r\n- **Warming Flames** Flames flicker around you, warming away the cold while protecting you from the heat. You gain resistance 5 to [cold](/Traits.aspx?ID=27) and [fire](/Traits.aspx?ID=72).",
