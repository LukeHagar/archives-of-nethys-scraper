  "text": " Godless Graycloak Source Agents of Edgewatch Player's Guide pg. 6 You were a member of a church once, and you saw some things among Absalom's religious elite that put you off piety for good. Maybe it was one too many beggars turned away at the temple's front door, or maybe it was a high-ranking priests consistent abuses of power. What got to you most, though, was that according to just about every belief system out there, sinners and saints, priests and paupers were all alike in one key way: they never saw retribution or accolades until buried 6 feet under. You wanted more from Absalom. You wanted more from the world. You wanted justice now, on this plane, not in some indeterminate afterlife. So you left the church and wandered the city, a ghost of your former self. You finally found a like mind in Captain Runewulf, \"the Unbeliever\", whose reputation and similar distaste for religion inspired you to join the Graycloaks. As a sworn protector of the Ascendant Court, you didn't differentiate between Sarenites or Pharasmins, Iomedaeans or Norgorberites; if you saw someone in danger, you put your life on the line to save them, whatever their place within or outside a church. Your good record has earned you a transfer-temporary or not, the choice is yours-to the newly formed Edgewatch, where you'll use your authority to guard the lives of not just Absalomians, but all who have come to your grand city to experience its wonders. Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Wisdom , and one is a free ability boost. You're trained in the Religion skill and your choice of a specific religion Lore skill (such as Iomedae Lore or Norgorber Lore). You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Deception, Diplomacy, and Intimidation checks to interact with Graycloaks, priests, and clerics. You gain the Quick Identification feat.",

  "text": " Post Guard of All Trade Source Agents of Edgewatch Player's Guide pg. 8 Not all cops are passionate about their jobs. For some, the pursuit of justice is just another way to pay the bills. Honestly, it was probably the Post Guard's generous time-off policy that drew you to their service, and during your yearly sabbaticals you've dabbled in hobbies as diverse as fishing, baking, or even stand-up comedy. Even while on duty, you're probably idly fiddling with a lucky coin or practicing magic tricks with a deck of cards. You probably irritate your fellow guards a bit with your non sequiturs, casual attitude, and tendency to daydream, but results don't lie, and more often than not you prove your worth when the chips are down. For all the excitement of guarding Absalom's Postern Gate, the Post Guard wasn't really the right fit for someone as distractible as yourself, so your boss put in a “promotion” for you to transfer to the newly formed Edgewatch. You're all for the reassignment, since it will put you smack in the middle of the most entertaining and diverse gathering of the century, the Radiant Festival. Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Intelligence , and one is a free ability boost. You're trained in the Performance skill, a Lore skill of your choice, and you gain a bonus language. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Deception, Diplomacy, and Intimidation checks to interact with Post Guards. You gain the Dubious Knowledge skill feat.",

Now that you are here, alone but determined, you won't let anything stand in your way. Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Charisma , and one is a free ability boost.

There's intense pressure on you to be up to the task, and the fickle nature of prophecy complicates your path. Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Charisma , and one is a free ability boost. Decide with your GM the basics of the prophecy in which you're meant to play a major part. You're trained in one skill related to the prophecy, and the Fortune-Telling Lore skill. You gain the Prophecy's Pawn free action. Prophecy's Pawn Free Action (abjuration, divine, fortune) Trigger You fail a saving throw, attack roll, or skill check; Effect You twist the prophecy in your favor, which will have consequences later. Reroll the failed check. You must use the result of the second roll. For 24 hours afterward, the GM can force you to reroll a successful saving throw, attack roll, or skill check as fate balances the scale. This is a misfortune effect. You can't use prophecy's pawn again until the GM uses this option or 24 hours pass, whichever comes first.",

You and your family were forced to evade monsters, mutants, wild magic, and worse, as each new day heralded the possibility of a danger or threat you'd never seen before. You learned to adapt to the worst possible conditions and how to forage and survive in a place few others would dare to live. Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

When you're not thinking about your next brawl, you're turning over memories of traitorous rivals and troublesome betrayers who've wronged you in the past. The sight of your enemies broken and maimed, then, greatly appealed to you when you glimpsed through a mysterious glowing archway during the Missing Moment. But when you stepped through the gate, you found yourself back where you started, with no indications of your exacted revenge anywhere in sight. You nearly burned down the countryside in frustrated rage, only realizing afterward the magnitude of the fiery new power you wielded. Fiery rays of energy you could shoot from your eyes—these, no doubt, would come in handy. Your deviant abilities are of the dragon classification.

The next moment, however, you were standing right where you'd just been, though indeterminate time had passed. The night's cold hardly bothered you; in fact, you soon discovered that you could absorb the very chill in the air, in the process changing the appearance of everything around you into a sheen of finest silver.

  "text": " Wishes for Riches Source Gatewalkers Player's Guide pg. 8 On the night of the Missing Moment, you saw visions of fabulous riches in the gate before you. Honestly, how someone could see anything but piles of jewels and gold is utterly baffling to you. Having pined for material wealth for as long as you could remember, you practically sprang into the portal in hopes of securing your fortune. The next moment, however, you were standing right where you'd just been, though indeterminate time had passed. The night's cold hardly bothered you; in fact, you soon discovered that you could absorb the very chill in the air, in the process changing the appearance of everything around you into a sheen of finest silver. You're no richer than before you walked through the gate, unfortunately, but perhaps you could use this new power somehow to pursue your avarice anew. Your deviant abilities are of the dragon classification. You gain the Consume Energy deviant feat with the cold type. As a quirk, your deviant abilities manifest in a silver hue, and when you use a deviant ability you absorb the color silver from your surroundings. The absorbed color returns to your surroundings within an hour. Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost. You're trained in the Thievery skill, and the Games Lore skill. You gain the Subtle Theft skill feat.",

  "text": " Hammered by Fate Source Stolen Fate Player's Guide pg. 11 Your life has been difficult, in no small part due to the influence of all things fiendish in your past. You might be a tiefling whose heritage has resulted in you being shunned or ostracized by society, or you could be any ancestry who grew up in a land where fiendish influence lingers—such as devil-haunted Cheliax or the realm of Sarkoris Scar, where the influence of the Worldwound and its demonic invaders yet linger. Perhaps you carry an old scar or wound from a frightening encounter with a demon, have a fiend-related element as part of your class (such as a sorcerer bloodline or a fiendish patron whom you worship), or endured a long-term affliction from a fiendish source that only recently has been alleviated. Whatever the case, fate has thrown horror and terror at you at every turn, and that's taught you to always be ready for whatever those fiends might have in store for you next. This background is associated with the suit of Hammers. Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength , and one is a free ability boost. You gain the Hefty Hauler skill feat and are trained in one of the following Lore skills, as fits your history: Daemon Lore, Demon Lore, or Devil Lore. You also gain the following free action. Harrow the Fiend Free Action (fortune) Trigger You start your turn in combat against a foe or foes you recognize to be fiends; Frequency once per day; Effect You gain a +1 status bonus on all Strikes or spell attack rolls against fiends for the duration of combat. Once during combat, you can draw a harrow card after you determine if a Strike or spell attack on a fiend hits but before you determine damage or effects caused to the fiend. If you draw a card from the suit of Hammers, increase the degree of success of your Strike or spell attack by one.",
