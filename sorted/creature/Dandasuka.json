Born to manipulate and murder, these half-sized terrors revel in their work and delight in the sight of blood. They often dress in extravagant clothes dyed with ostentatious colors and wear numerous elaborate accessories, whether in their true form or in disguise as human children, halfling merchants, or anything else that helps them blend into their targeted society.\n\n A dandasuka rakshasa is constantly haunted by a monstrous hunger that gnaws at its hyperactive body, forcing it to feed often. In combat, a dandasuka might pause to lick a bloody blade or lap at a pool of spilled blood on the floor. These creatures settle for other meat when they must, but much prefer the taste of mortal humanoid flesh. Regular offers of such victuals can keep a dandasuka loyal to anyone willing to provide frequent meals, but care must be taken in keeping a dandasuka, for many stories tell of them being overly eager to serve an adored benefactor, taking off-hand remarks too literally, and performing services of violence that were never intended.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Fiend](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 20\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 18\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 15\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Rakshasa_Dandasuka.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 5\">[Dandasuka](/Monsters.aspx?ID=344)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"LE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Small\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fiend\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=70\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Rakshasa\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=233\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 274</row>\n\n**Perception** +12; darkvision\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Infernal](/Languages.aspx?ID=19), [Undercommon](/Languages.aspx?ID=11)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +13, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +14, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +13, [Thievery](/Skills.aspx?ID=17) +13\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +1\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +3\r\n\r\n**Int** +1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +1\r\n\r\n**Cha** +3\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 23 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +12 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +13 \r\n\r\n**Will** +10 \r\n\r\n+2 status to all saves vs. magic, +3 status to all saves vs. divine magic\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 60\n\n**Resistances**\r\nphysical 5 (except piercing)\r\n\r\n**Weaknesses**\r\ngood 5\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 25 feet, climb 20 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nfangs +15 ([Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179), [Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103)),\r\n**Damage** 2d6+4 piercing plus 1d6 persistent bleed\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nclaw +15 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179), [Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103)),\r\n**Damage** 2d4+4 slashing\r\n\r\n**Occult Spontaneous Spells** DC 22, attack +15\r\n- **Cantrips (1st)**\r\n[Daze](/Spells.aspx?ID=61), [Detect Magic](/Spells.aspx?ID=66), [Ghost Sound](/Spells.aspx?ID=132), [Mage Hand](/Spells.aspx?ID=177), [Sigil](/Spells.aspx?ID=286)\r\n- **1st**\r\n[Charm](/Spells.aspx?ID=34), [Ventriloquism](/Spells.aspx?ID=356) (4 slots)\r\n\r\n**Occult Innate Spells** DC 19\r\n- **3rd**\r\n[Clairaudience](/Spells.aspx?ID=39), [Mind Reading](/Spells.aspx?ID=194) (at will)\r\n- **4th**\r\n[Clairvoyance](/Spells.aspx?ID=40)\r\n\r\n**[Change Shape](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=8)** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([Concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32), [Occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120), [Polymorph](/Traits.aspx?ID=127), [Transmutation](/Traits.aspx?ID=157)) The dandasuka takes on the appearance of any Small humanoid.
