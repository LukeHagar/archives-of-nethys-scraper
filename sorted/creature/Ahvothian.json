They resemble humanoid [dinosaurs](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=32) with narrow, fanged heads similar to raptors and solid, heavy legs like sauropods. Relentless trackers and survivalists, ahvothians are skilled at navigating jungles and are most commonly encountered stalking prey or operating out of fortified ruins. Ahvothians have an uncanny affinity with reptiles, and they often use dinosaurs—particularly carnivores such as allosauruses or [deinonychuses](/Monsters.aspx?ID=118)—as hunting companions or guard animals. Although dangerous in large groups, ahvothians have such a strong desire to assert dominance over others that ahvothian armies frequently fall to infighting and bloody battles for dominance within days, or even hours. The mightiest ahvothians might lead dozens of their kin and herds of carnivorous dinosaurs.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Fiend](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 25\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 23\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 20\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 7\">[Ahvothian](/Monsters.aspx?ID=983)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"CE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fiend\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=70\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [The Slithering](/Sources.aspx?ID=41) pg. 62</row>\n\n**Perception** +18; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Abyssal](/Languages.aspx?ID=12), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1); [_speak with animals_](/Spells.aspx?ID=293)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +19, [Crafting](/Skills.aspx?ID=4) +11, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +15, [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13) +11, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +17\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +6\r\n\r\n**Dex** +2\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** +0\r\n\r\n**Wis** +4\r\n\r\n**Cha** +2\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n[javelins](/Weapons.aspx?ID=71) (3), [Longspear](/Weapons.aspx?ID=6), trophies (beast and humanoid)\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 25 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +18 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +12 \r\n\r\n**Will** +15 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 160\n\n**Resistances**\r\nfire 10\r\n\r\n**Weaknesses**\r\ncold 5, good 5\r\n\r\n**[Attack of Opportunity](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=3)** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> \r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 30 feet; [_freedom of movement_](/Spells.aspx?ID=128)\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njaws +18,\r\n**Damage** 2d10+8 piercing\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nlongspear +18 ([reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 1d8+8 piercing plus wicked trophies\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njavelin +14 ([thrown 30 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=195)),\r\n**Damage** 1d6+8 piercing plus Wicked Trophies\r\n\r\n**Divine Innate Spells** DC 23\r\n- **1st**\r\n[Charm](/Spells.aspx?ID=34) (at will)\r\n- **2nd**\r\n[Death Knell](/Spells.aspx?ID=63) (at will)\r\n- **3rd**\r\n[Earthbind](/Spells.aspx?ID=94) (at will), [Fear](/Spells.aspx?ID=110) (at will)\r\n- **4th**\r\n[Creation](/Spells.aspx?ID=54)\r\n- **Constant (4th)**\r\n[Freedom of Movement](/Spells.aspx?ID=128), [Speak with Animals](/Spells.aspx?ID=293)\r\n\r\n**Reptile Master**   When an ahvothian uses an innate spell against a reptile, the DC is 27 rather than 23.\r\n\r\n**Wicked Trophies**   An ahvothian chooses a creature type (such as [animal](/Traits.aspx?ID=9), [celestial](/Traits.aspx?ID=23), or [humanoid](/Traits.aspx?ID=91)) from which they currently carry a trophy from a past kill.
