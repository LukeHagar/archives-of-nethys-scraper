Their brand of evil is organized, manipulative, and regal. Blue dragons often lair near or within cities and set out to bend the population to their will and gather hordes of servants. These dragons love spinning webs of conspiracy. A blue dragon’s lackeys typically don’t even realize that they serve a dragon, but instead think the protection money, tariffs, or taxes they are amassing is treasure for a cruel but legitimate master. In some ways, blue dragons even see their servants as a living hoard and value them like treasure. These dragons have been known to use these tactics even with their own chromatic cousins.\n\n Not all blue dragons work clandestinely. Some lord over desert tribes and hill people like vengeful gods, demanding both tribute and worship. No matter how blue dragons manage their underlings, their bearing is regal and their lairs palatial; they’re universally intolerant of insubordination, incompetence, and embezzlement, and punish perpetrators with murderous efficiency.\n\n Blue dragons are also known for their use and mastery of illusion magic. They make use of illusions to augment their manipulations and bewilder their foes in battle. Blue dragons also have some control over water, but use this ability to destroy water, something quite dangerous for those who encounter them in their desert lairs.\n\n The ideal lair for a blue dragon contains multiple passages, rooms, and secret chambers. As social creatures, blue dragons prefer to host guests in comfort—but their dwellings should not be so public that just anyone can come calling. A force of guards keeps out intruders, and clever illusions conceal the edifice from prying eyes. Rather than a pile of coins or gems, a blue dragon’s true hoard is the rich furnishings in its citadel— expensive art, ornate furniture, and architectural marvels.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Dragon](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2)): DC 40\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 38\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 35\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/DragonBlue_AncientBlueDragon.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 18\">[Ancient Blue Dragon](/Monsters.aspx?ID=132)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"LE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Huge\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Dragon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=50\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Electricity\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=56\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 108</row>\n\n**Perception** +31; darkvision, scent (imprecise) 60 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Auran](/Languages.aspx?ID=15), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Draconic](/Languages.aspx?ID=2), [Ignan](/Languages.aspx?ID=18), [Infernal](/Languages.aspx?ID=19), [Jotun](/Languages.aspx?ID=8)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +28, [Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2) +33, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +35, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +35, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +33, [Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14) +35, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +28, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +29\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +7\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +6\r\n\r\n**Int** +7\r\n\r\n**Wis** +5\r\n\r\n**Cha** +7\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Sound Imitation** The dragon can mimic any sound it has heard.
