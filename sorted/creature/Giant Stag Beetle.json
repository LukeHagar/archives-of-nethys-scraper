Its enormous mandibles are used to impress mates, intimidate rivals, and discourage predators, for they can deliver deadly blows. While giant stag beetles are deadly predators, they can be domesticated by skilled wranglers. In such a capacity, these beetles serve well as beasts of burden or even as mounts.\n\n Giant stag beetles can be a serious menace in marshes, cavern complexes, and heavy forests. More than one logging camp has attracted a cluster of giant stag beetles and had to be completely abandoned, yielding all its lumber to the hunger of the giant insects.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Animal](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 19\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 17\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 14\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Beetle_GiantStagBeetle.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 4\">[Giant Stag Beetle](/Monsters.aspx?ID=50)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Animal\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=9\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 41</row>\n\n**Perception** +10; darkvision\r\n\r\n**Languages**\n\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +9, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +13\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +5\r\n\r\n**Dex** +1\r\n\r\n**Con** +5\r\n\r\n**Int** -5\r\n\r\n**Wis** +2\r\n\r\n**Cha** -1\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 22 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +13 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +9 \r\n\r\n**Will** +8 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 55\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 20 feet, fly 20 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nmandibles +13,\r\n**Damage** 2d8+5 piercing\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nfoot +11,\r\n**Damage** 1d10+5 bludgeoning\n\n**[Trample](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=39)** <actions string=\"Three Actions\" />  Medium or smaller, foot, DC 21\r\n\r\n</column>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"creature-family-14\" />",
