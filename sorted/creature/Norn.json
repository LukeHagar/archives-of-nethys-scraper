They watch over all life, intervening with reluctance when called uponâ€”or with a vengeance when the strands of fate are twisted and abused by lesser beings.\n\n Norns' relationship with the Eldest of the First World is complex. Many among norns serve [Magdh](/Deities.aspx?ID=97) the Three, the triune Eldest who some norns believe to be the first norn triumvirate bound together into one entity, as Magdh has three bodies: a Maiden, a Mother, and a Matriarch. Magdh claims to be watching the threads of fate for some ominous prophesied cataclysm, and in addition to assisting in her divinations, Magdh expects the norns who serve her to follow her cryptic commands to help nudge the future away from the brink. However, norns are powerful beings in their own right, themselves capable of granting divine power, and many balk at serving the enigmatic demigod. These norns find the other Eldest even more alien and challenging to interact with, for they believe that while the Eldest wield great power, even these powerful beings should not be granted leave to meddle with fate as much as they desire.\n\n While even the weakest of the Eldest could destroy an unaffiliated norn with ease, they tend to obey the proclamations and judgments of norns when they are spoken. These norns, for their part, use their perceived neutrality judiciously. They know better than to issue too many demands to the Eldest, lest the capricious demigods grow frustrated and tired of norns' interference. And so the balance of power remains tenuous between unaffiliated norns and the Eldest, as it has for eons. However, norns know that it's merely a matter of time before the Eldest lose their respect for this tradition and start acting entirely as they please, despite norns' best efforts to rein in their most disruptive actions.\n\n A norn stands 14 feet tall and weighs 800 pounds.\n\n \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Worshipping Norns</title> On the Material Plane, some mortals worship norns as deities, while others, especially witches and bards, admire them as patrons or muses. Those who uphold norns as deities are known as [Followers of Fate](/Deities.aspx?ID=210). Norns do little to discourage this veneration, but neither do they go out of their way to support such worship. Clerics who venerate norns might worship a specific norn or norn triumvirate, or all norns as a whole, but they gain the same benefits regardless of their choice. The religious symbol of Followers of Fate is a pair of shears cutting a golden thread, and their areas of concern are destiny, fate, and the aging process.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Fey](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 45\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 43\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 40\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Norn.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 20\">[Norn](/Monsters.aspx?ID=742)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Rare\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=137\" />\r\n<trait label=\"LN\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fey\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=69\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 184 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +41; [_detect magic_](/Spells.aspx?ID=66), [greater darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), [lifesense 120 feet](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=21), [_true seeing_](/Spells.aspx?ID=344)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Jotun](/Languages.aspx?ID=8), [Sylvan](/Languages.aspx?ID=10); [_tongues_](/Spells.aspx?ID=340)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Crafting](/Skills.aspx?ID=4) +36, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +35, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +37, [Lore (all)](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +28, [Medicine](/Skills.aspx?ID=9) +38, [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11) +34, [Performance](/Skills.aspx?ID=12) +31, [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13) +34\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +7\r\n\r\n**Dex** +6\r\n\r\n**Con** +6\r\n\r\n**Int** +6\r\n\r\n**Wis** +10\r\n\r\n**Cha** +7\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Sense Fate** ([fortune](/Traits.aspx?ID=76)) A norn automatically rolls a 20 when she rolls initiative.<br />**Triumvirate** This functions as the [coven](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=11) ability, except only norns can join a triumvirate, and it functions only as long as exactly three norns are part of the triumvirate.

If both the fortune and misfortune effect are from a norn, then the two cancel each other out as normal. At the GM's discretion, powerful entities related to fate or luck, like [Desna](/Deities.aspx?ID=5), [Magdh](/Deities.aspx?ID=97), or [Pharasma](/Deities.aspx?ID=14), count as a norn for the purpose of this ability.\r\n\r\n**Sever Fate**  ([Necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117), [Occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120)) When a norn deals negative damage with a Strike, she regains 10 Hit Points.

If the norn chooses the lower roll, this is a [misfortune](/Traits.aspx?ID=110) effect; if she chooses the higher roll, it's a [fortune](/Traits.aspx?ID=76) effect; if they're the same, she decides which trait to apply.\r\n\r\n**Snip Thread** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([Death](/Traits.aspx?ID=40), [Manipulate](/Traits.aspx?ID=104), [Necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117), [Occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120)) **Frequency** three times per day; **Effect** The norn produces a golden thread linked to the fate of a creature within 100 feet of her, then snips it short with her shears. The target takes 100 negative damage (DC 42 basic Fortitude save). If the target is reduced to 0 Hit Points from this damage, the thread is completely severed and the creature dies immediately. A creature slain by Snip Thread can't be restored to life except by [_miracle_](/Spells.aspx?ID=196), [_wish_](/Spells.aspx?ID=377), or similarly powerful magic; or by divine intervention. Regardless of the outcome of their saving throw, a creature targeted by Snip Thread then becomes temporarily immune for 24 hours.
