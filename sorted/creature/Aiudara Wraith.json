Each time an individual travels through an _aiudara_, there’s a chance their passage could leave a faint imprint of their subconscious in the network. Normally this imprint simply fades away, but when an _aiudara _is damaged or the individual is suffering from necromantic contagions, these imprints can accumulate and, in time, coalesce on the Astral Plane or within Alseta’s Landing as a full-fledged aiudara wraith. The wraith is forced to live with an incomplete sense of self, always seeking its own memories and swiftly growing violent and vengeful as its quest to reclaim these ephemeral notions constantly meets with failure.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Astral](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11)): DC 43\r\n\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Undead](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 43\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 41\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 38\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/AiudaraWraith.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 18\">[Aiudara Wraith](/Monsters.aspx?ID=488)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Rare\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=137\" />\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Astral\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=14\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Incorporeal\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=222\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Undead\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=160\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Wraith\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=260\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #150: Broken Promises](/Sources.aspx?ID=15) pg. 78</row>\n\n**Perception** +33; darkvision, lifesense 60 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Elven](/Languages.aspx?ID=4), [Necril](/Languages.aspx?ID=20)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +35, [Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2) +31, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +35\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** -5\r\n\r\n**Dex** +9\r\n\r\n**Con** +5\r\n\r\n**Int** +0\r\n\r\n**Wis** +7\r\n\r\n**Cha** +8\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 45 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +33 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +37 \r\n\r\n**Will** +33 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 300\r\n([negative healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=42))\n\n**Immunities**\r\ndeath effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, precision, unconscious\r\n\r\n**Resistances**\r\nall damage 15 (except force, _ghost touch_, or positive; double resistance vs. non-magical)\n\n**Teleportation Attachment** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> ([conjuration](/Traits.aspx?ID=33), [teleportation](/Traits.aspx?ID=156)) **Trigger** A creature within 60 feet uses a teleportation effect; **Effect** The aiudara wraith teleports with the creature, arriving in an empty space of its choice adjacent to the triggering creature’s destination.
