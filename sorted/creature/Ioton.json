Known as iotons, these beings lack the willpower to manifest physical bodies, much less the self-awareness and vision to know what form these physical bodies might take. Instead, they manifest as ghostly, cloudlike wisps, each intermittently forming ephemeral features like alien eyes, unspeaking mouths, and shimmering symbols as iotons instinctively process their surroundings. Left alone, they might drift for ages amidst the Silver Sea.\n\n Gregariously parasitic, iotons sense and congregate around thinking beings, eagerly tearing off stray thoughts and using the harvested psychic energy to think clearly and form physical bodies. An ioton might understand that this process inflicts painful headaches in its victims, but it typically doesn't care. Not only do most of these ennosites become drunk on their newfound mental power and cling to their captured thoughts, but returning what they stole also robs an ioton of the mental bandwidth necessary to parse right from wrong. This sometimes causes a painful cycle where it repeatedly steals thoughts, apologetically surrenders them, and then blithely steals the thoughts anew.\n\n Iotons that gradually accumulate and consolidate enough mental potential form a permanent body, transforming into another type of ennosite.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Astral](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11)): DC 14\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 12\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 9\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Ennosite_Ioton.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 0\">[Ioton](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1146)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Tiny\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Astral\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=14\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Incorporeal\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=222\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 3](/Sources.aspx?ID=66) pg. 92</row>\n\n**Perception** +3; thoughtsense (imprecise) 60 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\nabsorbed language\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +6, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +6\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** -5\r\n\r\n**Dex** +2\r\n\r\n**Con** +3\r\n\r\n**Int** +0\r\n\r\n**Wis** -1\r\n\r\n**Cha** -3\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Absorbed Language** While a creature is taking [persistent damage](/Conditions.aspx?ID=29) from the ioton, the ioton gains the ability to speak and understand one of that creature's languages, selected at random.<br />**Thoughtsense** ([divination](/Traits.aspx?ID=47), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120)) The ioton senses all non-[mindless](/Traits.aspx?ID=108) creatures at the listed range.\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 14 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +7 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +6 \r\n\r\n**Will** +3 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 14\n\n**Immunities**\r\n[disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126), precision\r\n\r\n**Resistances**\r\nall damage 2 (except [force](/Traits.aspx?ID=75), [_ghost touch_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=297), or [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106); double resistance against non-[magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103))\r\n\r\n**Weaknesses**\r\nmental 3\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** fly 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\ntouch +6 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [Mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)),\r\n**Damage** 1d4 [persistent mental damage](/Conditions.aspx?ID=29) and leech thought\r\n\r\n**Occult Innate Spells** DC 14\r\n- **Cantrips (1st)**\r\n[Daze](/Spells.aspx?ID=61), [Detect Magic](/Spells.aspx?ID=66)\r\n\r\n**Leech Thought**  ([Healing](/Traits.aspx?ID=89), [Occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120), [Polymorph](/Traits.aspx?ID=127), [Transmutation](/Traits.aspx?ID=157)) While a creature is taking persistent mental damage from the ioton, the ioton takes the shape of a creature familiar to the target, such as an acquaintance, pet, or common animal, though the appearance is imperfect and grants no benefit to [Impersonate](/Actions.aspx?ID=46) an individual.<br /> While transformed, the ioton loses its [incorporeal](/Traits.aspx?ID=222) trait, immunities, and resistances, but it gains an unarmed melee Strike with a +6 attack modifier that deals 1d8+2 bludgeoning damage.
