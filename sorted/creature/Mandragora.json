These insidious little plants typically form when a mandrake root is watered with a [demon's](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=28) blood. Upon absorbing the otherworldly properties of the demon's blood, the root animates and is forced to seek out blood to feast from, lest it die of thirst.\n\n Always famished and in search for sustenance, mandragoras live haunted, pained lives and perform vile and desperate acts to acquire the blood they crave. While they prefer magically infused blood such as that of unicorns, fey, or sorcerers, and they can also feed off of potions, alchemical bombs, and other magical elixirs, a mandragora can subsist on the blood of non-magical creatures. They find the flavor of mundane blood to be bland and bitter, and they do not blanch at voicing these complaints to the creatures from which they drink.\n\n While the typical mandragora is the size of a human child, some of these evil plants continue to grow and grow, reaching sizes more comparable to those of giants. Sometimes as they grow, they form additional limbs or rudimentary faces, eventually transforming into truly hideous mockeries of the human form.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Plant](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 19\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 17\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 14\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Mandragora.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 4\">[Mandragora](/Monsters.aspx?ID=727)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"CE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Small\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Plant\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=125\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 170 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +11; blood scent, [low-light vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=23)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Abyssal](/Languages.aspx?ID=12), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +10, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +10, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +12\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +2\r\n\r\n**Dex** +5\r\n\r\n**Con** +3\r\n\r\n**Int** -1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +2\r\n\r\n**Cha** +0\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Blood Scent** A mandragora can smell creatures with blood as an imprecise sense at a range of 30 feet, and it can smell [demons](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=28), [fey](/Traits.aspx?ID=69), and [sorcerers](/Classes.aspx?ID=11) with blood as a precise sense at a range of 30 feet.\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 21 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +11 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +13 \r\n\r\n**Will** +8 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 60\n\n**Resistances**\r\nbludgeoning 5, electricity 5\r\n\r\n**Weaknesses**\r\nfire 5\r\n\r\n**Vulnerability to Supernatural Darkness** Whenever a mandragora begins its turn in an area of magical darkness, it is [slowed 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=35) on that turn.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 30 feet, burrow 10 feet, climb 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njaws +14 ([Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179)),\r\n**Damage** 2d8+4 piercing plus [Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=18)\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nthorny vine +14 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179), [reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 2d4+4 slashing plus mandragora venom\n\n**Blood Drain** <actions string=\"Single Action\" />  **Requirements** The mandragora has a creature [grabbed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=20); **Effect** The mandragora drains blood from the creature it has grabbed, dealing 2d6 damage.
