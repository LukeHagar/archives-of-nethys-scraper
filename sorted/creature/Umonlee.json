Ancient Erutaki who made their homes in the frozen polar expanse called the Crown of the World named this monster the umonlee.\n\n Umonlees are bestial predators who constantly hunt, rarely resting in service of a hunger that is never fully sated. Despite this animalistic drive, umonlees are semi-intelligent creatures who often select and stalk their prey. However, they are not terribly bright and often keep their hunting grounds in sparsely-trafficked areas. It is rare for an umonlee to attack a village, but one might attack a sparse group, such as a hunting or scouting party. Many caravans traversing the Path of Aganhei—the trade route between the continents of Avistan and Tian Xia that crosses the Crown of the World—have had their expeditions abruptly ended by an encounter with one of these monstrosities.\n\n Those who study monsters posit that umonlees are related to [chuuls](/Monsters.aspx?ID=81), as the creatures exhibit some similarities. Both are semi-intelligent, crustacean predators that use ambush tactics to kill and eat their prey. Even though they can talk, umonlees typically only speak [Aklo](/Languages.aspx?ID=13), which also gives credence to this theory. This would also lend to the theory that chuuls are products of [alghollthu](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=1) manipulation, meaning that umonlees are also the results of these alien designs. However, the fact that these creatures aren't evil argues well against such a theory.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Beast](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2), [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 36\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 34\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 31\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Umonlee.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 15\">[Umonlee](/Monsters.aspx?ID=839)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Huge\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Amphibious\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=207\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Beast\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=20\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Cold\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=27\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 271 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +25; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), [tremorsense (imprecise) 80 feet](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=40)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Aklo](/Languages.aspx?ID=13)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +31, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +24\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +8\r\n\r\n**Dex** +3\r\n\r\n**Con** +7\r\n\r\n**Int** -3\r\n\r\n**Wis** +2\r\n\r\n**Cha** +3\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 39 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +28 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +26 \r\n\r\n**Will** +23 \r\n\r\n+1 status vs. mental\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 320\n\n**Immunities**\r\ncold\r\n\r\n**Resistances**\r\nmental 10\r\n\r\n**Weaknesses**\r\nfire 15\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 50 feet, burrow 25 feet, swim 40 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njaws +31 ([reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 3d6+16 piercing plus 3d6 cold\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\npincers +31 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [reach 15 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 3d8+16 slashing plus [Improved Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=27)\n\n**Freezing Breath** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([Cold](/Traits.aspx?ID=27), [Evocation](/Traits.aspx?ID=65), [Incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=93), [Primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=134)) The umonlee breathes a cone of extremely cold air that damages its prey and can freeze them to the ground.
