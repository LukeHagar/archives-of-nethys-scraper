Their convenience makes them popular among the wicked, as each resides within a glass bottle which normally seems to contain only a small amount of red liquid. When addressed by their owner, a polong appears within their bottle as a tiny, beautiful humanoid drenched in blood. Forcing one to manifest outside the bottle reveals their true shape: a blood-soaked spirit with a hateful visage and sickle-shaped claws.\n\n The ritual to create a polong originated in Minata and is known primarily by Tian-Sing spellcasters, but only those willing to practice such evil. The ritualist must collect the blood of a murdered humanoid in a small bottle and perform daily incantations, which can take up to 14 days. Once the polong forms, they drink the blood of their creator every day, most often taken from a finger inserted into their bottle. At the master's order, a polong will travel up to 10 miles away to locate a particular person, possess them, and either slowly whittle them down via possession until they die, or force them to attack anyone nearby until someone slays the victim in self-defense.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Spirit](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11)): DC 26\r\n\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Undead](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 26\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 24\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 21\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Polong.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 8\">[Polong](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1891)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Incorporeal\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=222\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Spirit\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=149\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Undead\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=160\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Book of the Dead](/Sources.aspx?ID=118) pg. 138</row>\n\n**Perception** +17; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), [lifesense](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=21) 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\nany one language known by the polong's creator\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +18, [Medicine](/Skills.aspx?ID=9) +15, [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11) +13, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +18\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** -5\r\n\r\n**Dex** +6\r\n\r\n**Con** +2\r\n\r\n**Int** +1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +5\r\n\r\n**Cha** +6\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Bottle Bound** A polong is bound to the bottle from which they spawned.
