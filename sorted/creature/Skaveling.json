Their creators are the bloodsucking [urdefhans](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=158) of the Darklands, who create skavelings from [giant bats](/Monsters.aspx?ID=46) specially raised on diets of toxic fungus and the flesh of ghouls—especially brains harvested from these undead. Upon reaching maturity, these giant bats are ritually slain via the use of [cytillesh oil](/Equipment.aspx?ID=110). While this poison simply rots away the flesh of most creatures, one of these specially prepared bats will immediately rise from death as a skaveling after succumbing to its effects.\n\n Despite its tattered wings and sagging skin, a skaveling is more than capable of flight, even when carrying a creature mounted on its back—urdefhans often use skavelings as mounts in this way. Their intelligence is more advanced than that of the typical giant bat, and in combat they function more as allies than as mere mounts, capable of making their own tactical decisions. Yet even though they can reason and think, skavelings remain loyal to the urdefhans who created them, and they never take actions in a fight that would knowingly put their masters in harm's way.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Undead](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 20\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 18\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 15\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Skaveling.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 5\">[Skaveling](/Monsters.aspx?ID=803)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"CE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Undead\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=160\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 241 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +15; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), echolocation 40 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\n\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +13, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +13, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +11\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +6\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +2\r\n\r\n**Int** +1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +6\r\n\r\n**Cha** +2\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Echolocation** A skaveling can use its hearing as a precise sense at the listed range\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 22 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +11 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +13 \r\n\r\n**Will** +15 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 80\n\n**Immunities**\r\n[death](/Traits.aspx?ID=40) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126), [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38)\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 15 feet, fly 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nfangs +15,\r\n**Damage** 2d8+8 plus ghoul fever and paralysis\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nwing +15 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170)),\r\n**Damage** 2d4+8 plus paralysis\n\n**Bone-Chilling Screech** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([Auditory](/Traits.aspx?ID=16), [Emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [Fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=68), [Mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [Necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117), [Occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120)) The skaveling unleashes a horrifying screech that chills the very bones of those close enough to feel it.
