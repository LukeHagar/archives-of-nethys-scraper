At first glance, kishis appear to be attractive [humans](/Ancestries.aspx?ID=6), usually of a local ethnicity, but their full heads of thick hair conceal a second face: that of a snarling hyena. When a kishi lures their prey into a vulnerable situation, their head swivels around, revealing this fearsome visage. In this form, a kishi's powerful jaws are almost impossible to pry loose and can crush a victim's bones in a matter of moments.\n\n Kishi range widely in their physical features, and their height and weight vary as much as the people whose communities they infiltrate. They dress in fine clothing aligned with the latest fashion trends, and they wear flashy jewelry with the intention of drawing onlookers' eyes.\n\n Like most fey, a kishi has inscrutable motives, though to their victims, the kishi's goal seems simple—to revel in the expression of shock, betrayal, and terror on a victim's face. Although kishis can cast [_charm_](/Spells.aspx?ID=34) to make unwitting companions complacent, most of these sinister creatures prefer to trick their prey using guile, gifts, and their dashing good looks. These ultimate sadists derive pleasure from the thrill of the hunt as well as the delicious reward at the end. The more uptight, prudish, or haughty a target, the better—for nothing satisfies kishis as much as earning (and destroying) the trust of someone who rarely grants it.\n\n When kishis get their new friends or lovers alone, they choose the most dramatic moments to reveal their true monstrous forms and clamp their jaws down on their victim. Kishis have no desire to share their true nature with the entire community, so they typically aim for the throats of their victims, who can no longer cry out for help after being cut off from air. Kishis consume every part of their victims' bodies, leaving no trace of the crime—even lapping up any spilled blood, claiming the victim's treasures as their own, and cleaning the murder scene as much as possible.\n\n Few things can bind a community together as swiftly as uncovering a kishi. Once found out, a kishi flees, hoping to find a new community to prey upon.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Fey](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 24\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 22\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 19\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Kishi.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 8\">[Kishi](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1208)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fey\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=69\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 3](/Sources.aspx?ID=66) pg. 149, [Pathfinder #146: Cult of Cinders](/Sources.aspx?ID=7) pg. 88</row>\n\n**Perception** +14; [low-light vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=23)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Sylvan](/Languages.aspx?ID=10)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +18, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +20, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +19, [Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14) +15, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +18\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +6\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +1\r\n\r\n**Int** +1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +2\r\n\r\n**Cha** +5\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 25 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +13 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +18 \r\n\r\n**Will** +17 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 138\n\n**Resistances**\r\npiercing 10\r\n\r\n**Weaknesses**\r\n[cold iron](/Equipment.aspx?ID=375) 10\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 25 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njaws +20,\r\n**Damage** 2d10+9 piercing plus [Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=18)\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nclaw +20 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170)),\r\n**Damage** 2d8+9 slashing\r\n\r\n**Arcane Innate Spells** DC 27\r\n- **1st**\r\n[Charm](/Spells.aspx?ID=34) (at will)\r\n\r\n**[Constrict](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=10)** <actions string=\"Single Action\" />  1d10+9 piercing, DC 26 (grabbed by jaws only).\r\n\r\n**Head Spin** <actions string=\"Free Action\" />  The kishi switches between showing their attractive human face and their snarling hyena face.
