The genesis of an obrousian is a tragic one: some merfolk forsake their aquatic homes when they fall in love with a land dweller, only to be spurned or rejected. Having given up their entire world for another and then feeling that new world closed off to them as well, merfolk can become emotionally overwhelmed. When such merfolk die, often overcome with sorrow and regret, they rise as obrousians.\n\n Obrousians think of little other than taking revenge upon the land dwellers who specifically wronged them, and then upon anyone else with the misfortune to cross their paths. They can contort their bodies to take the guise of other humanoids, but doing so is painful, so obrousians use this ability only when absolutely necessary to enact their schemes. While they are capable of long-term planning, their underlying mental turmoil simmers beneath any careful preparation, and many obrousians foil their own plans with unexpected outbursts of emotion.\n\n Obrousians are recognizable as the merfolk they once were before they died, though their bodies show obvious decay and their hands have elongated into sharp claws. Their voices are melodic and entrancing, belying their rotting bodies and turbulent minds, so some obrousians hide in tall reeds or under docks before speaking to their victims, lulling them into false comfort with a pleasant voice.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Undead](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 34\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 32\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 29\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Obrousian.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 14\">[Obrousian](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1888)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Amphibious\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=207\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Undead\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=160\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Book of the Dead](/Sources.aspx?ID=118) pg. 134, [Pathfinder #161: Belly of the Black Whale](/Sources.aspx?ID=51) pg. 86</row>\n\n**Perception** +26; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Aquan](/Languages.aspx?ID=14), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Necril](/Languages.aspx?ID=20)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +26, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +27, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +25, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +24, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +26\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +6\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +3\r\n\r\n**Int** +0\r\n\r\n**Wis** +4\r\n\r\n**Cha** +7\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 36 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +25 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +22 \r\n\r\n**Will** +28 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 250\r\n([negative healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=42))\n\n**Immunities**\r\n[death](/Traits.aspx?ID=40) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126), [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38)\n\n**Waves of Sorrow** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61), [incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=93), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) 30 feet.
