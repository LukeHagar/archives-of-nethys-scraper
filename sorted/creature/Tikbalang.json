They deceive and mislead with their formidable magic, leaping from tree to tree while laughing, or neighing, uncontrollably. While not malicious, neither are they empathetic to the plight of their victims. They would sooner forget about those whom they have played tricks on and leave them to die than lead them back to their intended path through guilty altruism.\n\n A tikbalang's occult magic stems from the esoteric mystery of believing the lie. In the moment of crafting illusions or conjuring extradimensional spaces, the tikbalang themself believes that what they are creating is real. This makes their spells harder to resist, and this same principle also makes them very effective liars. But this readiness to believe also makes them susceptible to deceptions and illusions in turn, and they are particularly vulnerable to mind games. Lone travelers without magic of their own often learn riddles, sleight of hand, or other tricks to defend against a tikbalang's oft-deadly entertainment. Other whispers suggest wearing one's shirt inside-out to confuse the creatures, or passing by a tikbalang's forest quietly to avoid drawing their attention.\n\n Unlike most illusionists, tikbalangs can also rely on their physical prowess should the need arise. They have unusually long legs that end in cloven hooves, and they stand as tall as ogres when upright. Skilled climbers and leapers, they are also well known for being master wrestlers, where their long limbs put them at a distinct advantage over their foes. They have elongated faces that, when combined with their well-kempt hair, suggest an equine appearance—although some tikbalangs have saurian or birdlike faces instead.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Beast](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2), [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 28\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 26\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 23\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Tikbalang.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 9\">[Tikbalang](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1338)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"CN\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Amphibious\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=207\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Beast\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=20\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 3](/Sources.aspx?ID=66) pg. 267</row>\n\n**Perception** +16; [low-light vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=23)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Sylvan](/Languages.aspx?ID=10)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +20, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +21, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +14, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +17, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +16\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +5\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** -1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** +6\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 27 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +19 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +17 \r\n\r\n**Will** +14 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 197\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\nmental 10\r\n\r\n**Believe the Lie** The tikbalang takes a –2 circumstance penalty to saves against [illusion](/Traits.aspx?ID=92) spells, and to their Will DC against checks to [Lie](/Actions.aspx?ID=47) to them.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nfist +20 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170)),\r\n**Damage** 2d6+8 bludgeoning\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nhoof +20 ([reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 2d10+8 bludgeoning\r\n\r\n**Occult Innate Spells** DC 29\r\n- **4th**\r\n[Hallucinatory Terrain](/Spells.aspx?ID=145), [Hypnotic Pattern](/Spells.aspx?ID=157)\r\n- **8th**\r\n[Maze](/Spells.aspx?ID=187) (once per week)\r\n\r\n**[Change Shape](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=8)** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([Concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32), [Occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120), [Polymorph](/Traits.aspx?ID=127), [Transmutation](/Traits.aspx?ID=157)) The tikbalang takes on the appearance of any Medium or Large [humanoid](/Traits.aspx?ID=91).
