Cunning, powerful, and ruthless, pit fiends often serve the archdevils directly. They rule infernal duchies, subjugate mortal worlds, and usurp infernal rivals using unparalleled despotism and calculated ferocity. To realize their tyrannical machinations, pit fiends claim mortal souls that they corrupt into lemure servants, which can then be shaped and transformed through infernal manipulation into the terrifying devils that form Hell’s formidable legions. They often select the most wicked and vicious lemures for their armies, drawing upon these lesser devils’ depravity during powerful magical ceremonies to create hideous and terrifying abominations that can cow and eviscerate the pit fiend’s enemies.\n\n Pit fiends themselves are crafted deep within the nightmarish bowels of Nessus, the ninth layer of Hell, to serve the whims of archdevils and infernal dukes. Those pit fiends that don’t leave Nessus to command infernal legions in the upper layers of Hell often form the courts of Hell’s elite, gathering cabals and sects that shape Hell’s political landscape through subterfuge and manipulation. But many pit fiends see themselves as living embodiments of hellfire, the all-encompassing wrath of Hell, and thus prefer to dwell in realms consumed by fire. In Avernus, Dis, Malebolge, Nessus, and Phlegethon, pit fiends build vast citadels of brimstone wreathed in flame to lord over.\n\n Pit fiends tower over other devils, standing at least 16 feet tall, weighing over 1,000 pounds, and brandishing wingspans in excess of 20 feet. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Infernal Dukes</title> Elite members of Hell’s political infrastructure and leadership hierarchy, the dukes of Hell are chosen from among the most tyrannical, oppressive, and conniving devils. While not all infernal dukes are pit fiends, a pit fiend’s natural disposition toward conquest and oppression often make it an ideal candidate for this position. To create an infernal duke, adjust the pit fiend to be between 21st and 25th level. Because of their physical prowess, manipulative nature, and powerful spellcasting abilities, infernal dukes make excellent villains for long-running campaigns.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Fiend](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 40\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 38\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 35\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Devil_PitFiend.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 20\">[Pit Fiend](/Monsters.aspx?ID=114)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"LE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Devil\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=44\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fiend\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=70\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 92</row>\n\n**Perception** +37; greater darkvision, [_true seeing_](/Spells.aspx?ID=344)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Celestial](/Languages.aspx?ID=16), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Draconic](/Languages.aspx?ID=2), [Infernal](/Languages.aspx?ID=19); telepathy 100 feet\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +34, [Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2) +32, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +33, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +39, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +34, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +39, [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13) +37, [Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14) +36, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +34\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +9\r\n\r\n**Dex** +8\r\n\r\n**Con** +9\r\n\r\n**Int** +8\r\n\r\n**Wis** +9\r\n\r\n**Cha** +8\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 46 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +37 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +32 \r\n\r\n**Will** +35 \r\n\r\n+1 status to all saves vs. magic\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 335\r\n\r\n, regeneration 30 (deactivated by good)\r\n\r\n**Immunities**\r\n[fire](/Traits.aspx?ID=72)\n\n**Resistances**\r\nphysical 15 (except [silver](/Equipment.aspx?ID=379)), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126) 15\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\ngood 15\r\n\r\n**Commander’s Aura** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61)) 100 feet.
