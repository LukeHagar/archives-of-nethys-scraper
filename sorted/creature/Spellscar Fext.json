The magical feedback that snuffed out their life warped and animated their flesh, twisting them into shambling undead. Spellscar fexts stand 6 feet tall with disproportionately long arms that end in clusters of waving magical tendrils.\n\n Almost all who became spellscar fexts entered the Mana Wastes to harness the power of the area's wild magic. Once transformed, the desire for magical power becomes a spellscar fext's singular motivation. The creatures focus their attacks on magic users they encounter, attempting to kill them and strip their magic. Unfortunately for a spellscar fext, their transformation makes their entire being inimical to magic. They're unable to cast even the simplest of spells. They grasp destructively at magic they can never hold.\n\n Difficult for the unprepared to destroy permanently, spellscar fexts harry trade routes known for shipping magical goods and repeatedly attack arcane workshops on the borders of the Mana Wastes. They're particularly dangerous to spellcasters traveling alone, as battling the creatures might trigger a wellspring surge that could destroy the lone magic user.\n\n As the fext's vulnerability to glass weapons has become more well known, enterprising gunsmiths in Alkenstar have begun crafting glass ammunition, an uncommon item that costs the same as [cold iron ammunition](/Equipment.aspx?ID=375).\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Undead](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 25\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 23\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 20\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/SpellscarFext.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 7\">[Spellscar Fext](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2415)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"CE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Undead\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=160\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Impossible Lands](/Sources.aspx?ID=146) pg. 337</row>\n\n**Perception** +15; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), magic sense (imprecise) 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Necril](/Languages.aspx?ID=20)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +13, [Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2) +17, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +17, [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11) +17\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +6\r\n\r\n**Dex** +2\r\n\r\n**Con** +1\r\n\r\n**Int** +4\r\n\r\n**Wis** +4\r\n\r\n**Cha** +2\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Magic Sense** ([arcane](/Traits.aspx?ID=11)) The spellscar fext detects the source and school of each source of magic within 30 feet as an imprecise sense.\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 25 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +12 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +15 \r\n\r\n**Will** +17 \r\n\r\n+1 status versus [magic](/Traits.aspx?ID=103)\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 100\r\n([negative healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=42))\r\n, regeneration 10 (deactivated by glass)\r\n\r\n**Immunities**\r\n[death](/Traits.aspx?ID=40) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126), [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38)\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\nglass 10\r\n\r\n**Unstable Feedback** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> **Trigger** A creature Casts a Spell on the spellscar fext, and the spellscar fext either succeeds at its saving throw versus the spell or the caster fails the spell attack roll against the spellscar fext; **Effect** The caster of the triggering spell undergoes a [wellspring surge](/Rules.aspx?ID=1576).
