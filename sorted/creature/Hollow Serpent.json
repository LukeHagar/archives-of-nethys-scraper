According to the oldest holy books of [serpentfolk](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=151), the first hollow serpents were raised by [Ydersius](/Deities.aspx?ID=211). The god took the cast-off skins of great snakes and filled them with hunger and hatred, a bottomless yearning for mortal life that could never be filled. In due course, the priests of the serpentfolk learned to replicate their lord's trick, and in the millennia since the serpentfolk's fall, the knowledge has slithered into the libraries of other necromancers and sorcerers.\n\n Despite their menacing reputation and great power, hollow serpents are a relatively uncomplicated creation. They were designed first and foremost as guardians, and serpentfolk liches of a suitable level of power are sometimes accompanied by hollow serpents. A few have struck out on their own over the years, usually due to outliving their original creators. Driven by their hunger and dim intellect, they take up residence in remote ruins or deep caverns. Those that study such things believe at least one serpent, perhaps one of the original creatures made by Ydersius, survives in the mountains west of Geb.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Undead](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 34\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 32\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 29\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/HollowSerpent.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 15\">[Hollow Serpent](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1872)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Undead\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=160\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Book of the Dead](/Sources.aspx?ID=118) pg. 114</row>\n\n**Perception** +27; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), [lifesense](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=21) 60 feet, [scent](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=33) (imprecise) 60 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Aklo](/Languages.aspx?ID=13)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +29, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +30, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +29\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +7\r\n\r\n**Dex** +8\r\n\r\n**Con** +6\r\n\r\n**Int** -2\r\n\r\n**Wis** +4\r\n\r\n**Cha** +3\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 37 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +26 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +30 \r\n\r\n**Will** +24 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 280\r\n([negative healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=42))\n\n**Immunities**\r\n[disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126), [polymorph](/Traits.aspx?ID=127), [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38)\n\n**Desiccation Aura** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) 30 feet.
