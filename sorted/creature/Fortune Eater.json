When a number of would-be heroes perish together in such a way, their restless spirits might arise—spurred by jealousy—to become a fortune eater. A fortune eater is a collective entity that might lurk near fortune tellers, taverns, or Pathfinder Society lodges where adventurers are likely to pass through. The spirit then follows the heroes on their quests until the right moment, when the spirit manifests their unfortunate abilities to get the party killed and potentially add them to the collective. Sometimes they linger near the lairs of a powerful monster, waiting for parties of unwary adventurers.\n\n A fortune eater lingers because of unfinished business: to move on, they must help a hero defeat a great threat or acquire a legendary item. Ironically, their jealousy, rage, and powers of bad luck make this extremely unlikely.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Spirit](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11)): DC 28\r\n\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Undead](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 28\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 26\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 23\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/FortuneEater.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 7\">[Fortune Eater](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1157)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Rare\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=137\" />\r\n<trait label=\"CE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Incorporeal\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=222\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Spirit\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=149\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Undead\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=160\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 3](/Sources.aspx?ID=66) pg. 101</row>\n\n**Perception** +13; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\nlanguages spoken by the adventurers (typically [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Dwarven](/Languages.aspx?ID=3), [Elven](/Languages.aspx?ID=4), and [Goblin](/Traits.aspx?ID=81))\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +15, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +13, [Performance](/Skills.aspx?ID=12) +15, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +15\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** -5\r\n\r\n**Dex** +6\r\n\r\n**Con** +0\r\n\r\n**Int** +2\r\n\r\n**Wis** +2\r\n\r\n**Cha** +4\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 25 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +15 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +17 \r\n\r\n**Will** +13 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 100\r\n([negative healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=42), rejuvenation)\n\n**Immunities**\r\n[death](/Traits.aspx?ID=40) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126), precision, [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38)\r\n\r\n**Resistances**\r\nall damage 5 (except [force](/Traits.aspx?ID=75), [_ghost touch_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=297), or [positive](/Traits.aspx?ID=128); double resistance against non-[magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103))\n\n**Rejuvenation** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) Offering the fortune eater a chance to be instrumental in completing a heroic deed releases their component spirits to move on to the afterlife.<br />**Unluck Aura** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [divination](/Traits.aspx?ID=47), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [misfortune](/Traits.aspx?ID=110)) 20 feet.
