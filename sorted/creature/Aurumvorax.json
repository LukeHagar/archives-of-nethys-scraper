A typical aurumvorax is only 3 feet long but weighs more than 200 pounds, for its thick, sturdy bones are densely packed with muscle, making the creature very strong but a notoriously poor swimmer. Its fur is golden, sometimes with a silvery or russet tone depending on the metals it has ingested, and its claws are always the shiny black of seasoned iron.\n\nAurumvorax adults claim hunting territories spanning a mile or more, driving out other predators and leading solitary lives except when they mate. They are irascible creatures, impossible to train as adults, but daring trainers can rear aurumvorax pups as deadly guard beasts, which they sell for hundreds of gold pieces to discriminating buyers. Aurumvorax pups are usually single births, and their mothers are fiercely protective, making their acquisition a dangerous proposition. Even when trained, the creatures are prone to dangerous bursts of rage.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Animal](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 26\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 24\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 21\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Aurumvorax.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 9\">[Aurumvorax](/Monsters.aspx?ID=558)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Small\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Animal\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=9\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 29 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +18; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), [scent (imprecise) 30 feet](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=33)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\n\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +20, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +18\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +6\r\n\r\n**Dex** +2\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** -4\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** +0\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 28 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +19 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +17 \r\n\r\n**Will** +16 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 170\n\n**Tenacious Stance** An aurumvorax gains a +4 circumstance bonus to its Fortitude or Reflex DC against [Shove](/Actions.aspx?ID=38) and [Trip](/Actions.aspx?ID=40) attempts, and to its [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) DC against attempts to escape its [Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=18).<br />**[Ferocity](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=16)** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> \r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 35 feet, burrow 10 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njaws +21,\r\n**Damage** 2d10+12 piercing plus [Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=18)\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nclaw +21 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170)),\r\n**Damage** 2d8+12 slashing plus [Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=18)\n\n**Bleeding Critical**   When an aurumvorax scores a critical hit, the target takes 1d6 [persistent bleed damage](/Conditions.aspx?ID=29).\r\n\r\n**Gnaw Metal** <actions string=\"Single Action\" />  The aurumvorax makes a jaws Strike against a creature it has grabbed.
