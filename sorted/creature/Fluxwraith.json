The target automatically reappears in the same location after 1d4 rounds but can attempt an additional Will save at the end of each of its turns to end the duration. If its original space is occupied when it returns, the creature appears in the nearest unoccupied space. Since the creature is shunted forward in time, it doesn't experience any of the intervening time. Likewise, any effects on the creature with a duration don't decrease their duration, resuming when the creature reappears. A creature that succeeds at any saving throw against time shift is temporarily immune for 1 hour.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_6_Geb.png\">Creating a Fluxwraith</title>\r\n\r\nA powerful necromancer can try to create a fluxwraith by subjecting someone to unstable temporal magic, usually by inflicting it on an unwilling victim.
