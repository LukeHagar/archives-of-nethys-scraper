Over centuries, this energy animates the tar into a relentless and horrifying ooze.\n\n Tar oozes begin their existence in tar pits, naturally occurring lakes of thick and sticky petroleum. Tar pits make effective traps for animals and humanoids alike, as they're often covered with thin layers of dirt or grass or reflect sunlight in a way that resembles a watering hole. Once a creature steps or falls into the sticky tar of the pit, escape is all but impossible. Slowly, the caught creature—and any other victims lured near by its plaintive cries—sinks into the tar, suffocates, and dies.\n\n Magic inherent in a captive creature or carried in powerful magic items carried by the dead remains inside the tar, where it gathers, mixes, and slowly energizes it until it begins to move and seek prey. A tar ooze seeps slowly over the land, catching anything it touches in a sticky embrace and devouring it.\n\n Living things consumed by the ooze slowly have their flesh digested, only for the bones and fur to be replaced with blobs of sticky tar. These unnatural zombies eventually crawl away, hungry for flesh. Without a master to give them instructions, these [tar zombies](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=303) often follow the ooze that created them, swarming anyone bold or foolish enough to get in their way.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Ooze](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11)): DC 29\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 27\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 24\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Ooze_TarOoze.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 10\">[Tar Ooze](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1815)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Huge\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Mindless\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=108\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Ooze\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=122\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #177: Burning Tundra](/Sources.aspx?ID=116) pg. 82</row>\n\n**Perception** +18; motion sense 60 feet, no vision\r\n\r\n**Languages**\n\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +23, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +13\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +8\r\n\r\n**Dex** -3\r\n\r\n**Con** +8\r\n\r\n**Int** -5\r\n\r\n**Wis** +0\r\n\r\n**Cha** -5\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Motion Sense** A tar ooze can sense nearby motion through vibration and movement.\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 18 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +22 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +10 \r\n\r\n**Will** +15 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 255\n\n**Immunities**\r\ncritical hits, [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), precision, [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38), [visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=163)\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\n[fire](/Traits.aspx?ID=72) 10\r\n\r\n**Sticky** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> **Trigger** The tar ooze is hit by a melee attack; **Effect** The ooze attempts to [Grapple](/Actions.aspx?ID=35) the creature that hit it.
