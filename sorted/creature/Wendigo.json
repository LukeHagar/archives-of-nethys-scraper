If the target succeeds at a DC 38 Will save, it prevents itself from being transformed; in this case, the wendigo still transforms, automatically releasing the victim. A creature forced to Ride the Wind along with the wendigo is exposed to wendigo torment.

It then becomes affected by [_wind walk_](/Spells.aspx?ID=376) and sprints into the sky so fast that its feet burn away into jagged stumps.

Howl Three Actions (Auditory, Concentrate, Enchantment, Fear, Incapacitation, Mental, Primal) Frequency Three times per day; Effect The wendigo unleashes a forlorn howl that can be heard up to 1 mile away.
