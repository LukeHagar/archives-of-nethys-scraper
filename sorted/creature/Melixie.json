Melixies take the insectile wings common among winged fey and up the ante with antennae and additional insect features, typically shared with bees but sometimes with butterflies, moths, ladybugs, or other beetles. Melixies live in a pattern of rapid consumption of sweets, incredible productivity in tasks of all sorts, and then a crash to sleep it all off and start again. Melixies in their productive state even engage happily in large-scale repetitive tasks that most sprites find dreadfully dull. In their spare time, melixies love to dance, and some of them learn a dancelike sign language called Melisylvan, allowing them to communicate a full range of information through movement. \r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Fey](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 14\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 12\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 9\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 0\">[Melixie](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1322)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"CN\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Tiny\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fey\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=69\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Sprite\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=238\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 3](/Sources.aspx?ID=66) pg. 254</row>\n\n**Perception** +4; [low-light vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=23)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Sylvan](/Languages.aspx?ID=10); speak with arthropods\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +6, [Confectionery Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +6, [Crafting](/Skills.aspx?ID=4) +6, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +6\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** -1\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +2\r\n\r\n**Int** +2\r\n\r\n**Wis** +0\r\n\r\n**Cha** +3\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Speak with Arthropods** A melixie can communicate with arthropods, such as insects, spiders, scorpions, crabs, and similar invertebrate animals.
