Horai erect simple astronomical calendars near their home, which they use to mark the moment when the sun reaches its highest or lowest point in the sky. An hora tied to the summer solstice grows more powerful as the sun reaches its height, while an hora tied to the winter solstice is sickly and weak. The opposite holds true for winter horai, who are weak in summer and strong in winter. Meanwhile, autumn and spring horai draw power near the autumnal and vernal equinoxes, becoming weaker around the opposite equinox. <br />Summer horai appear constantly bathed in sunlight, with skin and clothing of red, orange, and yellow, like the sunlight of high summer.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Fey](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 27\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 25\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 22\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Nymph_SummerHora.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 6\">[Summer Hora](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1813)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Rare\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=137\" />\r\n<trait label=\"CG\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fey\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=69\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Nymph\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=230\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #177: Burning Tundra](/Sources.aspx?ID=116) pg. 80</row>\n\n**Perception** +14; [low-light vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=23)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Elven](/Languages.aspx?ID=4), [Sylvan](/Languages.aspx?ID=10); [_speak with animals_](/Spells.aspx?ID=293), [_speak with plants_](/Spells.aspx?ID=294)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +13, [Astronomy Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +15, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +11, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +13, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +14, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +15, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +14\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +1\r\n\r\n**Dex** +5\r\n\r\n**Con** +2\r\n\r\n**Int** +3\r\n\r\n**Wis** +4\r\n\r\n**Cha** +5\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Summer Bound** During the winter months, a summer hora can't take reactions, is [sickened 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=34), and can't reduce their sickened condition below 1.\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 24 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +11 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +14 \r\n\r\n**Will** +17 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 90\n\n**Resistances**\r\n[fire](/Traits.aspx?ID=72) 5\r\n\r\n**Weaknesses**\r\n[cold iron](/Equipment.aspx?ID=375) 5\r\n\r\n**Solstice Dependent** An hora is mystically bonded to a natural location with a simple astronomical calendar that marks the summer and winter solstice.

Winter horai have resistance to [cold](/Traits.aspx?ID=27) rather than to [fire](/Traits.aspx?ID=72) and Strikes that deal cold damage rather than fire damage. Similarly, autumn horai have resistance to [negative](/Traits.aspx?ID=118) energy and Strikes that deal negative damage; spring horai have no resistance and Strikes that deal positive damage (which only harms [undead](/Traits.aspx?ID=160) and creatures with [negative healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=42), as normal). Winter horai have the Winter Bound ability which impairs them during the summer months, and winter horai queens reverse the effects of their Tied to the Land ability (their land is healthy during the winter and withers during the summer). Similarly, autumn and spring horai are impaired during the opposing months, and their queens' Tied to the Land abilities change accordingly. Winter horai have Winter's Rescue rather than Summer's Salvation, which gives a +4 status bonus during the month of the winter solstice (Kuthona on Golarion), a +2 status bonus on the months before and after it (Neth and Abadius), a +1 bonus on most other months, and no benefit during the three summer months. Similarly, autumn and spring horai have reactions that grant a +4 status bonus during the month of their equinox, a +2 status bonus on the months just before and after, a +1 status bonus on other months, and no benefit during the opposing equinox and the months just before and after.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"creature-family-77\" />",
