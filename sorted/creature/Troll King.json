These champions develop a number of talents that make them worthy leaders and potent hunters—namely their abilities to willingly boost the rate of their regeneration and to shake off the acid and fire that would hinder it, not to mention a bestial roar that can send would-be predators scurrying off. Troll kings possess a cunning far beyond their younger kin— they know to keep their allies close, and their enemies even closer.
