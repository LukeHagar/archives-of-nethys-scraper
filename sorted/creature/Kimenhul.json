These powerful sahkils focus their attention on mortals who are seemingly at the peak of their ability yet harbor secret fears of inadequacy. A kimenhul's predations can leave an indelible mark on its victims. The kimenhul whispers threats and sends fears of crushing failure to its prey, seemingly originating from their own minds, a trauma that can be difficult to bear without help. These sahkils torment their prey as long as the hapless victims live, using their Eternal Fear ability every day to psychically remind their previous victims of their failings.\n\n Some unique kimenhuls find themselves in a position of leadership in Xibalba (see the sidebar below), where they carve out their own small kingdoms and direct groups of sahkils to help them find mortals to torment.
