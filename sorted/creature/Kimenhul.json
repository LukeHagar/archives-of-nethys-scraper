These powerful sahkils focus their attention on mortals who are seemingly at the peak of their ability yet harbor secret fears of inadequacy. A kimenhul's predations can leave an indelible mark on its victims. The kimenhul whispers threats and sends fears of crushing failure to its prey, seemingly originating from their own minds, a trauma that can be difficult to bear without help. These sahkils torment their prey as long as the hapless victims live, using their Eternal Fear ability every day to psychically remind their previous victims of their failings.\n\n Some unique kimenhuls find themselves in a position of leadership in Xibalba (see the sidebar below), where they carve out their own small kingdoms and direct groups of sahkils to help them find mortals to torment. They rule these nightmare kingdoms through terror, often delighting in tormenting new petitioners or scheming ways to work against their immortal foes.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Fiend](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 40\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 38\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 35\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Sahkil_Kimenhul.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 20\">[Kimenhul](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1285)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Huge\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fiend\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=70\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Sahkil\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=333\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 3](/Sources.aspx?ID=66) pg. 222</row>\n\n**Perception** +35; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), [_true seeing_](/Spells.aspx?ID=344)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Abyssal](/Languages.aspx?ID=12), [Celestial](/Languages.aspx?ID=16), [Infernal](/Languages.aspx?ID=19), [Requian](/Languages.aspx?ID=34); [telepathy](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=37) 100 feet\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +36, [Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2) +33, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +38, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +38, [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11) +33, [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13) +35, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +36\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +10\r\n\r\n**Dex** +8\r\n\r\n**Con** +9\r\n\r\n**Int** +5\r\n\r\n**Wis** +7\r\n\r\n**Cha** +7\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Easy to Call** A sahkil's level is considered 2 lower for the purpose of being conjured by the [_planar binding_](/Rituals.aspx?ID=17) ritual (and potentially other rituals, at the GM's discretion), but it is always free to attack or leave instead of negotiate unless the primary caster's check is a critical success.\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 45 [all-around vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=1)\r\n\r\n**Fort** +33 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +32 \r\n\r\n**Will** +35 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 425\n\n**Immunities**\r\n[death](/Traits.aspx?ID=40) effects, [fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=68)\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\ngood 20\r\n\r\n**Feed on Fear** The kimenhul regains 30 Hit Points at the start of its turn as long as any [frightened](/Conditions.aspx?ID=19) creature is within 100 feet of it.<br />**[Attack of Opportunity](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=3)** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> If the triggering creature is subject to an effect with the [fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=68) trait, the kimenhul can make two claw Strikes against the creature instead of one Strike.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 45 feet, climb 25 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njaws +38 ([Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [reach 15 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 4d12+18 piercing plus 3d6 evil\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nclaw +38 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [reach 15 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 4d8+18 slashing plus 3d6 evil and [Improved Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=27)\r\n\r\n**Divine Innate Spells** DC 42\r\n- **Cantrips (10th)**\r\n[Detect Magic](/Spells.aspx?ID=66)\r\n- **9th**\r\n[Confusion](/Spells.aspx?ID=48), [Dispel Magic](/Spells.aspx?ID=78) (at will), [Fear](/Spells.aspx?ID=110) (at will), [Mask of Terror](/Spells.aspx?ID=185) (at will), [Phantasmal Calamity](/Spells.aspx?ID=218), [Suggestion](/Spells.aspx?ID=315) (at will), [Warp Mind](/Spells.aspx?ID=369), [Weird](/Spells.aspx?ID=375)\r\n- **Constant (9th)**\r\n[Mind Blank](/Spells.aspx?ID=192), [True Seeing](/Spells.aspx?ID=344)\r\n\r\n**Eternal Fear** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([Divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [Emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [Enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61), [Fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=68), [Incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=93), [Mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) The kimenhul contorts its faces and presents itself to its enemies in a terrifying and traumatic display that causes lingering fear.
