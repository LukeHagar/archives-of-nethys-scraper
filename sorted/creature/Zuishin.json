Monasteries secreted away in snowy valleys, pagodas hidden in remote forests, and archways that mark the passage into sacred hidden cities all might host such kami. With sturdy armor and hallowed armaments, zuishin fight tirelessly to drive off any evil powers who wish to desecrate their wards. Of all kami, zuishin most frequently fight against [oni](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=144), as the wards zuishin guard are most often targeted for desecration by these vile fiends.\n\n Most zuishin wear ancient armor and wield powerful weapons like swords and bows, but some might use spears, axes, or only their fists, depending on their ward and the people who make offerings there. Zuishin tend to regard mortals with skepticism. To earn a zuishin's trust, a supplicant might offer items of natural significance, such as an urn of hallowed earth, a branch from an ancient tree, or an arrangement of local flowers.\n\n Like all kami, a zuishin might come across as reserved or even indifferent to humans and their ilk; however, this impression stems only from a zuishin's wisdom and longevity, which makes mortal affairs seem relatively trivial. In the company of other kami, however, they're unerringly benevolent and readily offer their aid to their fellows. For example, a zuishin whose ward lies nestled in an ancient forest might readily join forces with [kodama](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1202) in those trees to deter foes.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Spirit](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11)): DC 27\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 25\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 22\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Kami_Zuishin.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 10\">[Zuishin](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1203)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"LG\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Kami\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=354\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Spirit\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=149\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 3](/Sources.aspx?ID=66) pg. 144</row>\n\n**Perception** +21; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1); [telepathy](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=37) 100 feet\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +23, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +22, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +19, [Medicine](/Skills.aspx?ID=9) +21, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +21, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +21\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +6\r\n\r\n**Dex** +7\r\n\r\n**Con** +5\r\n\r\n**Int** +1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +5\r\n\r\n**Cha** +3\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Ward** ([abjuration](/Traits.aspx?ID=2), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48)) Every kami is bound to a ward: a specific animal, plant, object, or location.
