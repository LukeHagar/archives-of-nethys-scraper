The demon lord and his minions claim the air around the cliff, guarding it against enemies and usurpers alike. Hurlilus, resembling horned, humanoid hawks with blood-red taloned feet and wings in place of arms, patrol these skies at their lord's command. Yet, hurlilus are surly and rebellious by nature, preferring to lead rather than follow orders. They'd prefer to spend their time bullying smaller creatures in High M'Vania's vast cliffside cities, but they're unwelcome there and driven out when discovered by occupants with greater authority (or by those who want to earn greater authority).\n\n Hurlilus make good guardians, particularly when they have leave to travel over great distances on patrol routes and can engage in spontaneous cruelty if the opportunity arises. However, they chafe in Pazuzu's service. Some forsake High M'Vania entirely and migrate to other parts of the Abyss, where they lead gangs of lesser fiends they've bullied into submission. A few hurlilus have made their way to Golarion, where they roost in aeries with subservient [harpies](/Monsters.aspx?ID=258), [manticores](/Monsters.aspx?ID=294), or other foul flying creatures. A dozen or so hurlilus serve high positions in the Mivanians, the brutal enforcers of the Halana Theocracy.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Fiend](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 33\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 31\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 28\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Lilu_Hurlilu.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 11\">[Hurlilu](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2521)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Rare\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=137\" />\r\n<trait label=\"CE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fiend\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=70\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Lilu\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=497\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #190: The Choosing](/Sources.aspx?ID=198) pg. 88</row>\n\n**Perception** +21; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), [lifesense](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=21) (imprecise) 120 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Abyssal](/Languages.aspx?ID=12), [Auran](/Languages.aspx?ID=15), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1); [telepathy](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=37) 100 feet\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +24, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +20, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +22, [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13) +21, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +24\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +5\r\n\r\n**Dex** +7\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** +3\r\n\r\n**Wis** +4\r\n\r\n**Cha** +5\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Lifesense** ([divination](/Traits.aspx?ID=47), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48)) A hurlilu senses the vital essence of living creatures within range.\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 32 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +19 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +24 \r\n\r\n**Will** +21 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 170\n\n**Immunities**\r\n[disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46)\r\n\r\n**Resistances**\r\nphysical 10 (except [cold iron](/Equipment.aspx?ID=375)), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126) 10\r\n\r\n**Weaknesses**\r\ngood 10\r\n\r\n**Dominate the Air** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> **Requirements** The hurlilu is flying; **Trigger** A creature within 30 feet leaves the ground using a fly Speed; **Effect** The hurlilu casts [_earthbind_](/Spells.aspx?ID=94) on the triggering creature.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 25 feet, fly 60 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nbeak +24 ([Evil](/Traits.aspx?ID=64), [Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179), [Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [reach 15 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 2d10+11 piercing plus 1d6 [persistent bleed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=29)\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\ntalon +24 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Evil](/Traits.aspx?ID=64), [Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179), [Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 2d6+11 slashing plus 1d6 [persistent bleed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=29)\r\n\r\n**Primal Innate Spells** DC 30, attack +22\r\n- **Cantrips (6th)**\r\n[Detect Magic](/Spells.aspx?ID=66), [Produce Flame](/Spells.aspx?ID=236)\r\n- **4th**\r\n[Dimension Door](/Spells.aspx?ID=69) (at will), [Fear](/Spells.aspx?ID=110) (at will)\r\n- **5th**\r\n[Lightning Bolt](/Spells.aspx?ID=172), [Wall of Wind](/Spells.aspx?ID=367)\r\n- **6th**\r\n[Dispel Magic](/Spells.aspx?ID=78), [Earthbind](/Spells.aspx?ID=94) (at will), [Gust of Wind](/Spells.aspx?ID=143)\r\n\r\n**Dive Bomb** <actions string=\"Single Action\" />  **Frequency** once per round; **Effect** The hurlilu Strides using its fly Speed and makes a Strike at the end of that movement.\r\n\r\n**Flesh Tearer**   If a hurlilu critically hits a foe with a melee Strike, the foe's flat check to recover from any resulting [bleed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=29) damage is DC 19 instead of DC 15.\r\n\r\n</column>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"creature-family-336\" />",
