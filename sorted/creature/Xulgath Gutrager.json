They are stockier and faster, with necks and limbs corded with muscle. They are also denser, with multiple stomachs full of fluids even more caustic than those of the bilebearer. Like the bilebearer, gutragers lack the distinctive stench typical of most xulgaths.\n\n A gutrager’s torso conceals its most disturbing feature—a densely coiled esophagus. Pressurized bladders and a muscular throat allow the gutrager to propel its esophagus outward in an explosion of yellow flesh and acidic bile; caustic stomach acid coating the esophagus makes even brief physical contact with the organ dangerous. As a last resort, the gutrager can intentionally accelerate the corrosion in its esophagus, releasing vile acid in a burst that also ends its life.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 27\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 25\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 22\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Xulgath_XulgathGutrager.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 10\">[Xulgath Gutrager](/Monsters.aspx?ID=535)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"CE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Xulgath\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=244\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #154: Siege of the Dinosaurs](/Sources.aspx?ID=31) pg. 85</row>\n\n**Perception** +19; darkvision\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Draconic](/Languages.aspx?ID=2), [Undercommon](/Languages.aspx?ID=11)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +22, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +22, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +20\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +4\r\n\r\n**Dex** +6\r\n\r\n**Con** +7\r\n\r\n**Int** -2\r\n\r\n**Wis** +1\r\n\r\n**Cha** -1\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 28 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +23 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +22 \r\n\r\n**Will** +17 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 190\n\n**Resistances**\r\nacid 10\n\n**Caustic Fog** ([acid](/Traits.aspx?ID=3), [aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206)) 10 feet.
