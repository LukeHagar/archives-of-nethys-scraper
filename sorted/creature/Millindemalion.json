Many folk tales from around the world speak of industrious fey who help struggling crafters—cobblers, milliners, tailors, and so on—during the night, creating quality wares in secret for no payment greater than a crumb of bread or a saucer of cream. These stories hold a grain of truth, as gracious fey do occasionally journey from the [First World](/Planes.aspx?ID=10) to aid a humble artisan on a whim, for bribes of food, or sometimes even as part of a concerted effort to spread beauty throughout the world. However, when an artisan becomes too reliant on this help, their friendly fey helper might become warped and twisted with resentment and neglect. Eventually, they could transform into a cruel prankster who delights in punishing mortals who dare task a fey with such mundane work. The millindemalion is the result of a kindly, hat-making fey undergoing such a transformation. Some scholars believe this erratic behavior is caused by the preponderance of quicksilver used in most millinery.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Fey](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 31\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 29\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 26\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Millindemalion.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 13\">[Millindemalion](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1228)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Small\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fey\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=69\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 3](/Sources.aspx?ID=66) pg. 169</row>\n\n**Perception** +23; [low-light vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=23)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Aklo](/Languages.aspx?ID=13), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Sylvan](/Languages.aspx?ID=10)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Crafting](/Skills.aspx?ID=4) +28, [Millinery Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +30, [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11) +24, [Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14) +24, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +27\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +4\r\n\r\n**Dex** +8\r\n\r\n**Con** +1\r\n\r\n**Int** +7\r\n\r\n**Wis** +4\r\n\r\n**Cha** +2\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n_+1 [striking](/Equipment.aspx?ID=280) felt shears_ (as [dagger](/Weapons.aspx?ID=3))\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 34 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +20 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +27 \r\n\r\n**Will** +23 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 275\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\n[cold iron](/Equipment.aspx?ID=375) 10\r\n\r\n**[Attack of Opportunity](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=3)** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> The millindemalion can use Hat Toss against the triggering creature instead of making a Strike, making a melee attack roll with a +27 modifier to do so.<br />**Unsettling Mind** Attempting to touch the frenetic mind of a millindemalion is a dangerous task.
