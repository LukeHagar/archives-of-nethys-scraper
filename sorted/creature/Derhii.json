Although folklore can be in error, little doubt exists that these flying apes make excellent warriors. History is also clear that derhiis fought countless battles for the Shory Empire, honing their tactical skills and martial traditions. Regardless of whether Shory magic was responsible for the birth of the first derhiis, lore passed down from those times shows the Shory Empire honored their soldiers and treated them as valued allies rather than mere servants.\n\n Derhiis are scarce even in the Mwangi Expanse, where the last of the Shory flying cities, such as Kho and Ulduvai, fell. Still, some dwell among the spires that tower above Shory ruins; these derhii are often quite a bit more powerful than the one detailed below. Other derhiis have spread from the remains of the fallen Shory empire to populate remote highlands and old-growth forests.\n\n Derhiis form small filial groups called troops, centered on one elder derhii and their relations. Several troops might gather into a larger society with a council of troop leaders under one dominant elder.\n\n Derhiis are omnivores who favor meat, unlike the terrestrial and largely herbivorous gorillas they resemble. It's possible that this habit developed due to a derhii need for substantial amounts of food coupled with their soldierly ways.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 22\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 20\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 17\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Derhii.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 5\">[Derhii](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2527)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #191: The Destiny War](/Sources.aspx?ID=199) pg. 84</row>\n\n**Perception** +12; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), [scent](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=33) (imprecise) 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Auran](/Languages.aspx?ID=15), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +11, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +13, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +11\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +5\r\n\r\n**Dex** +2\r\n\r\n**Con** +3\r\n\r\n**Int** +0\r\n\r\n**Wis** +2\r\n\r\n**Cha** +0\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n[Falchion](/Weapons.aspx?ID=18), [Javelin](/Weapons.aspx?ID=71) (6), [Studded Leather Armor](/Armor.aspx?ID=5)\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 21 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +13 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +11 \r\n\r\n**Will** +11 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 80\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 25 feet, climb 25 feet, fly 35 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nfalchion +14 ([Forceful](/Traits.aspx?ID=180), [reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192), [Sweep](/Traits.aspx?ID=194)),\r\n**Damage** 1d10+7 slashing\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nfist +14 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 2d6+7 bludgeoning\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njavelin +14 ([thrown 30 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=195)),\r\n**Damage** 1d6+8 piercing\n\n**Booming Voice**  ([Auditory](/Traits.aspx?ID=16), [Evocation](/Traits.aspx?ID=65), [Primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=134)) A derhii can use its voice as a signal.
