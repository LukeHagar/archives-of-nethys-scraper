Nykteras share features with bats, but the type of bat varies by location, as nykteras tend to form small colonies in locations with bats similar to their own nature. A nyktera's sense of hospitality is such that they're willing to share with any who need it, even bitter foes. However, violating a nyktera's hospitality is one of their greatest taboos, inviting rare anger and retribution from the nyktera who was wronged, as well as their large extended family.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Fey](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 13\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 11\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 8\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Sprite_Nyktera.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature -1\">[Nyktera](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1321)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"NG\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Tiny\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fey\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=69\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Sprite\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=238\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 3](/Sources.aspx?ID=66) pg. 254</row>\n\n**Perception** +6; (8 to [Seek](/Actions.aspx?ID=84) creatures using hearing) [low-light vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=23)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Sylvan](/Languages.aspx?ID=10); speak with bats\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +5, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +5, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +5\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** -3\r\n\r\n**Dex** +3\r\n\r\n**Con** +0\r\n\r\n**Int** +0\r\n\r\n**Wis** +2\r\n\r\n**Cha** +3\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Speak with Bats** A nyktera can communicate with bats and use [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) to [Make an Impression](/Actions.aspx?ID=50) on bats and [Request](/Actions.aspx?ID=51) things from bats.<br />**Wrath of Spurned Hospitality** A nyktera whose hospitality is betrayed becomes enraged at the violation of a fundamental aspect of their fey nature.
