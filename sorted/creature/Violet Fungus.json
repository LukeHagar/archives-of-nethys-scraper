Only once one draws closer— once whip-like tentacles dripping with flesh-rotting venom slither out from the fungus's cratered cap—does the terrifying truth of this carnivorous toadstool become apparent. Many amateur spelunkers have met untimely ends in the clutches of this monstrous fungus's tentacles, since violet fungi are practically synonymous with caverns on Golarion.\n\n Anyone who has ever braved the world's caves for an extended period of time know the dangers of the deadly violet fungus. Darklands dwellers such as drow and duergars often bear the long, whip-like scars of at least one brush with this vicious plant's cruel, poison-infused tentacles. Canny subterranean trappers and scouts sometimes make use of cultivated violent fungi to catch game in the enormous caverns below the surface world. Some Darklands peoples also cultivate violet fungi as a means to defend their territory. [Xulgaths](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=102) in particular place violet fungi around the perimeters of their settlements as a first line of defense.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Fungus](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 18\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 16\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 13\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/VioletFungus.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 3\">[Violet Fungus](/Monsters.aspx?ID=853)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fungus\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=77\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Mindless\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=108\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 286 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +8; no vision, [tremorsense 60 feet](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=40)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\n\n**Skills**\r\n[Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +9\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +4\r\n\r\n**Dex** +0\r\n\r\n**Con** +3\r\n\r\n**Int** -5\r\n\r\n**Wis** +1\r\n\r\n**Cha** -2\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 17 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +10 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +7 \r\n\r\n**Will** +6 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 60\n\n**Immunities**\r\nbleed, [fatigued](/Conditions.aspx?ID=15), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126), [sleep](/Traits.aspx?ID=145), [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38)\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\nfire 5\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 10 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\ntentacle +11 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 1d10+4 bludgeoning plus violet rot\n\n**Violet Rot**  ([Poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126)) **Saving Throw** DC 20 Fortitude; **Maximum Duration** 6 rounds; **Stage 1** 1d6 poison plus [enfeebled 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=13) (1 round); **Stage 2** 1d6 poison plus enfeebled 1 and [drained 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=10) (1 round); **Stage 3** 2d6 poison plus enfeebled 1 and drained 1 (1 round)\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_5_TreasureAndRewards.png\">Deadly Whips</title>\r\n\r\nCanny adventurers can harvest a defeated violet fungus's tentacles and use them as [whips](/Weapons.aspx?ID=48).
