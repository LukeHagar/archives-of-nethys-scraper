Yeth hounds resemble lean, sleek dogs with overlarge ears and narrow paws that can tread on air as easily as the ground. Despite their canine appearance, yeth hounds are remarkably intelligent, although they rarely display this intelligence except when devising intricate tactics to ensnare their quarry. Their eerie bays echo across the countryside when they are engaged in a hunt, and they particularly enjoy baying to frighten and disorient intelligent creatures. Yeth hound packs can number as many as a dozen members, each working in uncanny communion with its packmates to corner and kill their prey. Yeth hounds like to drag their victims back to their lairs to eat at their leisure, so these lairs often contain discarded treasures from the hounds' previous meals.\n\n Yeth hounds despise two things: sunlight and other canines. They hunt only at night if they can, often breaking off their hunt at dawn to retreat to a subterranean lair or den, no matter how close they had come to catching their prey. Yeth hounds usually attack [wargs](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=98), [wolves](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=101), and similar creatures on sight, working to drive larger or more powerful canines from their hunting areas when then can't simply overpower and kill them.\n\n Evil rangers, bestial [demons](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=28), and wicked cults are frequently gifted yeth hound servants by fiendish patrons. Such hounds often serve as spies and are quick to turn against those who fail to advance the patrons' wicked aims. The cult of [Lamashtu](/Deities.aspx?ID=11), in particular, is fond of using yeth hounds as temple guardians.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Beast](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2), [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 18\r\n\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Fiend](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 18\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 16\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 13\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/YethHound.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 3\">[Yeth Hound](/Monsters.aspx?ID=870)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"CE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Beast\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=20\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fiend\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=70\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 302 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +9; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), [scent (imprecise) 30 feet](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=33)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Abyssal](/Languages.aspx?ID=12); (can't speak any language)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +8, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +9, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +10, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +8\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +4\r\n\r\n**Dex** +3\r\n\r\n**Con** +2\r\n\r\n**Int** -2\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** +1\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 18 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +9 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +12 \r\n\r\n**Will** +12 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 55\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\nsilver 5\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 40 feet; [_air walk_](/Spells.aspx?ID=6)\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njaws +11,\r\n**Damage** 1d8+6 piercing plus 1d6 evil, [Knockdown](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=20), and sinister bite\r\n\r\n**Divine Innate Spells** DC 20\r\n- **Constant (4th)**\r\n[Air Walk](/Spells.aspx?ID=6)\r\n\r\n**Bay** <actions string=\"Three Actions\" /> ([Auditory](/Traits.aspx?ID=16), [Concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32), [Divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [Enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61), [Fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=68), [Mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) The yeth hound emits an unearthly howl audible up to 300 feet away.
