More importantly, the unseen sight allows a Thresholder to see the truth of the world, granting them the ability to see things as they actually are as if they were under the effects of true seeing, provided they are located within a region under the influence of Yog- Sothoth. Currently in the Stolen Lands, this is limited to the island of Candlemere and the dungeons within it; beyond this area, the Thresholder cultists are blind. Of course, if their plan to draw Yog-Sothoth into the region succeeds, the region in which the unseen sight functions will increase dramatically...\r\n</aside>",
