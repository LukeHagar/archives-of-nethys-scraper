From beneath the docks and in the channels of settlements, bregdis wait for the careless or unlucky to fall into the water, where they make quick work of their hapless victims.\n\nAlthough bregdis have little more intelligence than most animals, a particularly opportunistic bregdi might realize that a fishing line often leads to a tasty meal. A bregdi that spots a fishing lure might grab it gently with its claw to imitate a fish caught on the line. Once a fisherman is “hooked” and starts to reel in, the bregdi plays along, slowly approaching the shore while making sluggish struggling motions. Once near land, the bregdi violently tugs on the lure to yank its unsuspecting prey into the water. Bregdis can survive out of water for short periods of time, but only the most desperate bregdis hunt on land.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Animal](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 28\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 26\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 23\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Bregdi.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 9\">[Bregdi](/Monsters.aspx?ID=999)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Animal\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=9\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Aquatic\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=168\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #159: All or Nothing](/Sources.aspx?ID=48) pg. 81</row>\n\n**Perception** +18; [low-light vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=23), [scent](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=33) (imprecise) 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\n\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +17, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +21, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +17, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +18\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +6\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** -4\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** -3\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Partial Amphibian** The bregdi can breathe air for up to 10 minutes, or up to an hour so long as its skin remains wet.\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 27 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +20 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +18 \r\n\r\n**Will** +17 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 180\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\nfire 10\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 20 feet, swim 40 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njaws +21 ([reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 2d12+8 piercing\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nhook claw +21 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 2d8+8 piercing plus Grab\n\n**[Aquatic Ambush](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=2)** <actions string=\"Single Action\" />  \r\n\r\n**Capsize** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([Attack](/Traits.aspx?ID=15)) The bregdi tries to capsize an adjacent aquatic vessel of its size or smaller.
