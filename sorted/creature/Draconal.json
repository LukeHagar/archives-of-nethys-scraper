With their wisdom comes an elevation above material matters, making them the most removed from the troubles and lives of mortals. Draconals serve as the guardians of powerful magic, and they dispense their wisdom in service of the greater good of [Nirvana](/Planes.aspx?ID=20) and the celestial planes.\n\n Draconals appear more draconic than humanoid. They walk on their hind legs and balance on their long, serpent like tails. Sharp claws tip their scaled humanoid hands.\n\n Similar to true dragons, a draconal's coloration signifies different breath weapons, traits, and resistances. Draconals also choose spells from one of four domains. All have the options of the [air](/Domains.aspx?ID=2) and [healing](/Domains.aspx?ID=15) domains, but their color determines the other two. Black draconals breathe and are resistant to fire, and their additional domain options are [fire](/Domains.aspx?ID=13) and [luck](/Domains.aspx?ID=18). Red draconals have the same fire breath and resistance, but their additional domain options are [protection](/Domains.aspx?ID=27) and [sun](/Domains.aspx?ID=29). Green and white draconals breathe and are resistant to cold, but green draconals have the options of [nature](/Domains.aspx?ID=22) and [water](/Domains.aspx?ID=35) domains while white draconals have the options of [freedom](/Domains.aspx?ID=14) and [repose](/Domains.aspx?ID=49).

They can make this effect [nonlethal](/Traits.aspx?ID=188) for selected creatures in the area or choose not to damage certain creatures at all. They can't use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds.\r\n\r\n**Dragon's Wisdom**   Draconals embody the core value of wisdom, but every path to wisdom and enlightenment differs, so draconals' powers vary by temperament and coloration. A draconal's scale color determines their associated energy damage type. They gain resistance 15 to that damage type, deal 4d6 extra damage of that type with their Strikes, and deal 21d6 damage of that type with their breath weapon. They gain additional wisdom in the form of the basic and advanced domain spells from one domain, chosen from four domains available to draconals with their scale color.
