The gnome grew up in Pitax and, of all that nation's rulers he'd observed, Irovetti impressed him the most with his admiration of art and style. That the king wasn't very supportive of art styles and pursuits he didn't enjoy never even registered in Tartuccio's mind, as his tastes were so similar.\n\n And so Tartuccio set into motion plans to catch the king's attention, so as to become first his student, then his trusted advisor, and in time his replacement. He even went as far as to seek out, research, and learn a potent magical technique that allowed him to change shape, intending to use this newfound supernatural power to adjust his appearance to be something more pleasing to the king's eye when the time came to petition to become his student. Tartuccio spent months scouring the rumor mills for opportunities, and when he heard of [Lady Jamandi's](/NPCs.aspx?ID=2195) call for heroes to expand into the Stolen Lands, he saw his chance. Tartuccio gathered his supplies and headed east.\n\n Once the events of Chapter 1 play out, Tartuccio is unsettled by the amount of competition he faces. He travels into the Stolen Lands where he's heard rumors of a [kobold](/Ancestries.aspx?ID=18) settlement that's ripe for the taking, uses his ability to change shape to assume the appearance of an unusual purple kobold, and work the Sootscales into a sort of private army he intends on using to wrest control of the PCs' nation just as they get started. His hopes of using the PCs' kingdom as a stepping-stone are threatened by the untimely conflict with the [mitflits](/Monsters.aspx?ID=245) of the Old Sycamore, as detailed in Chapter 2.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 29\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 27\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 24\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Tartuccio.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 4\">[Tartuccio](/NPCs.aspx?ID=2199)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Unique\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=161\" />\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Small\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Gnome\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=80\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Kingmaker Adventure Path](/Sources.aspx?ID=150) pg. 605</row>\n\n**Perception** +9; [low-light vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=23)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Draconic](/Languages.aspx?ID=2), [Gnomish](/Languages.aspx?ID=5), [Hallit](/Languages.aspx?ID=37), [Sylvan](/Languages.aspx?ID=10)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Bardic Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +8, [Crafting](/Skills.aspx?ID=4) +8, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +12, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +10, [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11) +10, [Performance](/Skills.aspx?ID=12) +12, [Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14) +10, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +11, [Thievery](/Skills.aspx?ID=17) +9\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +0\r\n\r\n**Dex** +3\r\n\r\n**Con** +1\r\n\r\n**Int** +2\r\n\r\n**Wis** +1\r\n\r\n**Cha** +4\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n[cold iron](/Equipment.aspx?ID=375) [sickle](/Weapons.aspx?ID=9), [_wand of magic missile_](/Spells.aspx?ID=180)\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 20 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +9 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +11 \r\n\r\n**Will** +11 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 65\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 25 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nsickle ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179), [Trip](/Traits.aspx?ID=196)),\r\n**Damage** 1d4+2 slashing\r\n\r\n**Occult Spontaneous Spells** DC 20, attack +12\r\n- **Cantrips (2nd)**\r\n[Daze](/Spells.aspx?ID=61), [Light](/Spells.aspx?ID=171), [Message](/Spells.aspx?ID=190), [Shield](/Spells.aspx?ID=280), [Telekinetic Projectile](/Spells.aspx?ID=334)\r\n- **1st**\r\n[Fear](/Spells.aspx?ID=110), [Illusory Object](/Spells.aspx?ID=160), [Mage Armor](/Spells.aspx?ID=176) (already cast), [True Strike](/Spells.aspx?ID=345)\r\n- **2nd**\r\n[Invisibility](/Spells.aspx?ID=164), [Mirror Image](/Spells.aspx?ID=197), [Phantom Pain](/Spells.aspx?ID=220)\r\n\r\n**Occult Focus Spells** DC 20, 2 Focus Points\r\n- **2nd**\r\n[Counter Performance](/Spells.aspx?ID=381), [Inspire Courage](/Spells.aspx?ID=386), [Loremaster's Etude](/Spells.aspx?ID=390)\r\n\r\n**[Change Shape](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=8)**  ([Concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32), [Occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120), [Polymorph](/Traits.aspx?ID=127), [transmutation **Frequency** once per week](/Traits.aspx?ID=157)) **Effect** By performing a ten-minute long incantation, Tartuccio takes on the appearance of any uniquely-appearing Small [humanoid](/Traits.aspx?ID=91).
