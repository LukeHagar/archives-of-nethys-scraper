Their hunger places them firmly at odds with scholars and historians alike. Living victims lose memories; written texts become blank books. Loreavors' favorite sites are ruins and ancient libraries, but they can also survive on banal secrets of everyday life as well. While the creatures are secretive, typically staying out of sight and fleeing danger, they become aggressive when their favored food sources are threatened.\n\n A loreavor appears as a 3-foot-long, pale, wormlike creature with dozens of half-formed faces growing from its segmented body.
