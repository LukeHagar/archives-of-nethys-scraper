Kodama commonly appear in old Tian forests, especially old-growth forests far removed from civilization. In the Forest of Spirits in Minkai, for example, so many trees are possessed by kodama that a traveler might pass by hundreds, if not thousands, of these beings while journeying through a single acre of woodland.\n\n Kodama try their utmost to protect their sacred trees, but a single kodama is a minor obstacle to most [oni](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=144) or others who have no qualms about desecrating forests or harvesting them for natural resources. Like trees in a forest, kodama are most powerful in great numbers and among other kami, whom they can bolster with their magical straw ropes while distracting strong enemies with their mesmerizing presence.\n\n On the other hand, kodama bear no ill will toward those who respect their wards, even allowing [druids](/Classes.aspx?ID=6) and other deferential creatures to dwell within their bounds. They might even subtly guide lost travelers out of the forest or back to safety.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Spirit](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11)): DC 20\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 18\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 15\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Kami_Kodama.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 5\">[Kodama](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1202)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"NG\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Small\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Kami\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=354\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Spirit\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=149\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 3](/Sources.aspx?ID=66) pg. 143</row>\n\n**Perception** +16; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1); [_speak with plants_](/Spells.aspx?ID=294), [telepathy](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=37) 50 feet\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +11, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +11, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +14, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +13, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +14\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +2\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +5\r\n\r\n**Int** +0\r\n\r\n**Wis** +5\r\n\r\n**Cha** +4\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Ward** ([abjuration](/Traits.aspx?ID=2), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48)) Every kami is bound to a ward: a specific animal, plant, object, or location.

A kami who wears a _spiritual rope_ gains resistance 5 to evil damage (though this is usually relevant only if the kami is good-aligned), a +1 status bonus to AC against evil creatures, and a +1 status bonus to saving throws against effects from evil creatures.<br /> A kodama always wears a _spiritual rope_, and they can have one other _spiritual rope_ in existence at a time.
