It sports a draconic tail, deadly fangs, and milky eyes. The Sandpoint Devil haunts the town of Sandpoint and its surrounding hinterlands, ever elusive and yet popping up repeatedly to terrorize the locals, earning it a reputation as a living legend. Though many children who grow up in Sandpoint believe the devil to be just a story, the people of Sandpoint each have their own anecdotes of sightings or direct encounters, and over the years, one thing became clear: the Sandpoint Devil is a very real threat.\n\n The Sandpoint Devil's stat block is featured on page 230 of _Pathfinder Bestiary 2_, and you can use that stat block to create an epic encounter between Sandpoint's mysterious monster and the PCs. In the end, this clash will likely result in the Sandpoint Devil's defeat and death at the PCs' hands, possibly after a difficult battle, depending on the PCs' level.\n\n However, evil as legendary as the Sandpoint Devil doesn't simply vanish when the creature is slain. As a fiend, the Sandpoint Devil's body is forged of raw spiritual essence connected to evil, malice, and hate— fertile ground for the corrupting touch of undeath, as negative energy intermingles with its dying spirit. Once the Sandpoint Devil is defeated, perhaps by your PCs or another group of adventurers, a unique spectral undead is quite likely to rise from its remains to carry on its legacy. Unbound from its physical body, the Sandpoint Devil becomes something else that is even more powerful, a being that comes to be known as the Spectral Devil.\n\n One option is to use the Spectral Devil as a sitebound spirit, doomed to forever haunt the Pit where the Sandpoint Devil once made its home, where it twists and changes the area into a haunted death trap from which few adventurers could escape. Alternatively, the Spectral Devil might not be bound to the Pit at all—it could become a roaming menace that stalks the region's moors or ambushes travelers on road or river. A group of adventurers who defeat the Sandpoint Devil could find their accomplishments called into doubt when the devil's torments on the region only increase in number, scope, and area in the wake of its reported death.\n\n The following statistics present an undead, spectral version of the Sandpoint Devil for use against PCs who think that their first fight against this local legend was their last. It's important to gauge your PCs before deciding to use the Spectral Devil in your campaign. While many groups are likely to enjoy the twist and callback to their old foe as it returns from the grave, for some groups, this kind of plot element can detract from their sense of accomplishment or make it feel like what they've done was ultimately meaningless. Use the Spectral Devil in the way that's right for your group.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Fiend](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 37\r\n\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Spirit](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11)): DC 37\r\n\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Undead](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 37\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 35\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 32\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/SpectralDevil.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 10\">[Spectral Devil](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1736)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Unique\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=161\" />\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fiend\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=70\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Incorporeal\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=222\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Spirit\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=149\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Undead\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=160\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Monsters of Myth](/Sources.aspx?ID=107) pg. 82</row>\n\n**Perception** +19; [greater darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), [scent](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=33) (imprecise) 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Abyssal](/Languages.aspx?ID=12), [Varisian](/Languages.aspx?ID=44)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +22, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +23, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +22, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +19\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** -5\r\n\r\n**Dex** +7\r\n\r\n**Con** +5\r\n\r\n**Int** +0\r\n\r\n**Wis** +4\r\n\r\n**Cha** +3\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 28 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +22 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +19 \r\n\r\n**Will** +16 \r\n\r\n+1 status to all saves vs. magic\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 140\r\n([negative healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=42))\n\n**Immunities**\r\n[disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), [fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=68), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126), precision, [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38)\r\n\r\n**Resistances**\r\nall damage 10 (except [cold iron](/Equipment.aspx?ID=375), [force](/Traits.aspx?ID=75), [_ghost touch_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=297), or [positive^](/Traits.aspx?ID=128) double resistance vs. non-[magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103))\n\n**Rejuvenation** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) Destroying the Spectral Devil releases its pure, evil essence into the world, where it can find a new body and re-form.
