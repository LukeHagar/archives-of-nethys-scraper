He tricked his people's priests into to imparting eldritch truths they would not normally share, then shared them with a few fellow secretive scholars of the occult.\n\n Gathering those whom Foras could manipulate, he retreated to a new stronghold—a location now known as Candlemere. Here, Foras's cult gave up their sight and their souls, only to become trapped with him within their own compound when their leader's brother tracked them down and imprisoned them. Yet even this hasn't stymied Foras, and he continues to this day to work toward his goal of drawing [Yog-Sothoth](/Deities.aspx?ID=166) into the world.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 49\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 47\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 44\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Foras.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 19\">[Foras](/NPCs.aspx?ID=2191)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Unique\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=161\" />\r\n<trait label=\"CE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Human\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=90\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Kingmaker Adventure Path](/Sources.aspx?ID=150) pg. 595</row>\n\n**Perception** +33; unseen sight\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Aklo](/Languages.aspx?ID=13), [Hallit](/Languages.aspx?ID=37)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +33, [Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2) +34, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +37, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +35, [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11) +37, [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13) +33, [YogSothoth Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +37\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +0\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +2\r\n\r\n**Int** +5\r\n\r\n**Wis** +4\r\n\r\n**Cha** +6\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Unseen Sight** This is a precise sense that mimics [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12) yet functions even if the eye sockets themselves are covered.
