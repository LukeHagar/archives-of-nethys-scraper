Yet when Urok cracked open his shell, his caretakers were shocked to see the kobold hatchling had unique gold and silver scales, unlike even the scales of a metallic kobold. Though his soul was unclaimed by the forces of evil, Urok grew up arrogant and overbearing, enforcing the strict order that the devil imposed on his tribe. He was quick to realize that his fellows weren't carrying out their tasks as efficiently as they could be, and his efforts to organize his tribe more effectively always seemed to fail. It was only after investigating that he realized how much the Yioxats were deliberately undermining his efforts, as they despised their devil overlord, and despised Urok by association.\n\n  Though he was heavily tempted to double down on his attempts to control, Urok instead fled, hiding in the wilderness as he tried to make sense of his life until this point. It was there that a Yioxat dragon sorcerer found him. The sorcerer explained that the Yioxat tribe had warded Urok's egg against evil influence before he was born, to protect him from the risk of Hell claiming his soul. Realizing that he had repaid his people's kindness with oppression, Urok decided to serve the law by returning sovereignty to his tribe. Though he doesn't want to approach his fellows just yet, he keeps watch over them, looking for an opportunity to kill the devil and free his family. However, this has also resulted in Urok clashing with well-meaning adventurers who seek to destroy the Yioxat tribe without realizing the kobolds are unwilling servants.\n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Plot Hooks</title>Game Masters may consider the following plot hooks as a means of integrating Urok into any Pathfinder Second Edition game.\n<ul><li>Urok arrives in the same town as the heroes.
