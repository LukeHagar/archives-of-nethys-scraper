Most shrine skelms insinuate themselves into positions of judgment in powerful religious groups to gain that power for their own use and abuse. Shrine skelms wear the old-fashioned, traditional apparel of whatever faith they've infiltrated, brandishing religious symbols made of precious metals to better blend in and give an impression of age and power.\n\n No matter what religion they infiltrate, a shrine skelm is a master at taking established teachings out of context to justify elaborate, painful, and often humiliating punishments for his victims. He usually targets people with the audacity to question his position or teachings, but also relentlessly harasses anyone he envies.\n\n Shrine skelms are skilled listeners, especially in settings like group prayers where they can learn worshippers' fears or hopes. They exploit whatever information they learn for their own prestige and power, but they also watch for jealousy and the seeds of rage that could be nurtured to make a new skelm. They can even intercept sincere prayers and steal their effects for themselves, and they command several spells to manipulate and control their unwitting, vulnerable victims.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 20\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 18\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 15\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Skelm_ShrineSkelm.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 5\">[Shrine Skelm](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1302)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"LE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Skelm\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=364\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 3](/Sources.aspx?ID=66) pg. 239</row>\n\n**Perception** +11; [scent](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=33) (imprecise) 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Aklo](/Languages.aspx?ID=13), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1); [telepathy](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=37) 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +12, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +14, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +14, [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11) +11, [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13) +11, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +12, [Thievery](/Skills.aspx?ID=17) +12\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +5\r\n\r\n**Dex** +3\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** +4\r\n\r\n**Wis** +2\r\n\r\n**Cha** +5\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n[silver](/Equipment.aspx?ID=277) [religious symbol](/Equipment.aspx?ID=41)\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 22 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +13 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +12 \r\n\r\n**Will** +11 \r\n\r\n–1 to all saves vs. [emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60) effects\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 80\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\n[cold iron](/Equipment.aspx?ID=375) 5\r\n\r\n**Seize Prayer** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> ([abjuration](/Traits.aspx?ID=2), [concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32), [occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120)) **Trigger** A creature the shrine skelm can hear within 30 feet Casts a [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48) Spell with a verbal component; **Effect** The shrine skelm utters an incantation and attempts to [counteract](/Rules.aspx?ID=371) the triggering spell (counteract modifier +14, counteract level 3rd).
