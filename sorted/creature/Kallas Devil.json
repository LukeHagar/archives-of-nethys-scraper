Though her wicked trident and violent fury are enough to sear her image into the minds of the local people, it's the Kallas Devil's ability to slip unseen among her would-be victims that elevates the creature beyond the ranks of a common horror. No matter how careful the residents of Riverton are with their youth and the vulnerable, the Kallas Devil claims her chosen target more often than not, luring the hapless victim toward doom while wearing a smiling child's face.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 36\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 34\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 31\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/KallasDevil.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 9\">[Kallas Devil](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1729)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Unique\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=161\" />\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Amphibious\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=207\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Hag\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=84\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Monsters of Myth](/Sources.aspx?ID=107) pg. 46</row>\n\n**Perception** +21; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), [lifesense](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=21) (imprecise) 30 feet, [wavesense](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=41) (imprecise) 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Aklo](/Languages.aspx?ID=13), [Aquan](/Languages.aspx?ID=14), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Hallit](/Languages.aspx?ID=37)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +18, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +18, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +18, [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11) +20, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +16\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +4\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +3\r\n\r\n**Int** +6\r\n\r\n**Wis** +5\r\n\r\n**Cha** +5\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**[Coven](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=11)** The Kallas Devil adds [_dominate_](/Spells.aspx?ID=87), [_false vision_](/Spells.aspx?ID=109), [_invisibility_](/Spells.aspx?ID=164), and [_subconscious suggestion_](/Spells.aspx?ID=314) to her coven's spells.<br />**Leatherwork** Once a month, the Kallas Devil can spend 1 day stitching the skin of a person into her coat.

A GM can add two of these abilities and apply the [elite](/Rules.aspx?ID=790) adjustment to create a more powerful version of the Kallas Devil, perhaps one that has been empowered by a killing spree.\n\n **Blameless** While in disguise, the Kallas Devil can attempt to keep others from noticing her Loathsome Stench by attempting a [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) check to [Lie](/Actions.aspx?ID=47). She has a +4 circumstance bonus to this check.\n\n **Infectious Water** The Kallas Devil has a vengeful streak and has the ability to infect wells and water supplies in Riverton with [sewer haze](/Diseases.aspx?ID=11). She can infect the water supply 1d6 days after the Festival of the Skinned Hooves if the ritual sacrifice of the festival isn't performed.\n\n **Underwater Views** While underwater, the Kallas Devil can blend in with the surrounding environment and hide from other creatures by attempting a [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) check.

When the Kallas Devil makes a jaws or claw attack, she deals an additional 1d6 [cold](/Traits.aspx?ID=27) damage.\n\n **Waterfall Torrent** The Kallas Devil controls any water she touches.
