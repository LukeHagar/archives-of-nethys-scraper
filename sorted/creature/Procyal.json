They use this ability only for the greater good of that humanoid or their community, often appearing as someone's trusted mentor to deliver an important message in a more laid-back fashion than talking to a magical celestial raccoon. They're not above playing the occasional harmless prank on the person whose form they've assumed, especially when they can use it to teach a valuable lesson.
