These ancient monoliths hold the memories of their vast territories, keeping mental records of the passing seasons of the world around them. Their knowledge of humanoid affairs varies, as they find quickly shifting political situations difficult to comprehend, but through fungal networks, reports from [arboreal wardens](/Monsters.aspx?ID=27), and other woodland chatter, arboreal archives learn of each storm, drought, or logging threat encountered throughout their long years. They primarily observe and record rather than interfere, but they willingly offer wisdom to those who respectfully seek them out. [Arboreal regents](/Monsters.aspx?ID=29) call upon archives for advice in times of strife, conferring on the best course of action to protect their realms.\n\n It is rare for there to be more than one arboreal archive in a given region. When an archive senses they're nearing the end of their lengthy lifespan, a grove of regents gathers to nominate the wisest among them to become the next archive. After four seasons' deliberation, all arboreals in the area congregate to witness the succession ritual, during which the elder arboreal archive transfers their collected wisdom to the elected replacement before retiring.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Plant](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 30\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 28\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 25\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Arboreal_ArborealArchive.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 12\">[Arboreal Archive](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1068)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"NG\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Huge\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Plant\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=125\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 3](/Sources.aspx?ID=66) pg. 21</row>\n\n**Perception** +25; [low-light vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=23), [tremorsense](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=40) (imprecise) 60 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Arboreal](/Languages.aspx?ID=26), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Sylvan](/Languages.aspx?ID=10); [_speak with plants_](/Spells.aspx?ID=294)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +23, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +22, [Forest Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +28, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +25, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +19\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +7\r\n\r\n**Dex** -1\r\n\r\n**Con** +5\r\n\r\n**Int** +4\r\n\r\n**Wis** +7\r\n\r\n**Cha** +4\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 33 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +23 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +17 \r\n\r\n**Will** +27 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 230\n\n**Resistances**\r\nbludgeoning 10, piercing 10\r\n\r\n**Weaknesses**\r\naxe vulnerability, fire 15\r\n\r\n**Axe Vulnerability** An arboreal archive takes 10 additional damage from [axes](/WeaponGroups.aspx?ID=1).<br />**Abeyance Rift** If an arboreal archive dies unexpectedly before passing on their knowledge in a succession ritual, the amassed lore within their roots and boughs explodes out in a shock wave that deals 8d10 mental damage to creatures within 30 feet (DC 32 basic Will save) before dissipating; those who fail also fall [prone](/Conditions.aspx?ID=31).\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 25 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nbranch +25 ([reach 15 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 3d10+10 bludgeoning plus [Improved Knockdown](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=28)\r\n\r\n**Primal Innate Spells** DC 32, attack +24\r\n- **2nd**\r\n[Entangle](/Spells.aspx?ID=103)\r\n- **3rd**\r\n[Earthbind](/Spells.aspx?ID=94) (at will)\r\n- **6th**\r\n[Tangling Creepers](/Spells.aspx?ID=331)\r\n- **Constant (4th)**\r\n[Speak with Plants](/Spells.aspx?ID=294)\r\n\r\n**Memory Maelstrom** <actions string=\"Three Actions\" /> ([Concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32), [Incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=93), [Mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [Nonlethal](/Traits.aspx?ID=188), [Primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=134)) The arboreal archive tries to overwhelm foes with a surge of information it has absorbed over its long life.
