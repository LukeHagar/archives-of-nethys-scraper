Cunning and patient ambush predators, ropers use this to their advantage.\n\n Ropers do not form large societies (although they can often be found living alongside other deep-dwelling denizens), but they often congregate in small clusters and sometimes hunt in groups. Particularly interested in the philosophy of life and death and the flner points of the more cruel and sinister religions of the world, a roper can talk or argue for hours with those it initially sought merely to eat. Quick-thinking spelunkers can sometimes stave off a roper’s appetite by entertaining it with stories or discussions of philosophy, but ropers do not willingly allow such intriguing prey to escape alive. Stories speak of particularly skilled debaters and philosophers who have been kept for days or even years as pets or conversational companions by roper clusters, but in the end, if such pets don’t eventually escape, the ropers’ appetites win out over their intellectual curiosity—especially in cases where the pets constantly outmaneuver their keepers’ wits and patience. A roper is 9 feet tall and weighs 2,200 pounds.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Aberration](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11)): DC 29\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 27\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 24\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Roper.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 10\">[Roper](/Monsters.aspx?ID=353)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"CE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Aberration\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=1\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 282</row>\n\n**Perception** +21; darkvision\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Aklo](/Languages.aspx?ID=13), [Undercommon](/Languages.aspx?ID=11)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +22, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +17, [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13) +19, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +17\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +6\r\n\r\n**Dex** +1\r\n\r\n**Con** +6\r\n\r\n**Int** +1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** +1\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 29 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +20 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +15 \r\n\r\n**Will** +21 \r\n\r\n+2 status to all saves vs. magic\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 215\n\n**Resistances**\r\nelectricity 10\r\n\r\n**Weaknesses**\r\nfire 10\r\n\r\n**Reactive Lash** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> **Trigger** A creature within reach of the roper’s strand leaves a square during a move action it’s using. **Effect** The roper makes a strand Strike against the triggering creature.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 10 feet, climb 10 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njaws +21,\r\n**Damage** 2d12+12 piercing\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nstrand +23 ([reach 50 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** sticky strand\n\n**Extend Strands** <actions string=\"Single Action\" />  The roper extends or retracts six thin, sticky tendrils from its body.

The roper rolls a single [Athletics](/Conditions.aspx?ID=3) check and compares the result to each immobilized creature’s Fortitude DC. The roper pulls each creature it succeeds against up to 25 feet closer and each creature it critically succeeds against up to 50 feet closer.\r\n\r\n**Sticky Strand**   Any creature hit by a roper’s strand is [enfeebled 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=13) and [grabbed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=20). Each additional hit from a strand increases the enfeebled condition value by 1 (to a maximum of [enfeebled 4](/Conditions.aspx?ID=13)). This enfeebled value decreases by 1 every 8 hours. The roper can move while it has a creature grabbed with a strand, but it automatically releases the creature if it moves beyond the strand’s reach. The roper can release an grabbed creature as a free action. A creature can sever a strand with a target attack that hits AC 27 and deals at least 18 slashing damage. This doesn’t deal any damage to the roper itself, though it can no longer attack with a severed strand.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_5_TreasureAndRewards.png\">Roper Treasure</title>\r\n\r\nA roper keeps treasure from its past victims, often enjoying the items as mementos of prior conversations or delicious flavors.
