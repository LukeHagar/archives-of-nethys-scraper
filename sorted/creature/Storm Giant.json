Storm giants tend to rapidly shift in mood and behavior, one moment engaging in peaceful negotiation, the next unleashing unbridled ferocity against their foes. In this way, they embody both the fury of a raging tempest and the calm of a hurricane’s eye. This can make them valuable allies who race to the aid of those in need, but their allies remain must be alert and mindful of their mood, as the giants can be quick to anger or aggressive when caution is most appropriate.\n\n Most storm giants have complexions akin to the crystal blue of the ocean or the warm violet of a sky touched by the setting sun. Their hair tends to be dark purple, blue, or black, and their eyes often have a silvery sheen. A typical storm giant stands 21 feet tall, weighs 12,000 pounds, and lives to be about 600 years old.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 31\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 29\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 26\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Giant_StormGiant.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 13\">[Storm Giant](/Monsters.aspx?ID=225)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"CG\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Huge\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Amphibious\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=207\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Giant\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=79\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 174</row>\n\n**Perception** +24; low-light vision\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Auran](/Languages.aspx?ID=15), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Draconic](/Languages.aspx?ID=2), [Jotun](/Languages.aspx?ID=8)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +20, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +27, [Crafting](/Skills.aspx?ID=4) +24, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +24, [Performance](/Skills.aspx?ID=12) +22\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +8\r\n\r\n**Dex** +1\r\n\r\n**Con** +6\r\n\r\n**Int** +3\r\n\r\n**Wis** +5\r\n\r\n**Cha** +2\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n_+1 [striking](/Equipment.aspx?ID=280) [greatsword](/Weapons.aspx?ID=24)_, [sack with 5 rocks](/Equipment.aspx?ID=45)\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 34 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +28 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +21 \r\n\r\n**Will** +23 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 235\n\n**Immunities**\r\nelectricity\n\n**Catch Rock** <actions string=\"Reaction\" />\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 35 feet, swim 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\n_greatsword_ +28 ([Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [reach 15 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192), [versatile P](/Traits.aspx?ID=200)),\r\n**Damage** 2d12+16 slashing plus 1d6 electricity\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nfist +27 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [reach 15 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 2d8+16 bludgeoning plus 1d6 electricity\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nrock +37 ([Brutal](/Traits.aspx?ID=249), [range increment 120 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=248)),\r\n**Damage** 2d10+16 bludgeoning\r\n\r\n**Arcane Innate Spells** DC 33\r\n- **3rd**\r\n[Levitate](/Spells.aspx?ID=170) (at will)\r\n- **6th**\r\n[Chain Lightning](/Spells.aspx?ID=33) (x3)\r\n- **Constant (4th)**\r\n[Freedom of Movement](/Spells.aspx?ID=128)\r\n- **5th**\r\n[Control Weather](/Rituals.aspx?ID=9) (at will)\r\n\r\n**Lightning Blade** <actions string=\"Three Actions\" /> ([Electricity](/Traits.aspx?ID=56), [Evocation](/Traits.aspx?ID=65), [Primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=134)) The storm giant raises one hand to the sky, channeling a bolt of lightning into the blade held in the other.
