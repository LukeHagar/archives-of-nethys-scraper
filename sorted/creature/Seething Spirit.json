Single-minded in nature, they stoke the fires of anger and hate, capable of planning and strategy, but the one thing beyond their grasp is personal growth. Though similar to [ghosts](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=51), seething spirits retain much less of their former living selves. Most of their soul has moved on, and only the fury remains. There's no way to set a seething spirit to rest: only violence can destroy it.\n\n By possessing a creature and nurturing the seeds of resentment and rage already within its mind, a seething spirit can greatly alter the host's behavior and personality. When broached about such changes, a host might claim they're just finally “telling it like it is.” Because a seething spirit can't voluntarily end its possession, it's essentially one with its victim until the victim's rage results in death. A seething spirit doesn't take pleasure in this death—they rapidly move on in search of a new rageful host.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Spirit](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11)): DC 30\r\n\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Undead](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 30\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 28\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 25\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/SeethingSpirit.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 11\">[Seething Spirit](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1290)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"CE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Incorporeal\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=222\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Spirit\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=149\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Undead\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=160\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 3](/Sources.aspx?ID=66) pg. 228</row>\n\n**Perception** +15; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), tastes anger (imprecise) 1 mile\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Dwarven](/Languages.aspx?ID=3), [Jotun](/Languages.aspx?ID=8); [_tongues_](/Spells.aspx?ID=340)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +21, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +20, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) -5, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +24, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +21\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** -5\r\n\r\n**Dex** +6\r\n\r\n**Con** +0\r\n\r\n**Int** +2\r\n\r\n**Wis** -2\r\n\r\n**Cha** +7\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Taste Anger** ([detection](/Traits.aspx?ID=43), [divination](/Traits.aspx?ID=47), [occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120)) The spirit can taste anger and hatred from creatures experiencing those emotions within 1 mile (imprecise).\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 29 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +17 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +23 \r\n\r\n**Will** +21 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 145\r\n([negative healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=42))\n\n**Immunities**\r\n[death](/Traits.aspx?ID=40) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126), precision, [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38)\r\n\r\n**Resistances**\r\nall damage 10 (except emotion, [force](/Traits.aspx?ID=75), [_ghost touch_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=297), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), or [positive](/Traits.aspx?ID=128); double resistance vs. non-[magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103))\r\n\r\n**Weaknesses**\r\nemotion 12\r\n\r\n**Pulse of Rage** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120)) 20 feet.
