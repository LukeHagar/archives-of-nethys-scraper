When he heard Lady Jamandi was looking for volunteers to aid her in exploring and taming the Stolen Lands, he saw an opportunity to bolster his fame. In the months since, Hannis has come to regret his decision, and now that he has been forced to surrender to [Irovetti](/NPCs.aspx?ID=2189) and [Armag](/NPCs.aspx?ID=2188), his attitude has shifted from frustration to outright cruelty. Drelev comes across as a sullen, greedy, conceited man, never satisfied with his lot in life, but always disdainful of anyone who has less than him. Though skilled at politics, the baron fancies himself a skilled swordsman as well. He loves dueling and often spars against his own guardsmen and senior officers. He likes to show off, taunting and belittling those he overpowers, but reacts angrily to situations where others get the best of him.\n\n A patient opponent who prides himself on his ability to skillfully outmaneuver his foes, Baron Drelev begins nearly every turn with Defensive Slice. He favors disarming foes, and attempts to do so once per round when facing an armed foe, mocking them wickedly if he's successful and cursing them violently if not.\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 40\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 38\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 35\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/HannisDrelev.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 12\">[Hannis Drelev](/NPCs.aspx?ID=2193)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Unique\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=161\" />\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Human\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=90\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Kingmaker Adventure Path](/Sources.aspx?ID=150) pg. 597</row>\n\n**Perception** +17\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Skald](/Languages.aspx?ID=42)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +22, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +23, [Brevoy Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +19, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +24, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +24, [Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14) +19, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +22, [Thievery](/Skills.aspx?ID=17) +20\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +5\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +3\r\n\r\n**Int** +1\r\n\r\n**Wis** -1\r\n\r\n**Cha** +4\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n_+1 [resilient](/Equipment.aspx?ID=279) [breastplate](/Armor.aspx?ID=10)_, [Crossbow](/Weapons.aspx?ID=67) (10 bolts), _+1 [grievous](/Equipment.aspx?ID=298) [striking](/Equipment.aspx?ID=280) [longsword](/Weapons.aspx?ID=31)_, [Hatchet](/Weapons.aspx?ID=27), key ring, [_moderate healing potions_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=186) (3)\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 33 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +23 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +25 \r\n\r\n**Will** +18 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 220\n\n**[Attack of Opportunity](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=3)** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> \r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 25 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\n_longsword_ +26 ([Disarm](/Traits.aspx?ID=175), [versatile P](/Traits.aspx?ID=200)),\r\n**Damage** 2d8+11 slashing\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nhatchet +25 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Sweep](/Traits.aspx?ID=194)),\r\n**Damage** 1d6+11 slashing\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\ncrossbow+23 ([range 120 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=248), [reload 1](/Traits.aspx?ID=254)),\r\n**Damage** 1d8+6 piercing\n\n**Defensive Slice** <actions string=\"Single Action\" />  **Requirement** Baron Drelev hasn't attempted a Strike during this turn. **Effect** Baron Drelev assumes a defensive position with his weapons out, then attempts a melee Strike.
