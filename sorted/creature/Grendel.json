Where there is peace and prosperity in the world, Grendel strikes, eager to prove that tranquility is transitory and death is the only constant. He stalks the edge of his fens, seeking settlements where joy holds sway. He strikes under cover of night, primarily targeting celebrations or festivals. The more happiness or joy he can extinguish, the better.\n\n Although Grendel is a unique creature, killing him won't save the world from his ravages for long. Once Grendel's mother instinctively feels the pain of her violent son's death, she soon births a replacement. The new Grendel seems to avoid the sites his elder brothers terrorized, as if he instinctively knows that such a place hosts heroes powerful enough to defeat him.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 49\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 47\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 44\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Grendel.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 19\">[Grendel](/Monsters.aspx?ID=690)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Unique\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=161\" />\r\n<trait label=\"CE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 136 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +35; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), keen hearing 120 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +34, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +39, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +34, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +34, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +33\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +10\r\n\r\n**Dex** +5\r\n\r\n**Con** +7\r\n\r\n**Int** +0\r\n\r\n**Wis** +6\r\n\r\n**Cha** +5\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Keen Hearing** Grendel's hearing is a precise sense to a range of 120 feet.\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 44 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +36 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +32 \r\n\r\n**Will** +31 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 360\n\n**Resistances**\r\nall 15 (except unarmed attacks)\n\n**[Frightful Presence](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=17)** (aura, emotion, fear, mental) 60 feet, DC 38.<br />**[Attack of Opportunity](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=3)** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> Grendel gains an extra reaction at the start of each of his turns that he can use only to make an Attack of Opportunity with his claw.
