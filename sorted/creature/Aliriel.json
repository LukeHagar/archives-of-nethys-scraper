It can take [move](/Traits.aspx?ID=114) actions to move toward its coffin even though it's at 0 HP. While at 0 HP in this form, the strigoi is unaffected by further damage. Once the strigoi reaches its coffin, or if it hasn't done so within 2 hours, it automatically returns to its physical form, [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38).<br />**Strigoi Weaknesses** All strigoi possess the following weaknesses:\n<ul><li>**Revulsion** Strigoi are uncomfortable near mirrors or sources of bright light. Only a strigoi's shadow reflects in a mirror, and this often compels them to cover or destroy mirrors in their presence rather than risk their true nature being displayed. A strigoi can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or source of bright light. To brandish a mirror or light source, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to [Raising a Shield](/Actions.aspx?ID=98)). If the strigoi involuntarily comes within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or light source, it gains the [fleeing](/Conditions.aspx?ID=17) condition, running from the brandished object until it ends an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of its revulsion, a strigoi can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the [concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32) trait. On a success, it overcomes its revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success). A strigoi can move normally around mirrors or bright light sources that are not brandished, although doing so causes them discomfort that can be noticed with a successful Perception check to [Sense Motive](/Actions.aspx?ID=85).</li><li>**Sunlight** When exposed to direct sunlight, a strigoi immediately becomes unconscious and falls to the ground. It appears to be dead: it doesn't breathe, its body temperature matches its surroundings, and it doesn't react to pain or other stimuli. A successful Perception check against the strigoi's Reflex DC is enough to note one anomaly: the shadow cast by its “dead” body shifts and moves slightly, its edges twisting and active. Spells like [_detect evil_](/Spells.aspx?ID=65), senses like [lifesense](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=21), and the “corpse” taking damage from [positive](/Traits.aspx?ID=128) energy still function normally, and could reveal the truth without needing a successful Perception check. Viewing the “corpse” in a mirror's reflection can also reveal the truth, for only the body's shadow reflects. While in sunlight and unconscious, the strigoi loses its resistance to physical damage. If the strigoi takes enough damage that it would be reduced to 0 Hit Points, its body quickly decomposes, and the strigoi is destroyed.</li><li>**Water Revulsion** A strigoi cannot cross a significant source of running water (such as a creek, river, or waves on a seashore). A strigoi capable of flight can cross running water provided it approaches no closer than 10 feet to the liquid's surface. If forced into running water against its will, the strigoi becomes [slowed 2](/Conditions.aspx?ID=35) and gains the [fleeing](/Conditions.aspx?ID=17) condition as long as it remains in the water. At the end of any turn in which the strigoi remains in running water, it must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or be destroyed.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 25 feet, fly 25 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nclaw +29 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170)),\r\n**Damage** 3d10+12 slashing plus [Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=18)\r\n\r\n**Wizard Spells Prepared** DC 36, attack +28\r\n- **Cantrips (8th)**\r\n[Chill Touch](/Spells.aspx?ID=35), [Detect Magic](/Spells.aspx?ID=66), [Electric Arc](/Spells.aspx?ID=97), [Mage Hand](/Spells.aspx?ID=177), [Prestidigitation](/Spells.aspx?ID=229)\r\n- **1st**\r\n[Ray of Enfeeblement](/Spells.aspx?ID=244) (×2), [True Strike](/Spells.aspx?ID=345)\r\n- **2nd**\r\n[Deafness](/Spells.aspx?ID=62), [Mirror Image](/Spells.aspx?ID=197), [Spectral Hand](/Spells.aspx?ID=295)\r\n- **3rd**\r\n[Blindness](/Spells.aspx?ID=26), [Mind Reading](/Spells.aspx?ID=194), [Slow](/Spells.aspx?ID=289) (×2)\r\n- **4th**\r\n[Dimension Door](/Spells.aspx?ID=69) (×2), [Grim Tendrils](/Spells.aspx?ID=141) (×2), [Nightmare](/Spells.aspx?ID=208)\r\n- **5th**\r\n[Cloudkill](/Spells.aspx?ID=42), [Mind Probe](/Spells.aspx?ID=193), [Sending](/Spells.aspx?ID=272), [Shadow Walk](/Spells.aspx?ID=275)\r\n- **6th**\r\n[Baleful Polymorph](/Spells.aspx?ID=17), [Vampiric Exsanguination](/Spells.aspx?ID=353), [Wall of Force](/Spells.aspx?ID=363)\r\n- **7th**\r\n[Dispel Magic](/Spells.aspx?ID=78), [Eclipse Burst](/Spells.aspx?ID=96), [Magic Missile](/Spells.aspx?ID=180)\r\n- **8th**\r\n[Horrid Wilting](/Spells.aspx?ID=152), [Maze](/Spells.aspx?ID=187)\r\n\r\n**Wizard School Spells** DC 36, 3 Focus Points\r\n- **8th**\r\n[Call of the Grave](/Spells.aspx?ID=522), [Overstuff](/Spells.aspx?ID=436), [Take its Course](/Spells.aspx?ID=456)\r\n\r\n**Rituals** DC 33\r\n\r\n- **2nd**\r\n[Create Undead](/Rituals.aspx?ID=10)\r\n- **5th**\r\n[Call Spirit](/Rituals.aspx?ID=5)\r\n- **6th**\r\n[Planar Binding](/Rituals.aspx?ID=17)\r\n\r\n**Create Spawn**  ([Divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [Downtime](/Traits.aspx?ID=49), [Necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) If a creature dies after being reduced to 0 HP by Domain of Dusk or Drink Essence, the strigoi can turn this victim into a vampire by donating some of its own blood to the victim and burying the victim in earth for 3 nights. If the new vampire is lower level than its creator, it is under the creator's control. A victim that is 8th level or higher becomes a [strigoi servant](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1955), while a lower-level victim instead becomes a [moroi vampire](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=97). If a vampire controls too many spawn at once (as determined by the GM), strong-willed spawn can free themselves by succeeding at a Will saving throw against the vampire's Will DC.\r\n\r\n**Domain of Dusk** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([Conjuration](/Traits.aspx?ID=33), [Divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [Shadow](/Traits.aspx?ID=143)) With a wave of its hand, the strigoi calls fourth vile ruination from the surrounding shadows, causing coils of darkness and shadowy bats, rats, and wolves to lash out at living targets in a 30-foot emanation. Living creatures in this area take 8d6 negative damage(DC 34 [basic](/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Fortitude save). A creature that fails this save is also [dazzled](/Conditions.aspx?ID=7) for 1 round (or [blinded](/Conditions.aspx?ID=1) for 1 round and then dazzled for 1 round) by the darkness. The strigoi progenitor can't use Domain of Dusk for 1 minute.\r\n\r\n**Dominate** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([Divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [Enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61), [Incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=93), [Mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [Visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=163)) The vampire can cast [_dominate_](/Spells.aspx?ID=87) (DC 34) at will as a divine innate spell. Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the [visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=163) trait. A creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that vampire's Dominate for 24 hours. Fully destroying the vampire ends the domination, but merely reducing the vampire to 0 HP is insufficient to break the spell.\r\n\r\n**Drink Essence** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([Divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [Necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) **Requirements** A [grabbed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=20), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [restrained](/Conditions.aspx?ID=33), [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38), or willing creature is within the strigoi's reach; **Effect** The strigoi sinks their fangs into the targeted creature to drink its blood and draw out its vital essence. This requires an [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) check against the creature's Fortitude DC if the creature is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The creature becomes [drained 2](/Conditions.aspx?ID=10) and [stupefied 2](/Conditions.aspx?ID=37), and the strigoi regains 21 HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Essence from a creature that's already drained or stupefied doesn't restore any HP, but increases either the creature's drained condition value or its stupefied condition value by 1 (whichever value is lesser is increased; if both values are equal, then the strigoi chooses which condition to increase the value of).<br /> A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful DC 20 [Medicine](/Skills.aspx?ID=9) check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes.<br /> A victim's stupefied condition decreases by 1 per day after performing daily preparations. If the daily preparations are done in full sunlight, the stupefied condition is removed entirely.\r\n\r\n**Shadow Form** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([Concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32), [Divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [Transmutation](/Traits.aspx?ID=157), [Shadow](/Traits.aspx?ID=143)) The strigoi reverts to pure shadow and absorbs its body and its gear into the darkness, or it shifts back to its physical form. In shadow form, the strigoi gains a climb Speed equal to its land Speed and can move through any gap that isn't airtight. However, it can only move along solid surfaces that aren't highly reflective, not liquid or mirrored surfaces. If the surface it's on is destroyed, the strigoi returns to physical form and is [stunned 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=36). The strigoi loses fast healing while in shadow form but can remain in shadow form indefinitely.<br /> A strigoi that is exposed to sunlight while in shadow form becomes [slowed 2](/Conditions.aspx?ID=35) and must attempt a DC 16 flat check at the end of each of its turns. If it fails this flat check, it is destroyed, the shadow vanishing with a blood-curdling wail.\r\n\r\n**Thassilonian Necromancer**   Aliriel cannot cast [abjuration](/Traits.aspx?ID=2) or [enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61) spells.\r\n\r\n</column>",

Shadow Escape Free Action Trigger The strigoi is reduced to 0 HP; Effect The strigoi uses Shadow Form. It can take move actions to move toward its coffin even though it's at 0 HP. While at 0 HP in this form, the strigoi is unaffected by further damage. Once the strigoi reaches its coffin, or if it hasn't done so within 2 hours, it automatically returns to its physical form, unconscious. Strigoi Weaknesses All strigoi possess the following weaknesses: Revulsion Strigoi are uncomfortable near mirrors or sources of bright light. Only a strigoi's shadow reflects in a mirror, and this often compels them to cover or destroy mirrors in their presence rather than risk their true nature being displayed. A strigoi can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or source of bright light. To brandish a mirror or light source, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the strigoi involuntarily comes within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or light source, it gains the fleeing condition, running from the brandished object until it ends an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of its revulsion, a strigoi can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, it overcomes its revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success). A strigoi can move normally around mirrors or bright light sources that are not brandished, although doing so causes them discomfort that can be noticed with a successful Perception check to Sense Motive. Sunlight When exposed to direct sunlight, a strigoi immediately becomes unconscious and falls to the ground. It appears to be dead: it doesn't breathe, its body temperature matches its surroundings, and it doesn't react to pain or other stimuli. A successful Perception check against the strigoi's Reflex DC is enough to note one anomaly: the shadow cast by its “dead” body shifts and moves slightly, its edges twisting and active. Spells like detect evil , senses like lifesense, and the “corpse” taking damage from positive energy still function normally, and could reveal the truth without needing a successful Perception check. Viewing the “corpse” in a mirror's reflection can also reveal the truth, for only the body's shadow reflects. While in sunlight and unconscious, the strigoi loses its resistance to physical damage. If the strigoi takes enough damage that it would be reduced to 0 Hit Points, its body quickly decomposes, and the strigoi is destroyed. Water Revulsion A strigoi cannot cross a significant source of running water (such as a creek, river, or waves on a seashore). A strigoi capable of flight can cross running water provided it approaches no closer than 10 feet to the liquid's surface. If forced into running water against its will, the strigoi becomes slowed 2 and gains the fleeing condition as long as it remains in the water. At the end of any turn in which the strigoi remains in running water, it must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or be destroyed. --- Speed 25 feet, fly 25 feet Melee Single Action claw +29 (Agile), Damage 3d10+12 slashing plus Grab Wizard Spells Prepared DC 36, attack +28 - Cantrips (8th) Chill Touch, Detect Magic, Electric Arc, Mage Hand, Prestidigitation - 1st Ray of Enfeeblement (×2), True Strike - 2nd Deafness, Mirror Image, Spectral Hand - 3rd Blindness, Mind Reading, Slow (×2) - 4th Dimension Door (×2), Grim Tendrils (×2), Nightmare - 5th Cloudkill, Mind Probe, Sending, Shadow Walk - 6th Baleful Polymorph, Vampiric Exsanguination, Wall of Force - 7th Dispel Magic, Eclipse Burst, Magic Missile - 8th Horrid Wilting, Maze Wizard School Spells DC 36, 3 Focus Points - 8th Call of the Grave, Overstuff, Take its Course Rituals DC 33 - 2nd Create Undead - 5th Call Spirit - 6th Planar Binding Create Spawn (Divine, Downtime, Necromancy) If a creature dies after being reduced to 0 HP by Domain of Dusk or Drink Essence, the strigoi can turn this victim into a vampire by donating some of its own blood to the victim and burying the victim in earth for 3 nights.

Domain of Dusk Two Actions (Conjuration, Divine, Shadow) With a wave of its hand, the strigoi calls fourth vile ruination from the surrounding shadows, causing coils of darkness and shadowy bats, rats, and wolves to lash out at living targets in a 30-foot emanation. Living creatures in this area take 8d6 negative damage(DC 34 basic Fortitude save). A creature that fails this save is also dazzled for 1 round (or blinded for 1 round and then dazzled for 1 round) by the darkness. The strigoi progenitor can't use Domain of Dusk for 1 minute. Dominate Two Actions (Divine, Enchantment, Incapacitation, Mental, Visual) The vampire can cast dominate (DC 34) at will as a divine innate spell. Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the visual trait. A creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that vampire's Dominate for 24 hours. Fully destroying the vampire ends the domination, but merely reducing the vampire to 0 HP is insufficient to break the spell. Drink Essence Single Action (Divine, Necromancy) Requirements A grabbed, paralyzed, restrained, unconscious, or willing creature is within the strigoi's reach; Effect The strigoi sinks their fangs into the targeted creature to drink its blood and draw out its vital essence. This requires an Athletics check against the creature's Fortitude DC if the creature is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The creature becomes drained 2 and stupefied 2, and the strigoi regains 21 HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Essence from a creature that's already drained or stupefied doesn't restore any HP, but increases either the creature's drained condition value or its stupefied condition value by 1 (whichever value is lesser is increased; if both values are equal, then the strigoi chooses which condition to increase the value of). A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes. A victim's stupefied condition decreases by 1 per day after performing daily preparations. If the daily preparations are done in full sunlight, the stupefied condition is removed entirely. Shadow Form Single Action (Concentrate, Divine, Transmutation, Shadow) The strigoi reverts to pure shadow and absorbs its body and its gear into the darkness, or it shifts back to its physical form. In shadow form, the strigoi gains a climb Speed equal to its land Speed and can move through any gap that isn't airtight. However, it can only move along solid surfaces that aren't highly reflective, not liquid or mirrored surfaces. If the surface it's on is destroyed, the strigoi returns to physical form and is stunned 1. The strigoi loses fast healing while in shadow form but can remain in shadow form indefinitely. A strigoi that is exposed to sunlight while in shadow form becomes slowed 2 and must attempt a DC 16 flat check at the end of each of its turns. If it fails this flat check, it is destroyed, the shadow vanishing with a blood-curdling wail. Thassilonian Necromancer Aliriel cannot cast abjuration or enchantment spells. ",
