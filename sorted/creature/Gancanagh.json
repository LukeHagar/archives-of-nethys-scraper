Embodiments of free love, they eagerly throw themselves into courting targets for brief but earnest flings until their quicksilver passions change their desires. They serve Cayden Cailean as well as other bacchanalian deities and empyreal lords of Elysium who understand their desires for love and parties. Gancanaghs hate evil beings that profane the spirit of romance and passion, as such creatures (especially the demonic tempters known as succubi) reinforce stigmas against open and free love. One can give no greater insult to a gancanagh than to mistake him for such a creature, and more than one hotheaded gancanagh has challenged a misinformed paladin or other champion of good to a duel over such a slight. While they enjoy drinking and carousing, gancanaghs can’t stand smoke. Nonetheless, many gancanaghs carry whimsical-looking smoking pipes because they think it makes them look dapper. They cherish their silver flutes, for they enjoy the beauty of flutes’ music and its ability to sway the heart.\n\nThe majority of gancanaghs present themselves as male, but the concept of gender to a creature like a gancanagh, which can change its shape freely, is much more fluid and open to interpretation than for many mortals. Gancanaghs enjoy using this flexibility to confront and test mortals’ convictions when faced with fear or prejudice, but when encountering mortals who themselves are open-minded about sexuality or gender identity, they can become lifelong allies. For those who are persecuted for such reasons, gancanaghs are tireless defenders and eager supporters, quick to provide safety and to punish those who would attempt to impose narrower beliefs upon a world that deserves more diversity than it often gets. If possible, a gancanagh seeks to educate and redeem those who hold destructive beliefs or prejudices, resorting to combat only to defend themself or an endangered mortal, or when no other option seems tenable—yet even then, they fight with sadness.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Celestial](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 19\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 17\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 14\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Azata_Gancanagh.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 4\">[Gancanagh](/Monsters.aspx?ID=35)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"CG\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Azata\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=17\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Celestial\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=23\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 31</row>\n\n**Perception** +11; darkvision\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Celestial](/Languages.aspx?ID=16), [Draconic](/Languages.aspx?ID=2), [Infernal](/Languages.aspx?ID=19); [_tongues_](/Spells.aspx?ID=340)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +9, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +13, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +13, [Performance](/Skills.aspx?ID=12) +14, [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13) +9, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +11\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +1\r\n\r\n**Dex** +5\r\n\r\n**Con** +3\r\n\r\n**Int** +2\r\n\r\n**Wis** +1\r\n\r\n**Cha** +5\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n[silver](/Equipment.aspx?ID=277) [rapier](/Weapons.aspx?ID=36), [silver](/Equipment.aspx?ID=277) [virtuoso flute](/Equipment.aspx?ID=37)\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 21 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +9 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +13 \r\n\r\n**Will** +11 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 75\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\ncold iron 5, evil 5\r\n\r\n**Vulnerable to Smoke** A gancanagh’s lungs can’t tolerate smoke.
