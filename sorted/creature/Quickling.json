These malicious fey creatures delight in striking with blinding speed and accuracy, racing in to stab and slash at foes before scampering away for cover with maddening— even frightening—swiftness. Stories of people simply doubling over, bleeding from what appear to be spontaneously opening wounds, are often eyewitness accounts of quickling attacks.\n\n Quicklings actively hate the “slow-paced dullards” they encounter every day, delighting in inflicting suffering and pain on creatures they deem too sluggish to matter. While they are related to kinder fey such as [brownies](/Monsters.aspx?ID=575) and [pixies](/Monsters.aspx?ID=391), quicklings care only for their own merriment. They see their own cruel pranks as the height of humor and have full confidence that their speed and invisibility will keep them safe from harm. They occasionally form gangs of up to a dozen individuals, although the group usually devolves very quickly into mayhem, as they inevitably perform increasingly deadly pranks against each other.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Fey](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 20\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 18\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 15\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Quickling.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 3\">[Quickling](/Monsters.aspx?ID=778)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"CE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Small\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fey\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=69\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 218 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +9; [low-light vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=23)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Aklo](/Languages.aspx?ID=13), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Sylvan](/Languages.aspx?ID=10)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +13, [Crafting](/Skills.aspx?ID=4) +8, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +8, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +8, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +11, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +6, [Thievery](/Skills.aspx?ID=17) +11\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +0\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +1\r\n\r\n**Int** +3\r\n\r\n**Wis** +1\r\n\r\n**Cha** +3\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n[Lethargy Poison](/Equipment.aspx?ID=120) (3 doses), [Shortsword](/Weapons.aspx?ID=43)\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 22 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +6 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +13 \r\n\r\n**Will** +8 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 25\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\ncold iron 5\r\n\r\n**Slow Susceptibility** The quickling takes a –2 status penalty to saving throws against effects that cause the [slowed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=35) condition.
