These solitary and nomadic creatures primarily dwell in the jungles and savannas of the Mwangi Expanse, but they can range into nearby areas in search of prey or when drawn by strange primal forces only slanas can recognize. Slanas view each other as rivals who test each other's prowess, so when drawn together by this strange calling they nearly always fight to the death. A slana's roar echoes like thunder across the countryside, and denizens of the Mwangi fear a slana's approach whenever an oncoming storm's thunder seems more ferocious than its rain.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 45\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 43\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 40\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Slana.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 20\">[Slana](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1798)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Rare\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=137\" />\r\n<trait label=\"CN\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Gargantuan\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #174: Shadows of the Ancients](/Sources.aspx?ID=115) pg. 84</row>\n\n**Perception** +36; [low-light vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=23), [scent](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=33) (imprecise) 120 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Sylvan](/Languages.aspx?ID=10)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +35, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +38, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +35, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +33, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +37\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +10\r\n\r\n**Dex** +7\r\n\r\n**Con** +7\r\n\r\n**Int** +2\r\n\r\n**Wis** +7\r\n\r\n**Cha** +6\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 45 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +35 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +33 \r\n\r\n**Will** +33 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 380\r\n([fast healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=15) 20)\n\n**Immunities**\r\n[frightened](/Conditions.aspx?ID=19)\r\n\r\n**Resistances**\r\n[sonic](/Traits.aspx?ID=147) 30\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 60 feet, climb 30 feet, swim 30 feet; [_freedom of movement_](/Spells.aspx?ID=128)\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njaws +38 ([Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [reach 20 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192), [Sonic](/Traits.aspx?ID=147)),\r\n**Damage** 4d10+20 piercing plus 2d8 sonic and [Improved Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=27)\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nclaw +38 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [reach 20 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192), [Sonic](/Traits.aspx?ID=147)),\r\n**Damage** 4d6+20 piercing plus 2d8 sonic\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nthunderclap +35 ([Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [range 120 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=248), [Sonic](/Traits.aspx?ID=147)),\r\n**Damage** thunder trap\r\n\r\n**Primal Innate Spells** DC 40, attack +32\r\n- **1st**\r\n[Obscuring Mist](/Spells.aspx?ID=210) (at will)\r\n- **9th**\r\n[Dispel Magic](/Spells.aspx?ID=78), [Storm Lord](/Spells.aspx?ID=477) (×3)\r\n- **10th**\r\n[Earthquake](/Spells.aspx?ID=95), [Storm of Vengeance](/Spells.aspx?ID=313)\r\n- **Constant (4th)**\r\n[Freedom of Movement](/Spells.aspx?ID=128)\r\n\r\n**Great Roar** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([Evocation](/Traits.aspx?ID=65), [Primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=134), [Sonic](/Traits.aspx?ID=147)) The slana emits a deafening roar.
