He grew to be a strong, thoughtful young man, eager to help harvest crops, build farmhouses, or haul furniture. Ufi loved his family and his village and considered himself blessed by the love they showed him in return.\n\n During an outing to collect wood, Ufi discovered an ancient set of stone beads engraved with an intricate design resembling rays of light. A passing pilgrim took note of the beads and identified them as sacred to [Tlehar](/Deities.aspx?ID=217), an ancient goddess once worshipped in the city of Mzali. The pilgrim told the village that Ufi was blessed by Tlehar, destined for greater things, and he recommended Ufi hone his skills at the Magaambya. Ufi felt uncertain about leaving his village, but he traveled with the pilgrim to Nantambu, learning of Tlehar's lore along the way. He now wishes to learn as much as he can about magic and his new faith, and he hopes to protect his classmates and make his village proud.\n\n Ufi likes all his fellow students, but he's particularly captivated by Zane's easygoing demeanor and wit.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 25\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 23\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 20\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 1\">[Ufi](/NPCs.aspx?ID=1753)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Unique\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=161\" />\r\n<trait label=\"NG\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Human\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=90\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Threshold of Knowledge](/Sources.aspx?ID=109) pg. 14</row>\n\n**Perception** +7\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Mwangi](/Languages.aspx?ID=39)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +6, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +4, [Farming Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +3, [Medicine](/Skills.aspx?ID=9) +7, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +7, [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13) +7\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +3\r\n\r\n**Dex** +0\r\n\r\n**Con** +1\r\n\r\n**Int** +0\r\n\r\n**Wis** +4\r\n\r\n**Cha** +1\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n[Backpack](/Equipment.aspx?ID=4), [Chain Mail](/Armor.aspx?ID=9), [Club](/Weapons.aspx?ID=2), [Healer's Tools](/Equipment.aspx?ID=25), [Morningstar](/Weapons.aspx?ID=8), [wooden religious symbol](/Equipment.aspx?ID=41) of [Tlehar](/Deities.aspx?ID=217), [Steel Shield](/Shields.aspx?ID=3) (Hardness 5, HP 20, BT 10), 8 sp\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 17 (19 with shield raised)\r\n\r\n**Fort** +6 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +3 \r\n\r\n**Will** +9 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 17\n\n**Shield Block** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> **Requirement** Ufi has his shield raised; **Effect** Ufi's shield prevents him from taking an amount of damage up to the shield's Hardness.
