Amid the courts of the Eldest or of powerful fey rulers, these sinister assassins lurk overhead as they await the call to action—implied threats akin to deadly weapons hung as decor in a royal hall. Ankous never speak aloud; when they feel the need to communicate at all, they do so in a telepathic whisper directly into a victim's mind. While an ankou's body is made of strange, fleshy material, their claws and the cruel hooks on their wings are made of razor-sharp cold iron, a quality that makes them much feared among other fey. A typical ankou is 10 feet tall and has an 8-foot wingspan but weighs less than 80 pounds.\n\nWhile most ankous serve powerful masters, some of these murderous fey are left to their own devices and serve none but their own capricious, cruel whims. In some cases, their master may have been slain, while in others the ankou may have been released from service for any number of reasons. An ankou left to indulge their own whims unrestrained is often the most dangerous ankou of them all!\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Fey](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 32\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 30\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 27\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Ankou.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 14\">[Ankou](/Monsters.aspx?ID=547)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"LE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fey\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=69\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 19 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +25; [lifesense 120 feet](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=21), [low-light vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=23)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Aklo](/Languages.aspx?ID=13), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Sylvan](/Languages.aspx?ID=10); (can't speak any languages); [telepathy 100 feet](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=37)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +28, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +25, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +27, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +22, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +28\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +7\r\n\r\n**Dex** +8\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** +2\r\n\r\n**Wis** +2\r\n\r\n**Cha** +5\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 36 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +23 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +28 \r\n\r\n**Will** +24 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 280\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\ncold iron 10\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** fly 75 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nclaw +29 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [cold iron](/Traits.aspx?ID=131)),\r\n**Damage** 3d6+15 slashing\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nwing +29 ([cold iron](/Traits.aspx?ID=131), [reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 2d6+15 piercing plus 2d6 [persistent bleed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=29) \r\n\r\n**Primal Innate Spells** DC 34, attack +26\r\n- **1st**\r\n[Ray of Enfeeblement](/Spells.aspx?ID=244)\r\n- **2nd**\r\n[Silence](/Spells.aspx?ID=287)\r\n- **4th**\r\n[Darkness](/Spells.aspx?ID=59) (at will), [Dimensional Anchor](/Spells.aspx?ID=70)\r\n- **6th**\r\n[True Seeing](/Spells.aspx?ID=344)\r\n- **7th**\r\n[Prismatic Spray](/Spells.aspx?ID=233), [Teleport](/Spells.aspx?ID=338)\r\n- **8th**\r\n[Discern Location](/Spells.aspx?ID=75)\r\n\r\n**Shadow Doubles** <actions string=\"Single Action to Three Actions\" /> ([Illusion](/Traits.aspx?ID=92), [Occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120), [Shadow](/Traits.aspx?ID=143)) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** For each action spent to use this ability, the ankou creates one shadowy duplicate of themself anywhere within 60 feet of themself.
