An expert in travel through difficult environments, the Rain-Scribe provides for their companions while helping them avoid the many hazards of travel in the Inner Sea. Rain-Scribes are some of the most well-traveled members of the academy, and most have secured alliances or promises of safe passage through the lands where they walk.\n\n Should the Rain-Scribe or their companions be attacked on their journeys, the scribe is a capable combatant who strives to turn their communion with the natural world into their greatest advantage in battle. Whether by using primal magic against their foes or striking unseen from the underbrush, the Rain-Scribe assures that no opponent threatens their traveling companions for long.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 19\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 17\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 14\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 4\">[Rain-Scribe](/NPCs.aspx?ID=971)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"NG\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Elf\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=58\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Human\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=90\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Character Guide](/Sources.aspx?ID=12) pg. 124 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +13; [low-light vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=23)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Druidic](/Languages.aspx?ID=23), [Mwangi](/Languages.aspx?ID=39)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +9, [Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2) +7, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +8, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +12, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +11, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +12\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +2\r\n\r\n**Dex** +3\r\n\r\n**Con** +1\r\n\r\n**Int** +1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +4\r\n\r\n**Cha** +0\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n[Composite Longbow](/Weapons.aspx?ID=74) (20 arrows), [Hide Armor](/Armor.aspx?ID=7), [Scimitar](/Weapons.aspx?ID=38), _scroll of [_speak with animals_](/Spells.aspx?ID=293)_\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 21 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +9 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +9 \r\n\r\n**Will** +12 \r\n\r\n+1 status to all saves vs. poison\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 54\n\n**Resistances**\r\npoison 2\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 40 feet (from [_longstrider_](/Spells.aspx?ID=175))\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nscimitar +9 ([Forceful](/Traits.aspx?ID=180), [Sweep](/Traits.aspx?ID=194)),\r\n**Damage** 1d6+2 slashing\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\ncomposite longbow +10 ([deadly d10](/Traits.aspx?ID=174), [Propulsive](/Traits.aspx?ID=191), [range increment 100 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=248), [reload 0](/Traits.aspx?ID=254), [volley 30 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=201)),\r\n**Damage** 1d8+1 piercing\r\n\r\n**Primal Prepared Spells** DC 21, attack +11\r\n- **Cantrips (2nd)**\r\n[Detect Magic](/Spells.aspx?ID=66), [Electric Arc](/Spells.aspx?ID=97), [Know Direction](/Spells.aspx?ID=169), [Light](/Spells.aspx?ID=171), [Tanglefoot](/Spells.aspx?ID=330)\r\n- **1st**\r\n[Gust of Wind](/Spells.aspx?ID=143) (×2), [Longstrider](/Spells.aspx?ID=175) (already cast)\r\n- **2nd**\r\n[Acid Arrow](/Spells.aspx?ID=2), [Entangle](/Spells.aspx?ID=103), [Spider Climb](/Spells.aspx?ID=299)\r\n\r\n**Druid Order Spells** DC 21, 2 Focus Points\r\n- **2nd**\r\n[Tempest Surge](/Spells.aspx?ID=479)\r\n\r\n**Chameleon Step** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([Illusion](/Traits.aspx?ID=92), [Primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=134), [Visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=163)) **Frequency** once per day; **Requirements** The Rain-Scribe must be in natural terrain. **Effect** The Rain- Scribe shifts their coloration and the coloration of their gear to match the surroundings and then immediately [Sneaks](/Actions.aspx?ID=63), even while being observed.
