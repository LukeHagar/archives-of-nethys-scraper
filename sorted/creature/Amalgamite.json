It requires precise calculation and timing, knowledge of the intended destination, and meticulous control over surging conjuration magics. A mistake in even the most minute element of such a spell can lead to disastrous results for those involved. When a particularly powerful spellcaster makes an error of this kind, either through arrogance or simple misjudgment, they might transform into an amalgamite.\n\n A mass of flesh and misaligned limbs, an amalgamite is the warped body of a former spellcaster, sometimes joined with another version of itself to incorporate additional limbs or other irregularities. They're still alive, but they have become aberrants mentally and physically, with only the vaguest memories of their previous existence, which makes them a dangerous and bewildering foe. Their weird, warped anatomy constantly shifts and regrows, allowing the creatures to shrug off physical blows save those that pierce through its flesh and into its core being.\n\n The magical residue of an amalgamite's creation radiates from it, seeping into and destabilizing any living beings that get too close. Infected creatures then further spread the amalgamite's aura among larger groups of allies and foes alike. The amalgamite uses this power to manipulate and confuse their enemies, whom they can teleport into traps, force into confrontations with other enemies, or draw close into striking range with their own odd appendages.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Aberration](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11)): DC 36\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 34\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 31\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Amalgamite.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 13\">[Amalgamite](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1059)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Rare\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=137\" />\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Aberration\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=1\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 3](/Sources.aspx?ID=66) pg. 14</row>\n\n**Perception** +23; [low-light vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=23)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Aklo](/Languages.aspx?ID=13), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Draconic](/Languages.aspx?ID=2)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2) +27, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +22, [Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +27, [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11) +27\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +5\r\n\r\n**Dex** +6\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** +8\r\n\r\n**Wis** +6\r\n\r\n**Cha** -1\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 33 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +22 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +22 \r\n\r\n**Will** +26 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 220\r\n\r\n, regeneration 10 (deactivated by piercing)\r\n\r\n**Immunities**\r\n[controlled](/Conditions.aspx?ID=6), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)\r\n\r\n**Resistances**\r\nbludgeoning 10, slashing 10\r\n\r\n**Weaknesses**\r\npiercing 10\r\n\r\n**Destabilizing Field** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [conjuration](/Traits.aspx?ID=33)) 40 feet.
