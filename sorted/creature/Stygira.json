In some regions, stygiras are worshipped as seers or even gods, although they lack the ability to grant spells to clerics and are often not aware of their worshippers at all. In other areas, they have strange ties to the ancient empires of the [cyclopes](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=25), often dwelling in the oversized ruins those creatures left behind long ago. To many stygiras, gemstones harvested from ancient cyclopean mosaics have even greater magical properties than other crystals.\n\n Although technically blind, stygiras do have vestigial eyes hidden beneath the stony, scarred flesh of their faces. Capable of sensing bright lights even through their scars, stygiras are sickened and distracted by these flashing glimpses, so they keep to their caves during the day and wander into the world above only after nightfall. Far from benevolent, they seek out unwary travelers or explorers to capture and reduce them down to the base chemicals and supernatural humors the stygiras require to infuse gemstones with the capacity to give them sight and magical power.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Fey](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 25\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 23\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 20\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Stygira.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 7\">[Stygira](/Monsters.aspx?ID=821)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"LE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Earth\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=55\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fey\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=69\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 255 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +17; gemsight\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Aklo](/Languages.aspx?ID=13), [Cyclops](/Languages.aspx?ID=30), [Jotun](/Languages.aspx?ID=8), [Terran](/Languages.aspx?ID=22)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +15, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +15, [Gem Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +17, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +17, [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11) +17\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +4\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +5\r\n\r\n**Int** +4\r\n\r\n**Wis** +6\r\n\r\n**Cha** +2\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Gemsight** As long as the stygira holds a gemstone, they can see through the gem with [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12) and the effects of [_true seeing_](/Spells.aspx?ID=344).
