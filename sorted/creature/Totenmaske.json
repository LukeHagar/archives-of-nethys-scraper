Though unable to sate their perverse desires, these foul undead can drain the very flesh from their victims so as to wrap themselves in a perverse mockery of life that allows them to pursue their base wants. Totenmaskes' specific longings vary—one might be obsessed with food or drink, while another might be vain and desirous of an attractive form to marvel at in a mirror, while yet another could simply long for the scent of blood. Whatever the sensation the totenmaske seeks, it is always a vice taken to extreme, for this sin is what helped condemn it to unlife in the first place. A totenmaske obsessed with food, for example, might find itself assaulting bakeries or breweries, while a vain totenmaske obsessed with glamor could quickly grow bored of each new look and switch its victims out daily, or even hourly.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Undead](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 23\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 21\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 18\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Totenmaske.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 7\">[Totenmaske](/Monsters.aspx?ID=829)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Undead\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=160\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 262 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +15; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Necril](/Languages.aspx?ID=20)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +15, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +17, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +17, [Thievery](/Skills.aspx?ID=17) +15\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +4\r\n\r\n**Dex** +6\r\n\r\n**Con** +2\r\n\r\n**Int** +1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +2\r\n\r\n**Cha** +3\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 25 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +15 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +17 \r\n\r\n**Will** +13 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 128\r\n([negative healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=42))\n\n**Immunities**\r\n[death](/Traits.aspx?ID=40) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), poison, unconscious\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 40 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njaws +18 ([Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179)),\r\n**Damage** 2d6+7 piercing plus 2d6 negative\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nclaw +18 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179)),\r\n**Damage** 2d8+7 slashing\n\n**Drink Flesh** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([Divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [Necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) **Requirement** The totenmaske hit the same enemy with two claw Strikes this turn and is still adjacent to it; **Effect** The totenmaske drains flesh from the creature's body.

This is either its form from before it became undead, or the form of the last creature it successfully hit with Drink Flesh.

The target can attempt a DC 25 Fortitude save to resist; a critical success grants temporary immunity to Shape Flesh for 24 hours. Each time the totenmaske Shapes Flesh, it chooses one feature: ears (target becomes [deafened](/Conditions.aspx?ID=8)), eyes (target becomes [blinded](/Conditions.aspx?ID=1)), mouth (target can't speak or eat), or nose (target can't smell). A creature with both its nose and mouth sealed can't breathe and begins to [suffocate](/Rules.aspx?ID=468).
