Another myth tells that muckish creeps were elementals so vile that their kin banished them from the [Plane of Earth](/Planes.aspx?ID=5). Regardless of their true origins, muckish creeps are wicked creatures that resemble mud given a humanoid shape. The mud is no ordinary mixture of earth and water, however, for muckish creeps feed on the blood of the living, and they use this blood to keep their own forms moist and malleable.\n\n Muckish creeps are particularly tenacious and single-minded when it comes to choosing prey. Once a muckish creep selects its next victim, there is little one can do to stop it, since it can seep through even the smallest cracks between doors, walls, and windows. A muckish creep typically waits until its target falls asleep before pressing itself into the creature's home, intent to kill. For all its tenacity during the hunt, the muckish creep is pragmatic when it comes to the actual kill, using its body to fill the victim's airways with mud and suffocate them.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Aberration](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11)): DC 24\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 22\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 19\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/MuckishCreep.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 8\">[Muckish Creep](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1400)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Aberration\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=1\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #166: Despair on Danger Island](/Sources.aspx?ID=85) pg. 88</row>\n\n**Perception** +18; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +15, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +18, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +17\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +6\r\n\r\n**Dex** +3\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** +0\r\n\r\n**Wis** +0\r\n\r\n**Cha** +1\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 27 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +20 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +15 \r\n\r\n**Will** +12 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 160\n\n**Resistances**\r\nbludgeoning 8\r\n\r\n**Weaknesses**\r\nfire 8\r\n\r\n**Elude Grasp** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> **Trigger** A creature succeeds at an attempt to [Grapple](/Actions.aspx?ID=35) the muckish creep; **Effect** The muckish creep attempts an [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) check to [Escape](/Actions.aspx?ID=79).\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 25 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nfist +18,\r\n**Damage** 2d10+10 bludgeoning plus [Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=18)\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nmud ball +18 ([thrown 30 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=195)),\r\n**Damage** 2d6+10 bludgeoning plus blinding mud\n\n**Blinding Mud**   When a muckish creep hits a creature with a mud ball Strike, that creature becomes [dazzled](/Conditions.aspx?ID=7) (or [blinded](/Conditions.aspx?ID=1) on a critical hit).
