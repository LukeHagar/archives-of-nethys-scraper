Creatures who visit their favorite watering hole and find only an empty mud basin become prey for the berberoka, who hides in the brush and overwhelm their prey with a massive torrent of regurgitated water.\n\n A berberoka's mottled backside—which resembles a bundle of local plants, small trees, and large rocks—grants them natural camouflage that allows them to hide in plain sight. Berberokas tend to disguise themselves as rock formations in the center of a dried-up waterbed while they lie in wait for passersby. In the tropical regions where berberokas are most common, locals know to give empty ponds a wide berth, regardless of the enticing fish flopping about. Hungry travelers, on the other hand, might see such bounty as a blessing from the gods, only to be swept up in the berberoka's deadly deluge.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 36\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 34\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 31\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Berberoka.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 15\">[Berberoka](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1394)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Huge\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Giant\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=79\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #166: Despair on Danger Island](/Sources.aspx?ID=85) pg. 82</row>\n\n**Perception** +26; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), [scent](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=33) (imprecise) 60 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Jotun](/Languages.aspx?ID=8)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +31, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +27, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +25, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +26, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +25, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +26\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +8\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +6\r\n\r\n**Int** -1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** +4\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Deep Breath** A berberoka can hold their breath for 2 hours.\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 36 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +29 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +23 \r\n\r\n**Will** +24 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 310\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\nfear of crabs\r\n\r\n**[Attack of Opportunity](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=3)** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> <br />**Fear of Crabs** ([emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=68), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) If a berberoka sees a [crab](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=129) or crab-like creature, the berberoka must attempt a DC 33 Will save.
