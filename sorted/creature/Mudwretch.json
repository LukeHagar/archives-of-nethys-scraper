When a living creature approaches, though, the mudwretch lurches upward, piling its muddy flesh upon itself to form a roughly humanoid shape, often in vague mockery of the approaching creature's general form in cases where the creature is a humanoid itself.\n\n Mudwretches possess a low level of intellect, and while they do not form societies or cultures of their own, they are attracted to ruins or abandoned settlements. They have little need to eat, but without a constant source of moisture, a mudwretch dries out, suffering from low throbbing aches until it can resaturate. Often, blood from living creatures has to do—a dried mudwretch is more dangerous to intruders than one that's comfortably wallowing on a river bank.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Elemental](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2), [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 16\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 14\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 11\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Mudwretch.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 2\">[Mudwretch](/Monsters.aspx?ID=734)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Earth\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=55\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Elemental\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=57\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Water\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=165\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 176 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +9; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Terran](/Languages.aspx?ID=22)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +8, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +6\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +4\r\n\r\n**Dex** +0\r\n\r\n**Con** +3\r\n\r\n**Int** -2\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** +0\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Muddy Field** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206)) 10 feet.
