The ecorche uses its claws to flay its victims, stripping off skin in seconds. It can then horrifyingly squeeze itself into the stolen skin and impersonate the deceased, which it does to covertly carry out orders or find more victims to expand its collection. If its deception is uncovered, it shreds its disguise, bursting forth in terrible skinless form.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Undead](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 35\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 33\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 30\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Ecorche.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 16\">[Ecorche](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1855)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"CE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Undead\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=160\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Book of the Dead](/Sources.aspx?ID=118) pg. 90</row>\n\n**Perception** +27; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Necril](/Languages.aspx?ID=20)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +33, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +31, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +27, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +28\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +9\r\n\r\n**Dex** +6\r\n\r\n**Con** +7\r\n\r\n**Int** +0\r\n\r\n**Wis** +5\r\n\r\n**Cha** +5\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 38 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +27 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +30 \r\n\r\n**Will** +27 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 275\n\n**Immunities**\r\n[death](/Traits.aspx?ID=40) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126), [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38)\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 25 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nclaw +33 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170)),\r\n**Damage** 3d8+17 slashing\n\n**Flaying Flurry** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" />  The ecorche attempts two claw Strikes against the same target.

The creature takes 4d8 [persistent bleed damage](/Conditions.aspx?ID=29), and it's [frightened 4](/Conditions.aspx?ID=19) and [stunned 4](/Conditions.aspx?ID=36). The bleed damage can't end naturally, only ending if the creature regains at least 75 HP or regains at least 10 HP from [regeneration](/Rules.aspx?ID=796).<br /> **Success** The target takes 2d8 persistent bleed damage and is stunned 1.\r\n\r\n**Muscular Leap** <actions string=\"Single Action\" />  The ecorche over-stresses its leg muscles for a massive jump. It loses 20 HP and [Leaps](/Actions.aspx?ID=81) up to 120 feet in any direction.

The ecorche reverts to its true appearance and size, and anyone within 120 feet who witnesses this must succeed at a DC 37 Will save or become [frightened 2](/Conditions.aspx?ID=19) (frightened 4 on a critical failure). Regardless of the results of their saving throws, the creatures are temporarily immune for 24 hours.\r\n\r\n**Wear Skin** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([Manipulate](/Traits.aspx?ID=104)) **Requirements** The ecorche is holding the stolen skin of a Small, Medium, or Large creature and isn't already wearing a skin; **Effect** The ecorche wears the skin as a disguise. It assumes the creature's size, appearance, and voice. Wearing Skin counts as creating a disguise for the [Impersonate](/Actions.aspx?ID=46) use of [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5).<br /> The ecorche's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether it's a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and the ecorche gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise.<br /> Wearing a skin gives the ecorche a +2 item bonus to AC and 75 temporary Hit Points. If the ecorche takes more than 50 slashing damage from a single source, the skin becomes broken. When broken, the skin no longer provides any of these benefits (any remaining temporary HP are immediately lost) but can still be used for Tear Skin.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">The Ecorche's Collection</title>\r\n\r\nIf the ecorche receives a space of its own, it decorates it by hanging skins on the walls and displaying any bodies it has claimed from victims on pedestals—skinless—to admire their musculature.

Anyone who eavesdrops on the unsettling conversation is treated to a dialogue like someone would have with a favored pet.\r\n</aside>",
