Sigbins drink the blood of their victims by biting into their shadows, rather than their flesh. This process typically leaves the victim so fatigued that they must lie down to rest, at which point the sigbin finishes the job by sinking their jaws into the person's chest and consuming their heart.\n\n Due to their nauseating smell, many sigbins hide among livestock and in other overwhelmingly odorous places. Sigbins have the ability to hide in plain sight simply by standing stock still, but this power works only against adults and elders; for whatever reason, children and young animals can see the invisible sigbins. Many believe this is because children are unsullied by the cruel ways of the world, and so their eyes are still innocent enough to spot the devious beasts. Unfortunately, most adults tend to ignore children's cries about the monsters, chalking up such claims to overactive imaginations or attention-seeking behavior, inadvertently allowing sigbins to continue their hunts uninterrupted.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Beast](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2), [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 20\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 18\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 15\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Sigbin.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 5\">[Sigbin](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1401)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Small\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Beast\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=20\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #166: Despair on Danger Island](/Sources.aspx?ID=85) pg. 89</row>\n\n**Perception** +12; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), scent (imprecise) 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1); (can't speak any language)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +12, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +10, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +14\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +1\r\n\r\n**Dex** +5\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** -1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +1\r\n\r\n**Cha** +2\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 21 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +13 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +16 \r\n\r\n**Will** +8 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 75\n\n**Stench** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [olfactory](/Traits.aspx?ID=246)) 30 feet.
