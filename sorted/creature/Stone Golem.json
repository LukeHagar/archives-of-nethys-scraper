They’re often made to serve as works of art when at rest, so some golem crafters employ master sculptors to ensure the constructs make beautiful statues. Older stone golems might be weathered, with scuffed or cracked surfaces or missing noses and digits, but this weathering is largely cosmetic and doesn’t adversely impact the golems’ functionality.\n\n Tales tell of particularly immense stone golems residing in certain ancient ruins. Survivors from time-lost civilizations bent on carrying out orders from long-gone masters, these immense stone golems are much more powerful than most stone golems. They are always level 15 or higher and never smaller than Huge in size—most are Gargantuan. Because their size is so great and the structures they dwell in so dilapidated, the awakening of such a stone golem can cause surrounding structures to collapse, ancient foundations to buckle, and ceilings to come crashing down on foes. In addition to the statistics here, these massive stone golems attack with wide, sweeping strikes capable of knocking down multiple targets at once.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Construct](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2), [Crafting](/Skills.aspx?ID=4)): DC 30\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 28\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 25\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Golem_StoneGolem.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 11\">[Stone Golem](/Monsters.aspx?ID=241)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Construct\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=35\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Golem\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=220\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Mindless\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=108\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 187</row>\n\n**Perception** +17; darkvision\r\n\r\n**Languages**\n\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +26\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +7\r\n\r\n**Dex** -1\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** -5\r\n\r\n**Wis** +0\r\n\r\n**Cha** -5\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 30 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +24 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +18 \r\n\r\n**Will** +19 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 175\n\n**Immunities**\r\nacid, bleed, death effects, disease, doomed, drained, fatigued, healing, magic (see below), mental, necromancy, nonlethal attacks, paralyzed, poison, sickened, unconscious\r\n\r\n**Resistances**\r\nphysical 10 (except adamantine)\n\n**Golem Antimagic** harmed by cold and water (5d10, 2d8 from areas and persistent damage); healed by acid (area 2d8 HP); slowed by earth<br /> **Vulnerable to Stone to Flesh** A [_stone to flesh_](/Spells.aspx?ID=311) spell negates the golem’s golem antimagic and its resistance to physical damage for 1 round.
