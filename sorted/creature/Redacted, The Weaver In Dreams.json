An astral body is immune to physical damage but affected normally by [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106) effects, [force](/Traits.aspx?ID=75) effects, and effects that directly target the spirit. The target remains connected to their physical body by a silver cord, which is always visible and possibly foils attempts to [Hide](/Actions.aspx?ID=62).

The target can use a single action, which has the [concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32) trait, to move their astral body an amount equal to their Speed. When the target stops taking persistent mental damage from this ability, the astral body snaps back to the physical body, ending the effect. If a target is carrying [silver](/Equipment.aspx?ID=277), then the first time this ability is used on them, the ability fails and any silver they're carrying larger than a coin tarnishes—while this doesn't outright destroy items like weapons or thaumaturge implements, it does prevent them from protecting against this ability more than once.\r\n\r\n**Sever Astral Threads** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" />  The Weaver uses a claw to cut the silver cord connecting a creature's astral and physical bodies. This deals 16d6 mental damage to any target affected by Separate Astral Body whose physical or astral body is within 10 feet of the Weaver (DC 37 [basic](/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Will save).

This creates a 10-foot emanation that deals 3d6 mental damage and 3d6 slashing damage, with a DC 36 basic Will save. A creature Averting its Gaze is immune to the aura. Nameless Nightmare The Weaver has torn off his own name to become a being of fear. He is immune to linguistic effects and any effect that would impose the frightened condition. Without a name, he is difficult for phenomena to affect; the Weaver recovers from the paralyzed, slowed, and stunned conditions at the end of his turn, and his flat check to clear persistent damage is 5. If anyone utters, writes, or otherwise attempts to record his name, that creature automatically takes 10 mental damage and the attempt fails. Stitch into the Web Reaction Trigger The Weaver is moved against his will, or a creature attempts to leave a square within 20 feet of him by any means, including teleportation; Effect The Weaver's silk stitches a body in place to prevent movement.

Sever Astral Threads Two Actions The Weaver uses a claw to cut the silver cord connecting a creature's astral and physical bodies. This deals 16d6 mental damage to any target affected by Separate Astral Body whose physical or astral body is within 10 feet of the Weaver (DC 37 basic Will save). After being targeted by this ability, the astral body slams violently back into the target's physical body, causing the target's vision to swim and blinding them until the start of their next turn unless they critically succeeded at their saving throw.
