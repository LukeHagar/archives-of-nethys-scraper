Their sleek black scales and serpentine grace allow them to strike from hiding, and they are known for playing with their prey before finally finishing it. These creatures of shadowy energy and unwholesome appetites prefer the necrotic flesh of undead creatures to any other meal. This strange hunger can be of accidental benefit to nearby humanoid societies, but ultimately they hunt and kill undead creatures for the taste, rather than out of any desire to protect others from the undead. The benefit is always short-lived, however. When umbral dragons exhaust their preferred prey, they turn on whatever living creatures happen to be nearby. Umbral dragons sometimes go to great lengths to obtain their favorite meals, even creating undead creatures that they then feast upon.\n\nFor all their power, umbral dragons are uninterested in fair battles. When faced with foes that pose any kind of actual danger to them, umbral dragons flee into the shadows and seek to strike back through pawns or minions rather than risk their own lives. Their treasure hoards are varied and diverse, often augmented by loot stolen from crypts the dragons have turned into feeding grounds. They have a strong respect for and interest in traditions and heirlooms, and they often seek to augment their hoards with items of great value that have been handed down through the generations of those whose corpses and ghosts they've fed upon.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Dragon](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2)): DC 30\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 28\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 25\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/DragonUmbral.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 11\">[Young Umbral Dragon](/Monsters.aspx?ID=634)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Dragon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=50\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Shadow\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=143\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 96 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +22; [greater darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), [scent (imprecise) 60 feet](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=33)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Draconic](/Languages.aspx?ID=2), [Shadowtongue](/Languages.aspx?ID=21)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +18, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +22, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +22, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +22, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +20, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +20, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +22\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +7\r\n\r\n**Dex** +3\r\n\r\n**Con** +5\r\n\r\n**Int** +3\r\n\r\n**Wis** +5\r\n\r\n**Cha** +3\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 31 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +22 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +20 \r\n\r\n**Will** +22 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 195\n\n**Immunities**\r\nnegative, [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [sleep](/Traits.aspx?ID=145)\n\n**[Frightful Presence](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=17)** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=68), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) 90 feet, DC 26<br />**[Attack of Opportunity](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=3)** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> Jaws only.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 40 feet, fly 140 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njaws +24 ([Negative](/Traits.aspx?ID=118), [reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 2d10+13 piercing plus 2d6 negative\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nclaw +24 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170)),\r\n**Damage** 2d10+13 slashing\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\ntail +22 ([reach 15 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 2d12+13 slashing\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nwing +22 ([reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 1d10+13 slashing\r\n\r\n**Primal Innate Spells** DC 30\r\n- **Cantrips (4th)**\r\n[Detect Magic](/Spells.aspx?ID=66)\r\n- **4th**\r\n[Darkness](/Spells.aspx?ID=59) (×3)\r\n\r\n**Breath Weapon** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([Necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117), [Negative](/Traits.aspx?ID=118), [Primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=134)) The dragon breathes a blast of darkness that deals 12d6 negative energy damage in a 30-foot cone (DC 30 basic Reflex save).
