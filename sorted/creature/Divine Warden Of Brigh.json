The divine warden shuts down immediately once it has 0 time remaining.<br /> A divine warden can enter standby mode as a 3-action activity. Its operational time doesn't decrease in standby, but it can sense its surroundings (with a â€“2 penalty to Perception). It can't act, with one exception: when it perceives a creature, it can exit standby as a reaction (rolling initiative if appropriate).<br /> A creature can attempt to [Disable a Device](/Actions.aspx?ID=69) to wind a divine warden down (DC 27).
