[Clockwork soldiers](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1096) are often too costly to employ en masse, so municipalities looking to cut corners devised the much-cheaper clockwork handler, a budget-friendly construct sufficient for rat catching, door watching, and basic patrol work.\n\n Handlers are typically programmed to react efficiently to certain situations such as intruders or assailants. To that end, all handlers are equipped with an [_everburning torch_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=255) fastened to their hooded lantern-like heads. Furthermore, most clockwork handlers used in public places have their fists covered in a padded material to ensure they don't accidentally beat suspects to death, though these modifications are removable (removing the [nonlethal](/Traits.aspx?ID=188) trait from their fist Strike). The nonlethal approach is considered the safest, as clockwork creatures don't always have the keenest judgement on who is a criminal and who is a customer. A healthy supply of rope allows the clockwork handler to quickly tie-up unruly vagabonds, that they might be brought to justice.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Construct](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2), [Crafting](/Skills.aspx?ID=4)): DC 17\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 15\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 12\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Clockwork_ClockworkHandler.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 1\">[Clockwork Handler](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1925)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Clockwork\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=331\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Construct\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=35\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Mindless\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=108\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #178: Punks in a Powderkeg](/Sources.aspx?ID=119) pg. 83</row>\n\n**Perception** +8; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\n\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +7\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +4\r\n\r\n**Dex** +2\r\n\r\n**Con** +3\r\n\r\n**Int** -5\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** -5\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Wind-Up** 24 hours, DC 15, standby\r\n\r\n**Items**\r\n[Everburning Torch](/Equipment.aspx?ID=255), [Javelin](/Weapons.aspx?ID=71) (4), [Rope](/Equipment.aspx?ID=44) (100 feet)\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 16 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +10 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +7 \r\n\r\n**Will** +6 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 16\n\n**Immunities**\r\n[death](/Traits.aspx?ID=40) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), [doomed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=9), [drained](/Conditions.aspx?ID=10), [fatigued](/Conditions.aspx?ID=15), [healing](/Traits.aspx?ID=89), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117), [nonlethal](/Traits.aspx?ID=188) attacks, [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126), [sickened](/Conditions.aspx?ID=34), [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38)\r\n\r\n**Resistances**\r\nphysical 2 (except [adamantine](/Equipment.aspx?ID=374) or orichalcum)\r\n\r\n**Weaknesses**\r\nelectricity 2, [orichalcum](/Equipment.aspx?ID=276) 2\r\n\r\n**[Attack of Opportunity](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=3)** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> \r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 25 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nfist +7 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Nonlethal](/Traits.aspx?ID=188), [Unarmed](/Traits.aspx?ID=199)),\r\n**Damage** 1d4+4 bludgeoning plus [Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=18)\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njavelin +5 ([thrown 30 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=195)),\r\n**Damage** 1d6+4 piercing\n\n**Hog-tie** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" />  **Requirements** The clockwork handler has a creature [restrained](/Conditions.aspx?ID=33); **Effect** The clockwork handler cuts a length of rope from the supply in its chassis to tie up the restrained creature.
