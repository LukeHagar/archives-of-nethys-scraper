However, letting the natural corruption run its course sometimes results in unsatisfying monsters, so some necromancers speed the process. This is the situation that led to the creation of the first straugh. A priest of [Kabriri](/Deities.aspx?ID=76) made the monstrosity to defend a claimed cemetery from another sect of ghouls who were preying upon the interred bodies. In some places, ghouls use straughs to tunnel into rival warrens or highly fortified mausoleums.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Undead](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 29\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 27\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 24\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Straugh.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 10\">[Straugh](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2158)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"CE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Ghoul\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=218\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Undead\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=160\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #184: The Ghouls Hunger](/Sources.aspx?ID=147) pg. 88</row>\n\n**Perception** +17; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), [scent](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=33) (imprecise) 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\n\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +17, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +22, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +17, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +22, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +22\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +8\r\n\r\n**Dex** +3\r\n\r\n**Con** +7\r\n\r\n**Int** -4\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** +0\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 29 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +22 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +16 \r\n\r\n**Will** +16 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 220\r\n([negative healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=42))\n\n**Immunities**\r\n[death](/Traits.aspx?ID=40) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126), [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38)\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 30 feet, burrow 20 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nbeak +23,\r\n**Damage** 2d12+12 piercing plus ghoul fever and paralysis\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\ntalon +23, ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 2d8+12 piercing plus [Improved Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=27) and paralysis\n\n**Consume Flesh** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([Manipulate](/Traits.aspx?ID=104)) **Requirements** The straugh is adjacent to the corpse of a creature that died within the last hour; **Effect** The straugh devours a chunk of the corpse and regains 7d6 Hit Points.
