These creatures look vaguely like the minute insects they once were, with a sclerotized head and chitinous body plates, six legs, and numerous dorsal spines lining the joints and edges of each segment. However, by feeding on the unholy remains of Xotani, the spawn have manifested many of the traits of the infamous Firebleeder, most notably a blisteringly hot internal temperature and powerful fire attacks—to say nothing of their monstrous size.\n\n Internal heat radiates from every surface of a Xotanispawn, even from its mouth. Any contact with a Xotanispawn results in burns and the risk of catching on fire. Thankfully, Xotanispawn have also inherited Xotani’s weaknesses to cold and sunlight. They are rarely encountered on the surface during the day, opting to emerge from their subterranean lairs only at night.\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Animal](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 41\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 39\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 36\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Xotanispawn.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 17\">[Xotanispawn](/Monsters.aspx?ID=487)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Rare\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=137\" />\r\n<trait label=\"CE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Animal\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=9\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fire\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=72\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #149: Against the Scarlet Triad](/Sources.aspx?ID=14) pg. 91</row>\n\n**Perception** +29; darkvision, tremorsense (imprecise) 60 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\n\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +34, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +31, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +29\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +9\r\n\r\n**Dex** +6\r\n\r\n**Con** +8\r\n\r\n**Int** -5\r\n\r\n**Wis** +4\r\n\r\n**Cha** +5\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n[**Frightful Presence**](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=17) ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=68), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) 60 feet, DC 36\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 40 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +31 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +29 \r\n\r\n**Will** +23 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 340\n\n**Immunities**\r\nchaotic, evil, fire\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\ncold 20\r\n\r\n**Explosion** ([fire](/Traits.aspx?ID=72)) When a Xotanispawn dies, it explodes, dealing 15d8 fire damage to creatures in a 30-foot emanation (DC 39 basic Reflex save).<br />[**Light Blindness**](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=22)<br /> **Internal Furnace** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> ([fire](/Traits.aspx?ID=72)) **Trigger** A creature adjacent to the Xotanispawn touches it or hits it with a physical attack; **Effect** The triggering creature takes 5d8 [persistent](/Conditions.aspx?ID=29) fire damage (DC 37 Reflex save to negate).\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 40 feet, burrow 40 feet, climb 40 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njaws +30 ([reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 4d8+9 piercing plus 2d8 [persistent](/Conditions.aspx?ID=29) fire and [Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=18)\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nclaw +30 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 4d6+9 slashing plus 2d8 [persistent](/Conditions.aspx?ID=29) fire\n\n**Breath Weapon** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([Arcane](/Traits.aspx?ID=11), [Evocation](/Traits.aspx?ID=65), [Fire](/Traits.aspx?ID=72)) The Xotanispawn sprays a 60-foot cone of magma that deals 10d10 fire damage and 2d6 [persistent](/Conditions.aspx?ID=29) fire damage to all creatures in the area (DC 39 basic Reflex save).
