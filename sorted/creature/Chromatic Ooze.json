Although the source of these alchemical concatenations are as varied as the alchemists who attempt to distill them, one of the most common methods for creating them involves combining the essences of multiple types of chromatic dragons together using eldritch alchemical processes. When this type of experimentation goes dangerously wrong—as it often does—the result is a combination of terrible elemental power with the mindless destructive power of an ooze. A chromatic ooze is a rippling, seething substance that shifts through several different colors, but chemical reactions within the ooze can lock its energy and its color into a specific phase for a short time. Whether a chromatic ooze's destructive urges derive from the frustrated ingenuity of an alchemist creator or from the hunger of the chromatic dragons that so often constitute these oozes' forms, the best way to deal with a chromatic ooze is to stay out of its way.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Ooze](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11)): DC 43\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 41\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 38\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Ooze_ChromaticOoze.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 18\">[Chromatic Ooze](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1797)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Rare\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=137\" />\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Mindless\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=108\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Ooze\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=122\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #174: Shadows of the Ancients](/Sources.aspx?ID=115) pg. 81</row>\n\n**Perception** +30; motion sense 240 feet, no vision\r\n\r\n**Languages**\n\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +35\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +9\r\n\r\n**Dex** -5\r\n\r\n**Con** +10\r\n\r\n**Int** -5\r\n\r\n**Wis** +0\r\n\r\n**Cha** -5\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Motion Sense** A chromatic ooze can sense nearby motion through vibration and air movement.\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 28 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +33 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +16 \r\n\r\n**Will** +20 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 550\n\n**Immunities**\r\ncritical hits, [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), precision, [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38), [visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=163)\n\n**Caustic Aura** ([alchemical](/Traits.aspx?ID=6), [aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [olfactory](/Traits.aspx?ID=246)) 90 feet.
