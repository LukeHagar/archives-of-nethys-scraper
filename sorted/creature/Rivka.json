In their natural form, they resemble giant cockroaches with eight razor-like legs and two mouths—one between two vicious pincers plus a second, much larger mouth on their abdomen. With this secondary mouth they feed off the primordial energy of whichever kaiju they've latched onto.\n\n In the wake of a kaiju attack, a rivka detaches from its host and wades into the disaster zone to prey on the unsuspecting populace by presenting itself as an emissary of the kaiju and demanding tribute. According to this cruel charlatan, only sacrifices of blood and gold can appease their master—though of course the rivka absconds with these offerings before the gifts ever reach the kaiju (such tributes would mean little to the kaiju anyway). Particularly heinous rivkas search the rubble for dead victims to impersonate, magically adopting the visage of a beloved city elder or priest in order to stoke the citizens' paranoia.\n\n Drinking kaiju blood has a strange effect on a rivka's anatomy, enriching both its defensive and offensive capabilities with the primal energy of its host. Other creatures have attempted to drink kaiju blood and replicate this phenomenon, always to terrible effect. Clearly rivkas have coevolved with kaiju in order to metabolize their ancient blood.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Aberration](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11)): DC 36\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 34\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 31\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Rivka.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 13\">[Rivka](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1407)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Rare\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=137\" />\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Aberration\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=1\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #167: Ready?
