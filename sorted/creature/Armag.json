He has long forgotten his birth name, as well as much of his childhood, as his brief but overwhelming recent experiences forced these memories out of his mind to make room for bloodlust, an addiction to violence, and obsession with mayhem. Only his worship of [Gorum](/Deities.aspx?ID=7) remains today, yet even this has been corrupted—tainted by the fell influence of the Sisters of the Bloodshot Eye. Little remains in Armag's mind today save for a desire to conquer, to wield the mighty greatsword [_Ovinrbaane_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=1748) in battle, and to revel in the glory of war. While he claims to be the reborn ancient hero, his “memories” of this previous life are largely hallucinations and fantasies implanted by the influence of his weapon.\n\nArmag himself appears as a muscular human with unruly brown hair, a full beard, and an expression that seems incapable of any other visage than anger, wrath, or fury.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 42\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 40\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 37\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Armag.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 14\">[Armag](/NPCs.aspx?ID=2188)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Unique\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=161\" />\r\n<trait label=\"CN\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Human\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=90\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Kingmaker Adventure Path](/Sources.aspx?ID=150) pg. 592</row>\n\n**Perception** +24\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Hallit](/Languages.aspx?ID=37)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +27, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +26, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +24\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +5\r\n\r\n**Dex** +2\r\n\r\n**Con** +5\r\n\r\n**Int** +0\r\n\r\n**Wis** +2\r\n\r\n**Cha** +4\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n_+1 [resilient](/Equipment.aspx?ID=279) [breastplate](/Armor.aspx?ID=10)_, [_Ovinrbaane_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=1748)\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 35 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +28 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +23 \r\n\r\n**Will** +25 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 300\n\n**Resistances**\r\nphysical 10 (weapons only)\n\n**No Time to Die** As long as Armag wields _Ovinrbaane_ and is raging, the combination of the sword's magic and Armag's furious conviction that he is the true Armag protects him from death.
