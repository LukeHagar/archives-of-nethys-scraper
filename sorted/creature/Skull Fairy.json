They aren't [fey](/Traits.aspx?ID=69), but their petite, winged forms and tendency for malevolent mischief has caused the appellation “skull fairy” to stick.\n\n After bursting from the skull of the deceased, a skull fairy seeks out victims to behead. Skull fairies enjoy nothing more than the horrific sound of wrenching a head free from a body. They often wear the skulls of their most recent victim like caps atop their bulbous, oversized heads. Skull fairies take heads they've acquired to isolated caves, where they carefully strip off the flesh and put the skulls on display. If the skull fairy feels the need for new headgear, they hollow out a fresh skull to wear and retire the old one to a place of prominence.\n\n A group of exactly three skull fairies who have each been alive for at least 13 years become much more powerful than their solitary or younger kin. Members of such a coven become stronger and more intelligent, and they set their minds to evil and chaos on a much wider scale—although anything more complicated than wandering about to twist off heads might seem aspirational to a skull fairy. Skull fairies that join a [coven](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=11) gain the [elite adjustments](/Rules.aspx?ID=790) and often acquire more powerful innate spells. [_Nondetection_](/Spells.aspx?ID=209) and [_stinking cloud_](/Spells.aspx?ID=309) are the most common spells a skull fairy coven can access, but others exist. A skull fairy can only join a coven consisting exclusively of other skull fairies\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/SkullFairy.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 3\">[Skull Fairy](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2034)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"CE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Tiny\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Shadow\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=143\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #181: Zombie Feast](/Sources.aspx?ID=139) pg. 87</row>\n\n**Perception** +10; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Aklo](/Languages.aspx?ID=13), [Necril](/Languages.aspx?ID=20), [Sylvan](/Languages.aspx?ID=10)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +9, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +9, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +11, [Thievery](/Skills.aspx?ID=17) +9\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +0\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +0\r\n\r\n**Int** +0\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** +2\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**[Coven](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=11)** A skull fairy adds [_nondetection_](/Spells.aspx?ID=209) and [_stinking cloud_](/Spells.aspx?ID=309) to their coven's spells.\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 19 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +6 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +11 \r\n\r\n**Will** +8 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 45\n\n**Shadowy Pop** When killed, a skull fairy explodes into shadowy, noxious tissue like a burst bubble.
