Bone croupiers take the meaning of “life-consuming” to its literal extreme. These gamblers' lust for cards and dice couldn't be sated in life, so in undeath they haunt the shadowy corners of gambling halls and continue their search for that next hit of adrenaline.\n\n For bone croupiers, gaming takes on a different flavor; with nothing left to lose, these undead turn their attentions toward others, cajoling and palavering normally casual gamers into committing themselves to ever-higher stakes. Before they know it, these unsuspecting victims have called in decadesold favors and put liens on their homes in the hope of winning back just a fraction of the pot. By then, the bone croupier has already claimed their prize—to this undead chiseler, any earnings are incidental, and the real prize is encouraging others to lose their own.\n\n Bone croupiers often enshroud themselves in thick layers of cigar smoke or voluminous robes to mask their undead nature, but they almost always wear wicked grins at the table. This smile is no ruse or part of their poker face, however—the truth is that bone croupiers truly delight in games, regardless of whether they win or lose, and despite their incredible skills of deception and trickery, most simply can't disguise their unbridled mirth.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Undead](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 22\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 20\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 17\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/BoneCroupier.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 5\">[Bone Croupier](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1843)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Undead\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=160\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Book of the Dead](/Sources.aspx?ID=118) pg. 77, [Pathfinder #151: The Show Must Go On](/Sources.aspx?ID=21) pg. 80</row>\n\n**Perception** +11; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Necril](/Languages.aspx?ID=20)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +14, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +14, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +14, [Games Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +12, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +14, [Thievery](/Skills.aspx?ID=17) +14\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +2\r\n\r\n**Dex** +5\r\n\r\n**Con** +2\r\n\r\n**Int** +1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +2\r\n\r\n**Cha** +5\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 22 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +9 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +14 \r\n\r\n**Will** +14 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 50\r\n([negative healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=42))\n\n**Immunities**\r\n[death](/Traits.aspx?ID=40) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126), [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38)\r\n\r\n**Resistances**\r\n[cold](/Traits.aspx?ID=27) 5, piercing 5, slashing 5\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 25 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nclaw +14 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179)),\r\n**Damage** 2d8+5 slashing\r\n\r\n**Occult Innate Spells** DC 22\r\n- **Cantrips (3rd)**\r\n[Prestidigitation](/Spells.aspx?ID=229)\r\n- **1st**\r\n[Illusory Disguise](/Spells.aspx?ID=159)\r\n- **3rd**\r\n[Mind Reading](/Spells.aspx?ID=194)\r\n- **4th**\r\n[Discern Lies](/Spells.aspx?ID=74)\r\n\r\n**Change of Luck** <actions string=\"Free Action\" /> ([Divination](/Traits.aspx?ID=47), [Occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120)) **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** A creature within 30 feet of the bone croupier attempts a check but hasn't rolled the check yet; **Effect** The bone croupier pulls on the threads of luck that bind all things.

The creature rolls 2d6, adding them together to determine the effect. 7 or 11 (healing, positive) The target regains 15 HP. 2, 3, or 12 (negative) The target takes 30 negative damage. If the target is dying, this damage increases its dying condition by 2 instead of 1. Any Other Roll (negative) The target takes 15 negative damage.
