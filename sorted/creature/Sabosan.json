They have thin, emaciated torsos and broad, leathery wings that can reach a span of almost 20 feet. Sabosans' heads, necks, shoulders, and upper chests are covered with red or dark-brown fur that obscures their stretched-thin flesh. Though their ears are large and pointed like a bat's and they can echolocate as bats do, their vision is also quite strong, enough so that they can use it to easily track quarry in low light.\n\n Some naturalist scholars believe that sabosans are distant descendants of humans who were afflicted with [vampirism](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=97) but managed to avoid succumbing to undeath. Others posit they were once a cult of [demon](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=28) worshippers whose dark rites transformed them into their current forms. No matter their true origins, sabosans have infamous reputations among towns and cities south of Golarion's equator. Even mere rumors of sabosans in an area are enough to set off city-wide hunts, and the truly superstitious aren't above setting fires near every grotto, nook, and foxhole they come across in order to smoke out the nocturnal creatures.\n\n Sabosans hunt during the twilight hours or just after dark, when their echolocation gives them an edge over sleeping prey. They are capable hunters but indiscriminating when it comes to food sources; their rapid metabolisms means sabosans must eat nearly 20 pounds of meat and fruit per day, supplemented, of course, with copious amounts of blood.\n\n Sabosans' obscure faith reveres two deities: the slain Demon Lord Vyriavaxus, Lord of Shadows, and the nearly forgotten sun god Easivra. Vyriavaxus has an obvious link with the creatures, with his appearance as a giant bat, but their connection to the sun god hints at a complex depth in sabosan beliefs.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 20\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 18\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 15\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Sabosan.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 5\">[Sabosan](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1279)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 3](/Sources.aspx?ID=66) pg. 217, [Pathfinder #146: Cult of Cinders](/Sources.aspx?ID=7) pg. 91</row>\n\n**Perception** +10; echolocation 20 feet, [low-light vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=23), [scent](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=33) (imprecise) 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Abyssal](/Languages.aspx?ID=12), [Mwangi](/Languages.aspx?ID=39)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +16, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +11, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +16\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +4\r\n\r\n**Dex** +5\r\n\r\n**Con** +2\r\n\r\n**Int** -1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +1\r\n\r\n**Cha** +0\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Echolocation** A sabosan can use their hearing as a precise sense at the listed range.\r\n\r\n**Items**\r\n[Spear](/Weapons.aspx?ID=10)\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 22 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +11 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +14 \r\n\r\n**Will** +10 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 78\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 25 feet, fly 25 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njaws +15 ([Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179)),\r\n**Damage** 2d10+4 piercing plus 1 [persistent bleed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=29)\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nclaw +15 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179)),\r\n**Damage** 2d8+4 slashing plus [Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=18)\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nspear +15,\r\n**Damage** 1d6+7 piercing\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nspear +16 ([thrown 20 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=195)),\r\n**Damage** 1d6+7 piercing\n\n**Drain Blood** <actions string=\"Single Action\" />  **Requirement** The sabosan has a creature [grabbed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=20); **Effect** The sabosan drains blood from the creature.
