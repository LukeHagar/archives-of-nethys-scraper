As a result, their social and political structures are grounded firmly in martial hierarchies, with a strict emphasis on following the orders of one’s superior, no matter if you are accountable to a lowly soldier or report to a powerful officer. As soon as a fire giant can walk, they are fitted with their first suit of forged armor. This armor is constantly remolded and replaced as the fire giant matures, both to ensure they are comfortable with steel against their skin and also to teach the giant as early as possible that they bear the burden of fighting to protect their traditions and way of life. To a fire giant, death is the flame in which the future is forged.\n\n Fire giants are usually identified by their powerful stature, bright-orange hair that flickers and dances as if it were aflame, and heavy steel armor worn over garments of crimson, amber, or black. Most fire giants are covered in scars and refuse to conceal or obstruct them, as each jagged mark serves as a reminder of a valuable lesson they learned in battle. A typical fire giant stands 12 to 16 feet tall, weighs about 7,000 pounds, and lives to be 350 years old.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 27\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 25\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 22\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Giant_FireGiant.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 10\">[Fire Giant](/Monsters.aspx?ID=223)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"LE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fire\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=72\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Giant\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=79\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 172</row>\n\n**Perception** +18; low-light vision\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Jotun](/Languages.aspx?ID=8)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +25, [Crafting](/Skills.aspx?ID=4) +22, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +23\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +7\r\n\r\n**Dex** +0\r\n\r\n**Con** +5\r\n\r\n**Int** +2\r\n\r\n**Wis** +2\r\n\r\n**Cha** +0\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n[sack with 5 rocks](/Equipment.aspx?ID=45), [_+1 half-plate_](/Armor.aspx?ID=12), _+1 [striking](/Equipment.aspx?ID=280) [greatsword](/Weapons.aspx?ID=24)_\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 31 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +23 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +16 \r\n\r\n**Will** +18 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 175\n\n**Immunities**\r\nfire\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\ncold 10\r\n\r\n**Attack of Opportunity** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /><br /> **Catch Rock** <actions string=\"Reaction\" />\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 25 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\n_greatsword_ +24 ([Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192), [versatile P](/Traits.aspx?ID=200)),\r\n**Damage** 2d12+13 slashing\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nfist +23 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 2d8+13 bludgeoning\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nrock +23 ([Brutal](/Traits.aspx?ID=249), [range increment 120 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=248)),\r\n**Damage** 2d8+13 bludgeoning plus 1d6 fire\n\n**Flaming Stroke** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([Evocation](/Traits.aspx?ID=65), [Fire](/Traits.aspx?ID=72), [Primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=134)) The fire giant imbues its blade with flames and makes a greatsword Strike with a –2 circumstance penalty against each creature in a 15-foot line.
