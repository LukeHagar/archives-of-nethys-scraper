Most vampires can turn into a bat, but some can turn into a different creature, such as a rat or a wolf. Use the options in the aerial form and animal form spells as guidelines. A vampire guardian's giant bat form's fangs have a +21 attack bonus and deal 2d6+11 piercing damage. \n<ul><li>Bat The vampire changes into a bat swarm or giant bat. It gains echolocation 40 feet, a land Speed of 20 feet and a fly Speed of 30 feet, and a fangs Strike with the same attack bonus as its highest melee attack. These fangs deal the same amount of damage as the vampire's claws, but deal piercing damage rather than slashing damage.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n**Create Spawn**  ([Divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [Downtime](/Traits.aspx?ID=49), [Necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) If a creature dies after being reduced to 0 HP by Drink Blood, the vampire can turn this victim into a vampire by donating some of its own blood to the victim and burying the victim in earth for 3 nights. If the new vampire is lower level than its creator, it is under the creator's control. If a vampire controls too many spawn at once (as determined by the GM), strong-willed spawn can free themselves by succeeding at a Will saving throw against the vampire's Will DC.\r\n\r\n**Dominate** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([Divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [Enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61), [Incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=93), [Mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [Visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=163)) The vampire can cast [_dominate_](/Spells.aspx?ID=87) at will as a divine innate spell (DC 26). Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the [visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=163) trait. A creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that vampire's Dominate for 24 hours. Fully destroying the vampire ends the domination, but merely reducing the vampire to 0 HP is insufficient to break the spell.\r\n\r\n**Drink Blood** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([Divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [Necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) **Requirement** A [grabbed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=20), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [restrained](/Conditions.aspx?ID=33), [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38), or willing creature is within the vampire's reach. **Effect** The vampire sinks its fangs into that creature to drink its blood. This requires an [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is [drained 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=10) and the vampire guardian regains 13 HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire but increases the victim's drain value by 1. A vampire can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but it gains no HP from doing so.<br /> A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a DC 20 [Medicine](/Skills.aspx?ID=9) check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drain by 1 after 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n**Turn to Mist** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([Concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32), [Divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [Transmutation](/Traits.aspx?ID=157)) The vampire turns into a cloud of vapor, as the [_gaseous form_](/Spells.aspx?ID=129) spell, or back to its normal form. The vampire loses [fast healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=15) while in gaseous form. The vampire can remain in this form indefinitely.\r\n\r\n**[Sneak Attack](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=34)**   A vampire guardian deals 1d6 extra precision damage to [flat-footed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=16) creatures.\r\n\r\n</column>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"creature-family-97\" />",
