Unlike most other fey, duendes have learned from the society that grew around them. They've come to accept the mortal understanding of what being a landlord means, so they expect rent from their perceived tenants. However, their notions of acceptable rent—and the acceptable role of a landlord for that matter—don't really line up with those of most societies.\n\n Duendes' natural abilities allow them to dwell in termite mounds, but as societies arose, they adopted the habit of sleeping in their tenants' homes. This tendency can be bothersome, as duendes don't clean up after themselves, lock doors behind them, or have the basic decency to be visible.\n\n On top of that, they act like they own the places they settle, casting spells on anyone they find annoying. These quirks are usually tolerated, though, as keeping duende happy means that crops grow well and that their magic protects the families in their care. Families aware of their presence are careful to warn invisible duendes before doing things like tossing bathwater out the window or entering a seemingly empty room. These warnings are usually polite but firm, in the vein of “Please move aside!”\n\n More prone to making trouble or being a nuisance than to violence, duendes can still prove dangerous if they feel they have no other recourse. Each one carries a toenail cutter, with full awareness that they can use it to cut other things.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Fey](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 18\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 16\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 13\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Duende.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 2\">[Duende](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1139)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"CN\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Small\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Earth\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=55\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fey\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=69\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 3](/Sources.aspx?ID=66) pg. 87</row>\n\n**Perception** +7; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), [tremorsense](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=40) (imprecise) 60 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Gnomish](/Languages.aspx?ID=5), [Sylvan](/Languages.aspx?ID=10), [Undercommon](/Languages.aspx?ID=11)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Farming Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +7, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +8, [Labor Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +7, [Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14) +7, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +9\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +1\r\n\r\n**Dex** +3\r\n\r\n**Con** +2\r\n\r\n**Int** +1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** +4\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\ntoenail cutter\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 17 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +6 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +9 \r\n\r\n**Will** +9 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 35\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 25 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\ntoenail cutter +10 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Backstabber](/Traits.aspx?ID=172), [Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179)),\r\n**Damage** 1d6+3 slashing\r\n\r\n**Occult Innate Spells** DC 18, attack +10\r\n- **Cantrips (1st)**\r\n[Daze](/Spells.aspx?ID=61), [Guidance](/Spells.aspx?ID=142), [Telekinetic Projectile](/Spells.aspx?ID=334)\r\n- **1st**\r\n[Fear](/Spells.aspx?ID=110), [Phantom Pain](/Spells.aspx?ID=220)\r\n- **2nd**\r\n[Invisibility](/Spells.aspx?ID=164) (self only)\r\n- **3rd**\r\n[Locate](/Spells.aspx?ID=173)\r\n\r\n**Earthmound Dweller** <actions string=\"Three Actions\" /> ([Primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=134), [Transmutation](/Traits.aspx?ID=157)) The duende shrinks to the size of an ant, allowing them to enter very small tunnels within the earth such as anthills or termite mounds.
