There, the genies transformed into the first ghuls, cruel undead that feast on the flesh of the living. The greedy and gluttonous nature of the first ghuls lives on, cursing them with an insatiable need to consume. Ghuls haunt trade routes, cemeteries, and other locations with good hiding places and a regular influx of travelers.

The effect lasts until the end of the ghul's next turn, but the ghul can Sustain a Spell on Luring Laugh. If the ghul attacks, the fascinated condition ends for only the creature that's attacked.
