Fey native to such rivers are often just as capricious. This quality is particularly true of loblobis, cunning carnivores who resemble small, chubby [humans](/Ancestries.aspx?ID=6) with the heads and wings of crested herons.\n\n These malicious tricksters love playing any pranks that result in other creatures being embarrassed, hurt, or even drowned. Their most common “antic” is to cast _water walk_ on a hopeful river-crosser, only to dismiss the spell when their victim has traversed halfway across. Conversely, most loblobis are terrible sports when they're the butt of a joke. It's common wisdom that few creatures can hold a grudge like a loblobi.\n\n Exceptionally vain, loblobis flutter and dance constantly to show off their plumage.
