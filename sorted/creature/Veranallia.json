They rarely interact directly with non-azatas, as most other beings find their nature hard to comprehend, but those who secure their aid find them powerful allies. The lower half of a veranallia's body is made of vegetation that constantly repeats a dizzying cycle of sprouting, blooming, thriving, and wilting. The upper half of their body appears as that of a humanoid of any gender—it is rare for a veranallia to remain consistent in their gender for more than a few seasons at a time.\n\nVeranallias transform the landscape in their wake, bringing creation and destruction alike. The world around them overflows with an abundance of vegetation, with plenty of food for nearby animals, and when they bring destruction, they do so without cruelty, as it is sometimes necessary to make room for new life. They trigger forest fires in woodlands before dry brush piles up to dangerous levels, and bring bitter winters to areas plagued with parasites that thrive in hot weather.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Celestial](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 40\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 38\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 35\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Azata_Veranallia.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 20\">[Veranallia](/Monsters.aspx?ID=560)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"CG\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Azata\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=17\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Celestial\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=23\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 31 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +38; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), [tremorsense (imprecise) 120 feet](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=40)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Celestial](/Languages.aspx?ID=16), [Draconic](/Languages.aspx?ID=2), [Infernal](/Languages.aspx?ID=19); [_speak with animals_](/Spells.aspx?ID=293), [_speak with plants_](/Spells.aspx?ID=294), [_tongues_](/Spells.aspx?ID=340)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +34, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +36, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +38, [Elysium Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +36, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +36, [Medicine](/Skills.aspx?ID=9) +36, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +34, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +38\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +8\r\n\r\n**Dex** +6\r\n\r\n**Con** +8\r\n\r\n**Int** +6\r\n\r\n**Wis** +10\r\n\r\n**Cha** +8\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n_+3 [greater striking](/Equipment.aspx?ID=280) [sickle](/Weapons.aspx?ID=9)_\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 45 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +36 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +34 \r\n\r\n**Will** +38 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 475\n\n**Resistances**\r\nfire 20, cold 20\r\n\r\n**Weaknesses**\r\ncold iron 20, evil 20\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 40 feet, fly 40 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nsickle +39 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179), [Trip](/Traits.aspx?ID=196)),\r\n**Damage** 3d4+16 slashing plus 4d6 cold and 1d6 good\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nvine +39 ([reach 20 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 4d12+16 bludgeoning plus 1d6 good and [Improved Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=27)\r\n\r\n**Divine Innate Spells** DC 42, attack +32\r\n- **6th**\r\n[Baleful Polymorph](/Spells.aspx?ID=17) (at will), [Tangling Creepers](/Spells.aspx?ID=331) (at will)\r\n- **8th**\r\n[Polar Ray](/Spells.aspx?ID=224) (at will), [Sunburst](/Spells.aspx?ID=326) (at will)\r\n- **9th**\r\n[Nature's Enmity](/Spells.aspx?ID=205), [Regenerate](/Spells.aspx?ID=248) (×3), [Storm of Vengeance](/Spells.aspx?ID=313), [Tree Stride](/Spells.aspx?ID=343) (at will)\r\n- **10th**\r\n[Cataclysm](/Spells.aspx?ID=32), [Primal Phenomenon](/Spells.aspx?ID=231) (once per year), [Revival](/Spells.aspx?ID=262)\r\n- **Constant (9th)**\r\n[Endure Elements](/Spells.aspx?ID=99), [Speak with Animals](/Spells.aspx?ID=293), [Speak with Plants](/Spells.aspx?ID=294), [Tongues](/Spells.aspx?ID=340)\r\n\r\n**Rituals** DC 42\r\n\r\n- **2nd**\r\n[Consecrate](/Rituals.aspx?ID=8)\r\n- **3rd**\r\n[Reincarnate](/Rituals.aspx?ID=35)\r\n- **4th**\r\n[Blight](/Rituals.aspx?ID=4), [Plant Growth](/Rituals.aspx?ID=18)\r\n- **6th**\r\n[Awaken Animal](/Rituals.aspx?ID=3), [Commune with Nature](/Rituals.aspx?ID=7), [Primal Call](/Rituals.aspx?ID=19)\r\n\r\n**Alter Weather** <actions string=\"Three Actions\" />  **Frequency** three times per day; **Effect** The veranallia dramatically alters weather patterns in the surrounding area, producing any of the results of a successful 9th-level [control weather](/Rituals.aspx?ID=9) ritual.\r\n\r\n**Rebirth**  ([Divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [Necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The veranallia spends a minute to encase a creature that has been dead for no more than a year in a cocoon.
