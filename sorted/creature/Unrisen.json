Immense care must be taken, for if the ritual is a critical failure, an unrisen can be the result—as many a ritualist has learned to their horror. \n\nUnrisen are barely intelligent, aware only of the agony constantly inflicted by their flawed creation and their resentment for the living. They tend to attack the casters involved in the botched ritual first before lashing out at everyone else around them. Though an unrisen's twisted form is unrecognizable as the intended target of the resurrection, its wordless howls are often disturbingly similar to the deceased's voice. If an unrisen is destroyed before it can rise again, it's reduced to a handful of metallic blue-green salts referred to as essential salts.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Undead](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 28\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 26\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 23\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Unrisen.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 11\">[Unrisen](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1908)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Undead\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=160\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Book of the Dead](/Sources.aspx?ID=118) pg. 153</row>\n\n**Perception** +21; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), [lifesense](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=21) 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1); (can't speak any language)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +24, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +19\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +7\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +5\r\n\r\n**Int** -2\r\n\r\n**Wis** +6\r\n\r\n**Cha** +3\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 28 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +22 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +17 \r\n\r\n**Will** +21 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 220\r\n(meant to live, [negative healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=42))\n\n**Immunities**\r\n[death](/Traits.aspx?ID=40) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126), [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38)\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\nresurrection vulnerability\r\n\r\n**Meant to Live** ([occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) Whenever an unrisen would take damage from [positive](/Traits.aspx?ID=128) energy, it instead heals half that number of Hit Points.<br />**Resurrection Vulnerability** A creature with a prepared or spontaneous spell that can restore the dead to life (such as [_breath of life_](/Spells.aspx?ID=29) or [_raise dead_](/Spells.aspx?ID=243)) can expend an appropriate spell slot as a 2-action activity to destroy an unrisen within 30 feet.
