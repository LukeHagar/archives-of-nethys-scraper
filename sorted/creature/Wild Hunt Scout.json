The target must immediately attempt a Will save against the wild hunt scout's wild gaze. If the creature was already [slowed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=35) by the wild gaze before attempting its save, a failed save causes it to be [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28) for 1 round.

Any _magic missile_ innate spells they have cast that day are restored, allowing them to be cast again. Until the end of their next turn, any creature that takes force damage from the wild hunt scout must succeed at a DC 40 Fortitude save or be [stunned 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=36) (stunned 3 on a critical failure).
