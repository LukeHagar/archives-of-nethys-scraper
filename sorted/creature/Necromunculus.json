These servitors are common creations in Geb, where undead crafters and masterminds have countless years to dabble in necromantic crafts and a great need for unquestioning loyalty from servitors more cunning than other simple undead minions.\n\n Necromunculi are similar to [homunculi](/Monsters.aspx?ID=264), but there are a few notable differences between these undead creatures and the constructs they are named after. A necromunculus may be loyal to its master, but it also seethes with hatred for all undead, including itself. If left to its own devices, a necromunculus immediately begins plotting to kill and gnaw upon any undead with whom it must regularly interact, even its master, even though it has no need to eat. A necromunculus cannot willingly act on this urge so long as it has some other command to obey, so their creators work hard to ensure that they are constantly supplied with tasks to keep them occupied.\n\n Despite their cannibalistic urges, necromunculi are gaining increased in popularity among Geb's undead necromancers. Each creator wishes to see if they can imbue even more of their powers or personality in the delightfully treacherous servants. Besides, they make excellent practice in espionage and logical thinking for would-be Blood Lords.\n\n Necromunculi resemble skeletal, impish humanoids with leathery wings. They are created from a mixture of mud, bonemeal, juniper oil, a few drops of blood from a still-living mammal, and a pound of the creator's own flesh, blood, or bone. Undead creatures lacking a corporeal body can use a pound of flesh, blood, or bone from another willing, intelligent undead subject, but the process generally destroys the volunteer.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Undead](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 16\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 14\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 11\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Necromunculus.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 0\">[Necromunculus](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2033)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Tiny\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Undead\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=160\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #181: Zombie Feast](/Sources.aspx?ID=139) pg. 86</row>\n\n**Perception** +5; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Necril](/Languages.aspx?ID=20); (can't speak any language), undead master link\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +4, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +6\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** -1\r\n\r\n**Dex** +2\r\n\r\n**Con** +1\r\n\r\n**Int** +0\r\n\r\n**Wis** +1\r\n\r\n**Cha** -2\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Undead Master Link** ([arcane](/Traits.aspx?ID=11), [divination](/Traits.aspx?ID=47), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) A necromunculus can't speak, but it is telepathically linked to its undead creator.
