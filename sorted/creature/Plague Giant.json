Like sewer rats or flies that swarm a fresh battlefield, plague giants bear an inborn pathogen that does little harm to the giants themselves (their wretched physical appearances are purely superficial) but can wreak devastation on afflicted victims.\n\n Whatever their origin, the majority of plague giants are so accustomed to being viewed as monstrosities by other humanoids, giant and otherwise, that they become vehemently xenophobic. Some of their communities do permit other types of shunned humanoids—especially those with leprosy and other stigmatized diseases— to join their fold. Whether because they are expelled to the world's worst badlands or because they purposefully seek out such locales, plague giants often settle amid abandoned battlefields, sewer outlets, and other despoiled places. Their close ties to disease lead many to worship [Apollyon](/Deities.aspx?ID=134), the Horseman of Pestilence, or other deities associated with disease. Plague giants claim that their kind is as death itself, violently rejecting the theory often touted among non-giants that they are an offshoot of some other giant ancestry afflicted with a terrible divine curse. (Most other giants also reject this theory.)\n\n Plague giants measure 24 feet tall and weigh 15,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 32\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 30\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 27\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Giant_PlagueGiant.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 14\">[Plague Giant](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1169)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Huge\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Giant\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=79\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 3](/Sources.aspx?ID=66) pg. 111</row>\n\n**Perception** +25; [low-light vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=23)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Jotun](/Languages.aspx?ID=8)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +30, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +24, [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13) +25, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +26\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +8\r\n\r\n**Dex** +6\r\n\r\n**Con** +7\r\n\r\n**Int** +3\r\n\r\n**Wis** +5\r\n\r\n**Cha** +4\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n_+1 [striking](/Equipment.aspx?ID=280) [flail](/Weapons.aspx?ID=19)_, [sack with 5 rocks](/Equipment.aspx?ID=45)\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 35 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +27 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +24 \r\n\r\n**Will** +23 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 285\n\n**Immunities**\r\n[disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46)\n\n**[Catch Rock](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=7)** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> <br />**Retaliatory Scratch** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> **Trigger** A creature within 10 feet makes a melee Strike against the plague giant; **Effect** The plague giant makes a claw Strike against the triggering creature.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 45 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\n_flail_ +31 ([Disarm](/Traits.aspx?ID=175), [Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [reach 15 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192), [Sweep](/Traits.aspx?ID=194), [Trip](/Traits.aspx?ID=196)),\r\n**Damage** 2d6+14 bludgeoning plus 3d6 poison and atrophic plague\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nclaw +30 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 3d6+14 slashing plus atrophic plague\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nrock +28 ([Brutal](/Traits.aspx?ID=249), [range increment 120 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=248)),\r\n**Damage** 3d8+14 bludgeoning\r\n\r\n**Divine Innate Spells** DC 34\r\n- **6th**\r\n[Cloudkill](/Spells.aspx?ID=42), [Death Knell](/Spells.aspx?ID=63) (×3), [Take its Course](/Spells.aspx?ID=456)\r\n\r\n**Atrophic Plague**  ([Disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), [Divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [Necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) **Saving Throw** DC 34 Fortitude; **Stage 1** [enfeebled 2](/Conditions.aspx?ID=13) and [fatigued](/Conditions.aspx?ID=15) (1 day); **Stage 2** enfeebled 3 and fatigued (1 day); **Stage 3** enfeebled 4 and fatigued (1 day); **Stage 4** dead\r\n\r\n**Hurl Corpse** <actions string=\"Single Action\" />  The plague giant picks up a dead or [dying](/Conditions.aspx?ID=11) creature within reach and flings it at a foe.
