Trickster's Step The gimmerling ignores difficult terrain and doesn’t trigger traps with its movement. Gimmerling Locations Gimmerlings are more common in the First World than on the Material Plane and favor hunting grounds on the verges of dangerous places where they might encounter protective creatures to mislead with their disguises.

A gimmerling is likely found with tools (like artisan’s tools, repair kits, and thieves’ tools) and items it can use to appear more vulnerable, such as locks, manacles, and snare kits (which it feigns being trapped by).
