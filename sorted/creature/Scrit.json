They make themselves the nightmare of many scribes and librarians, as they delight in nothing more than destroying books, scrolls, artwork, and other records or writing. The oils on a scrit's skin smears ink and renders text—even magical writing— completely illegible. Once they have smeared every page of a book, scrits devour them whole, absorbing the contents the book used to hold. After eating books they find stupid or funny, scrits hold skits for other gremlins which mock the mortal authors for the amusement of the other fey.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Fey](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 16\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 14\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 11\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Gremlin_Scrit.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 0\">[Scrit](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1612)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"CE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Tiny\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fey\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=69\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Gremlin\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=221\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #169: Kindled Magic](/Sources.aspx?ID=94) pg. 82</row>\n\n**Perception** +6; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Undercommon](/Languages.aspx?ID=11)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +5, [Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +5, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +4, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +7\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +1\r\n\r\n**Dex** +3\r\n\r\n**Con** +2\r\n\r\n**Int** +2\r\n\r\n**Wis** +0\r\n\r\n**Cha** +0\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 16 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +6 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +9 \r\n\r\n**Will** +4 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 18\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\n[cold iron](/Equipment.aspx?ID=375) 2\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 25 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nsticky fingers +7 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179)),\r\n**Damage** 1d4+1 piercing plus nasty ink\r\n\r\n**Primal Innate Spells** DC 16, attack +8\r\n- **Cantrips (1st)**\r\n[Prestidigitation](/Spells.aspx?ID=229)\r\n- **1st**\r\n[Grease](/Spells.aspx?ID=140)\r\n- **2nd**\r\n[Speak with Animals](/Spells.aspx?ID=293) (at will)\r\n\r\n**Eat Book** <actions string=\"Three Actions\" />  A scrit can consume a book after smearing its pages to absorb its contents (it gains no benefit from consuming a book with pages smeared by another scrit).
