These decrepit creatures live out lives of solitude, sought out only by those who are foolish or brave enough to think they can benefit from the spirit naga's powers without paying a heavy price—for most who dare to show such hubris, the price is their own lives.\n\n Spirit nagas seek out desolate ruins and places long associated with death and corruption. These sinister, serpentine beings can be found in abandoned graveyards, crumbled fortresses, rotting swamps, and blighted woodlands. Though they may know little of the actual history of such places, the nagas are nonetheless attracted to the psychic remnants of evil deeds and tormented spirits that remain within the earth and stones there.\n\n Despite their hideous appearance and treatment as pariahs by other nagas, spirit nagas feel a profound pride in their abilities and even in their hermetic existences. They see themselves as connected to a greater force whose mysteries are revealed only to those who can cast off the trappings and morals of “civilized” society. Even so, spirit nagas gleefully accept the worship of other creatures willing to bow to their capricious whims. They often form cults around themselves, using their charm spells and rituals to ensnare the minds of a few key individuals who spread the nagas' foul influence throughout a community.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Aberration](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11)): DC 28\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 26\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 23\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Naga_SpiritNaga.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 9\">[Spirit Naga](/Monsters.aspx?ID=737)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Aberration\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=1\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 179 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +18; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Aklo](/Languages.aspx?ID=13), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +18, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +16, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +17, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +19, [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11) +20, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +20\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +3\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +3\r\n\r\n**Int** +1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** +5\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Coven** A spirit naga adds [_hallucination_](/Spells.aspx?ID=144), [_mind probe_](/Spells.aspx?ID=193), and [_suggestion_](/Spells.aspx?ID=315) to their coven's spells.\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 28 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +15 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +20 \r\n\r\n**Will** +18 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 160\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 25 feet, swim 15 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nfangs +19 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179)),\r\n**Damage** 2d8+9 piercing plus spirit naga venom\r\n\r\n**Occult Spontaneous Spells** DC 28, attack +20\r\n- **Cantrips (5th)**\r\n[Daze](/Spells.aspx?ID=61), [Detect Magic](/Spells.aspx?ID=66), [Mage Hand](/Spells.aspx?ID=177), [Read Aura](/Spells.aspx?ID=246), [Sigil](/Spells.aspx?ID=286)\r\n- **1st**\r\n[Charm](/Spells.aspx?ID=34), [Command](/Spells.aspx?ID=45), [Grim Tendrils](/Spells.aspx?ID=141), [Unseen Servant](/Spells.aspx?ID=352) (4 slots)\r\n- **2nd**\r\n[Blur](/Spells.aspx?ID=28), [Humanoid Form](/Spells.aspx?ID=153), [Mirror Image](/Spells.aspx?ID=197), [Telekinetic Maneuver](/Spells.aspx?ID=333) (4 slots)\r\n- **3rd**\r\n[Dream Message](/Spells.aspx?ID=90), [Mind Reading](/Spells.aspx?ID=194), [Paralyze](/Spells.aspx?ID=213), [Vampiric Touch](/Spells.aspx?ID=354) (4 slots)\r\n- **4th**\r\n[Clairvoyance](/Spells.aspx?ID=40), [Confusion](/Spells.aspx?ID=48), [Fly](/Spells.aspx?ID=125), [Modify Memory](/Spells.aspx?ID=200) (4 slots)\r\n- **5th**\r\n[Black Tentacles](/Spells.aspx?ID=23), [Sending](/Spells.aspx?ID=272), [Subconscious Suggestion](/Spells.aspx?ID=314) (3 slots)\r\n\r\n**Rituals** DC 28\r\n\r\n- **2nd**\r\n[Inveigle](/Rituals.aspx?ID=14)\r\n\r\n**Spirit Naga Venom**  ([Poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126)) **Saving Throw** DC 28; **Maximum Duration** 6 rounds; **Stage 1** 2d6 poison damage and [stupefied 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=37) (1 round); **Stage 2** 2d6 poison damage and [stupefied 2](/Conditions.aspx?ID=37) (1 round)\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Spirit Naga Covens</title>\r\n\r\nLike [hags](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=59), spirit nagas occasionally form small groups of their own kind.
