Whether driven by their own schemes or directives from sinister overlords, brain collectors arrive in living starships to harvest the brains of intelligent creatures. These aberrations draw no nutrition from brains, instead storing them for analysis and as vessels for occult magical energies.\n\n A brain collector’s form evokes that of a tailless scorpion, but the pulsing brain-filled blisters that glisten along its back make them impossible to mistake for merely oversized arachnids. Baleful eyes glare from the joints on their legs, and the unsettling, intrusive whisper-thoughts they telepathically broadcast into the minds of those they seek to feed on can be interpreted as threats or promises alike.\n\n Brain collectors have very little empathy for the denizens of any world they visit, despite the fact that certain cults venerate them, or the Dominion they hail from, as if they were gods. To brain collectors, terrestrial creatures are simply resources for their magical needs and occult powers. They have little interest in worshipping gods or being worshipped themselves, yet they do practice strange forms of religion of their own, in which they consider the primordial forces of deep space as worthy of faith and fear.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Aberration](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11)): DC 26\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 24\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 21\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/BrainCollector.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 8\">[Brain Collector](/Monsters.aspx?ID=57)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"CE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Aberration\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=1\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 46</row>\n\n**Perception** +18; darkvision\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Abyssal](/Languages.aspx?ID=12), [Aklo](/Languages.aspx?ID=13), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Draconic](/Languages.aspx?ID=2), [Protean](/Languages.aspx?ID=33), [Undercommon](/Languages.aspx?ID=11); telepathy 100 feet\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +17, [Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2) +18, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +16, [Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +18, [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11) +21, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +17\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +6\r\n\r\n**Dex** +3\r\n\r\n**Con** +5\r\n\r\n**Int** +4\r\n\r\n**Wis** +4\r\n\r\n**Cha** +3\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 26 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +15 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +13 \r\n\r\n**Will** +18 \r\n\r\n+1 status to all saves vs. magic\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 140\n\n**Immunities**\r\n[confused](/Conditions.aspx?ID=5)\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\nbrain loss\r\n\r\n**Brain Blisters** A brain collector has seven brain blisters on its back that it uses to house stolen brains.
