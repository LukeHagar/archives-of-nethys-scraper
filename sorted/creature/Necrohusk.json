Unlike fleshwarps and recipients of successful necrografts, prospective necrohusks never survive the procedure. After reanimation, they're cunning, animalistic creatures that follow their creator's orders without question. <br />Creating a necrohusk is an incredibly difficult endeavor, fraught with error. Most attempts result in lumps of useless, rotten slurry or malformed undead no more cunning or dangerous than a mundane zombie. The costs in time, experimental subjects, and expensive spell components lead some would-be necromancers to conclude that the results aren't worth the risk. Occasionally, spellcasters can harness the power of the Negative Energy Plane during the process, which lessens the monetary cost but vastly increases the danger, often producing a deadly backlash resulting in the creator's death and a masterless necrohusk. <br />Among the Sutaki, only Ashen Swale and his lieutenants, Turkek and Azi, have the skill and knowledge to create necrohusks with any regularity, although Turkek's interests often lead him away from such gruesome endeavors. Necrohusks are created from volunteers in Ashen Swale's cult or from traitorous Sutaki whom Ashen Swale wants to punish with a ghastly fate.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Undead](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 25\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 23\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 20\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Necrohusk.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 5\">[Necrohusk](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1778)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Rare\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=137\" />\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Undead\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=160\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #176: Lost Mammoth Valley](/Sources.aspx?ID=113) pg. 87</row>\n\n**Perception** +14; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), [lifesense](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=21) (imprecise) 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Hallit](/Languages.aspx?ID=37), [Necril](/Languages.aspx?ID=20); can't speak\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +13, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +12, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +13\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +5\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +1\r\n\r\n**Int** -3\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** -1\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 22 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +10 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +15 \r\n\r\n**Will** +12 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 75\r\n([negative healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=42))\n\n**Immunities**\r\n[death](/Traits.aspx?ID=40) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126), [prone](/Conditions.aspx?ID=31), [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38)\n\n**Skitter** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> **Trigger** A creature misses the necrohusk with a melee Strike; **Effect** The necrohusk Steps.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 30 feet, climb 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njaws +15,\r\n**Damage** 2d6+5 piercing plus 1d6 poison\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nleg +15 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170)),\r\n**Damage** 2d4+5 piercing\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nichor spit +14 ([range 30 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=248)),\r\n**Damage** 3d8 poison and vile innards\n\n**Frenzied Assault** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" />  The necrohusk makes three leg Strikes.
