Whether these unfortunate people met a cruel fate similar to that which spawned Desert's Howl or are spawn of the nightmarish creature itself is unclear. Some reports of encounters with these creatures note that it's possible to revert the creature back to its humanoid form by cleansing its mind of nightmarish visions, though there's no solid evidence of such an event ever occurring.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Aberration](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11)): DC 33\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 31\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 28\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 11\">[Howling Spawn](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1724)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Rare\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=137\" />\r\n<trait label=\"CE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Aberration\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=1\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Monsters of Myth](/Sources.aspx?ID=107) pg. 23</row>\n\n**Perception** +21; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), fear scent 60 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Aklo](/Languages.aspx?ID=13)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +22, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +19, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +23, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +21, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +19\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +7\r\n\r\n**Dex** +6\r\n\r\n**Con** +7\r\n\r\n**Int** +3\r\n\r\n**Wis** +4\r\n\r\n**Cha** +3\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Fear Scent** Howling spawn can sense [frightened](/Conditions.aspx?ID=19) creatures within 60 feet, using an incredibly accurate sense of psychic smell as a precise sense.\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 31 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +24 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +21 \r\n\r\n**Will** +18 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 175\r\n\r\n, regeneration [](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=26) 20 (deactivated by [cold](/Traits.aspx?ID=27))\r\n\r\n**Immunities**\r\n[emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=68)\r\n\r\n**Resistances**\r\n[fire](/Traits.aspx?ID=72) 15\r\n\r\n**Weaknesses**\r\n[cold](/Traits.aspx?ID=27) 10\r\n\r\n**[Frightful Presence](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=17)** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=68), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) 60 feet, DC 27<br />**Putrid Evanescence** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> **Frequency** once per hour; **Trigger** The howling spawn is damaged by another creature; **Effect** The howling spawn bursts into a cloud of putrid smoke, ash, and nightmares, becoming [invisible](/Conditions.aspx?ID=26) and teleporting up to 30 feet away to an unoccupied space it can see.
