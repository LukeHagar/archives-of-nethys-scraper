Whether in life a ravenous murderer hacked them to bits for stew, a werewolf tore them limb from limb, or they simply succumbed to the elements and became worm meat, derghodaemons seek to inflict the same twisted and bloody ends upon any they come across. Unlike some daemons, derghodaemons derive little pleasure from prolonged deaths—to these fiends, the quicker they can enact a gory demise, the sooner they can turn their attentions to their next victim and repeat the violent cycle.\n\nDerghodaemons look like walking masses of razor-sharp insect claws connected to equally menacing chitinous limbs, but few linger on their appearance for long— the gaze of a derghodaemon is enough to cause others in the vicinity to experience severe visual warping. The derghodaemon's appearance becomes more and more twisted as those who stare at it experience vicious hallucinations and ravenous urges to inflict harm on and devour others. Perhaps the most horrific attack derghodaemons can unleash upon their victims, though, is their swarming infestation—the daemons cough up a crawling, buzzing cloud of ravenous insects that cling to those targeted and chew them to death, provided the mind-numbing, half-whispered threats made by the rasp of the insects' bodies don't drive them to violent fury first!\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Fiend](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 30\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 28\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 25\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Daemon_Derghodaemon.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 12\">[Derghodaemon](/Monsters.aspx?ID=594)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Daemon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=213\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fiend\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=70\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 59 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +24; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), [scent (imprecise) 60 feet](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=33)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Daemonic](/Languages.aspx?ID=31); [telepathy 100 feet](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=37)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +22, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +25, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +24, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +24\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +7\r\n\r\n**Dex** +6\r\n\r\n**Con** +5\r\n\r\n**Int** +1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +6\r\n\r\n**Cha** +6\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 33 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +21 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +24 \r\n\r\n**Will** +22 \r\n\r\n+1 status to all saves vs. magic\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 240\n\n**Immunities**\r\n[confusion](/Conditions.aspx?ID=5), [death](/Traits.aspx?ID=40) effects, [swarm](/Traits.aspx?ID=239) attacks\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\ngood 10\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 35 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nclaw +25 ([deadly 1d12](/Traits.aspx?ID=174), [Evil](/Traits.aspx?ID=64), [Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 3d8+10 slashing plus 1d6 evil\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nswarm spit +25 ([Evil](/Traits.aspx?ID=64), [Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [range 60 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=248)),\r\n**Damage** 2d6+13 piercing plus 1d6 evil\r\n\r\n**Divine Innate Spells** DC 32\r\n- **1st**\r\n[Detect Alignment](/Spells.aspx?ID=65) (good only; at will)\r\n- **4th**\r\n[Dimension Door](/Spells.aspx?ID=69) (at will)\r\n- **5th**\r\n[Dimension Door](/Spells.aspx?ID=69)\r\n- **6th**\r\n[Blade Barrier](/Spells.aspx?ID=24), [Feeblemind](/Spells.aspx?ID=112) (×3)\r\n\r\n**Derghodaemon's Stare** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([Divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [Emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [Enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61), [Incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=93), [Mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [Visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=163)) A non-evil target must succeed at a DC 32 Will save or become [confused](/Conditions.aspx?ID=5) for 1 round, or 1 minute on a critical failure.
