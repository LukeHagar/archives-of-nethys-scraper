Their hollow thorns quickly siphon blood, which is how these carnivorous plants feed, and they rapidly turn consumed blood into fresh batches of delicious berries. Drainberry bushes exude a faint white glow that is a result of stored positive energy.\n\nDrainberry bushes exhibit unusually high intelligence and have an astute sense of value. They typically become insulted when creatures attempt to harvest their berries. Creatures that attempt to converse with drainberry bushes finds the plants telepathically convey only short and simple phrases: most commonly, “Money please,” “Deal good,” “Deal no good,” “Want that,” (with a gesture toward an item it covets), “Thank you, customer,” and if necessary, “No refunds.” Though a drainberry bush considers the market value of its berries to be 25 gp, it greatly prefers interesting art objects as payment—even ones of significantly lower value.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Plant](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 25\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 23\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 20\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/DrainberryBush.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 7\">[Drainberry Bush](/Monsters.aspx?ID=639)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Plant\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=125\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 99 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +16; [lifesense 120 feet](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=21)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Aklo](/Languages.aspx?ID=13), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Sylvan](/Languages.aspx?ID=10); can't speak any language; [telepathy 100 feet](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=37)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +11, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +17, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +13, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +17, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +11\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +6\r\n\r\n**Dex** +2\r\n\r\n**Con** +6\r\n\r\n**Int** -2\r\n\r\n**Wis** +4\r\n\r\n**Cha** +2\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Nature Empathy** The drainberry bush can use [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) to [Make an Impression](/Actions.aspx?ID=50) on and make very simple [Requests](/Actions.aspx?ID=51) of animals and plant creatures.\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 23 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +17 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +13 \r\n\r\n**Will** +13 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 135\n\n**Resistances**\r\nnegative 10\r\n\r\n**Weaknesses**\r\nfire 5\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 25 feet, climb 20 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nvine +17 ([reach 20 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 2d8+10 bludgeoning plus [Improved Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=27)\n\n**Blood Berries**   The drainberry bush must drain blood from living creatures for sustenance.
