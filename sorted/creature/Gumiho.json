The green-eyed canids use brutally sharp fangs to tear out their victim's throat and feast on their liver. Those few who survive a gumiho's trap recall the canid's eerie green eyes as well as a strange marble amulet warn around the monster's neck.\n\n Old stories claim that a fox transforms into a gumiho once it has lived for a thousand years, quadrupling in size, growing eight additional tails, and gaining the power to change shape. Terrifyingly, it also gains an insatiable hunger for the livers of people. This hunger is so closely connected to a gumiho's power that if it abstains from eating liver for one thousand days, the gumiho loses its magic and permanently takes on its humanoid guise—also losing its evil nature in the process.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Fey](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 38\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 36\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 33\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Gumiho.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 17\">[Gumiho](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1413)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"CE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fey\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=69\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #168: King of the Mountain](/Sources.aspx?ID=87) pg. 81</row>\n\n**Perception** +29; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), [scent](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=33) (imprecise) 60 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Sylvan](/Languages.aspx?ID=10)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +30, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +33, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +33, [Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14) +28, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +30\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +4\r\n\r\n**Dex** +8\r\n\r\n**Con** +5\r\n\r\n**Int** +6\r\n\r\n**Wis** +6\r\n\r\n**Cha** +9\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Guileful Charm** ([emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61), [incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=93), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120)) Any creature that converses with a gumiho must attempt a DC 35 Will save.
