When unable to locate buried remains, ba'aupa mdoudus are drawn reluctantly to the surface in search of bones from the living; living bones can sustain a ba'aupa mdoudu, but the flavor (particularly the temperature of warm bones fresh from the flesh) unsettles them a bit.\n\n Ba'aupa mdoudus produce a slimy acid that liquefies minerals, allowing them to burrow though even solid stone and strip natural deposits of calcium from nearby rocks. In doing so, they leave smooth tunnels in their wake. When provoked, ba'aupa mdoudus secrete this acid through numerous pores along their length as a defensive response and accelerate this secretion under extreme circumstances.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Beast](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2), [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 31\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 29\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 26\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/BaaupaMdoudu.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 13\">[Ba'aupa Mdoudu](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1661)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Beast\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=20\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #172: Secrets of the Temple City](/Sources.aspx?ID=102) pg. 80</row>\n\n**Perception** +23; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), skeleton sense 60 feet, tremorsense (imprecise) 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\n\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +27, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +25\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +8\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +5\r\n\r\n**Int** -4\r\n\r\n**Wis** +4\r\n\r\n**Cha** -2\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Skeleton Sense** A ba'aupa mdoudu can sense the presence of bones and skeletons within 60 feet; this is a precise sense when detecting dead bones but an imprecise one when detecting living bones.\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 33 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +26 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +21 \r\n\r\n**Will** +23 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 245\n\n**Immunities**\r\n[acid](/Traits.aspx?ID=3)\r\n\r\n**Resistances**\r\nbludgeoning 15\n\n**Reactive** A ba'aupa mdoudu gains an additional reaction at the start of its turn but can use this reaction only to Slime Squirt.<br />**Slime Squirt** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> **Trigger** A creature infiicts slashing or piercing damage on the ba'aupa mdoudu with a melee Strike; **Efiect** The attacking creature takes 2d10 acid damage.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 30 feet, burrow 20 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njaws +27 ([deadly d12](/Traits.aspx?ID=174)),\r\n**Damage** 3d8+14 piercing plus 1d10 [persistent acid](/Conditions.aspx?ID=29)\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nspit +23 ([Acid](/Traits.aspx?ID=3), [range increment 60 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=248)),\r\n**Damage** 6d6 acid\n\n**Caustic Acid**   Whenever a creature takes acid damage from any of a ba'aupa mdoudu's abilities or Strikes, it must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or become [drained 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=10) (drained 2 on a critical failure).
