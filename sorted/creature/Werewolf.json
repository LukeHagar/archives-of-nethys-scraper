Werewolves tend to dwell on the fringes of society or in small settlements where, in their humanoid forms, they work as laborers, hunters, farmers, or trappers. At night, however, these same villagers transform into violent killers and sadistic stalkers who prey on their neighbors. Werewolves are the quintessential werecreature, and the first that comes to mind when most people speak of such beings.\n\n Although most werewolves hide their curse by adopting solitary lifestyles, some retain the pack mentality of true wolves. A small group of such werewolves typically forms a family-like pack, with the eldest or most powerful serving as the leader; new pack mates are hand-chosen and inculcated into the family as its influence grows.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Beast](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2), [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 18\r\n\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 18\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 16\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 13\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Werecreature_Werewolf.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 3\">[Werewolf](/Monsters.aspx?ID=411)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"CE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Beast\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=20\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Human\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=90\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Werecreature\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=243\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 330</row>\n\n**Perception** +9; low-light vision, scent (imprecise) 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1); wolf empathy\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +7, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +9, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +10\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +4\r\n\r\n**Dex** +2\r\n\r\n**Con** +2\r\n\r\n**Int** -1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +2\r\n\r\n**Cha** +1\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Wolf Empathy** ([divination](/Traits.aspx?ID=47), [primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=134)) The werewolf can communicate with lupines.\r\n\r\n**Items**\r\n[Studded Leather Armor](/Armor.aspx?ID=5), [Composite Shortbow](/Weapons.aspx?ID=75) (20 arrows)\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 19 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +11 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +9 \r\n\r\n**Will** +7 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 63\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\nsilver 5\r\n\r\n**Attack of Opportunity** <actions string=\"Reaction\" />\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 25 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nbattle axe +11 ([Sweep](/Traits.aspx?ID=194)),\r\n**Damage** 1d8+8 slashing\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nclaw +11 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170)),\r\n**Damage** 1d6+8 slashing\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njaws +11,\r\n**Damage** 1d8+8 piercing plus curse of the werewolf\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\ncomposite shortbow +9 ([deadly 1d10](/Traits.aspx?ID=174), [range increment 60 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=248), [reload 0](/Traits.aspx?ID=254)),\r\n**Damage** 1d6+4 piercing\n\n**[Change Shape](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=8)** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([Concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32), [Polymorph](/Traits.aspx?ID=127), [Primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=134), [Transmutation](/Traits.aspx?ID=157)) Human with fist +11 for 1d4+8 bludgeoning, or wolf with Speed 40 feet and jaws with Knockdown.\r\n\r\n**Curse of the Werewolf**  ([Curse](/Traits.aspx?ID=38), [Necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117), [Primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=134)) This curse affects only humanoids. **Saving Throw** DC 19 Fortitude save.
