The cycle of blossoming, flourishing, and wilting that cherry trees exhibit provides a striking visual metaphor for toshigami, who wield immense powers over growth, decay, and even time.\n\n Also known as blossom kami, toshigami have a particular fascination with mortals. Many folk legends tell of toshigami who bestow their blessing unto worthy individuals who fight for just causes. Likewise, it isn't unheard of for toshigami to aid virtuous souls in dire need of healing or restoration. In truth, blossom kami are so rare and enigmatically aloof that few mortals have ever encountered such beings. Decades, even centuries, might pass before a humble village realizes that a toshigami inhabits its beloved cherry tree.\n\n The stories persist, however, as they have for ages, leading to a widespread appreciation for cherry trees. The site of a new village might be chosen due to its proximity to an ancient cherry tree, and cherry trees are planted and carefully tended in larger population centers, both for their beauty and out of respect for the blossom kami. Should a toshigami choose one such tree as their ward, so much the better for the entire community.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Spirit](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11)): DC 39\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 37\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 34\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Kami_Toshigami.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 15\">[Toshigami](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1204)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Rare\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=137\" />\r\n<trait label=\"NG\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Kami\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=354\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Spirit\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=149\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 3](/Sources.aspx?ID=66) pg. 145</row>\n\n**Perception** +30; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1); [_speak with plants_](/Spells.aspx?ID=294), [telepathy](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=37) 150 feet\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +30, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +31, [Medicine](/Skills.aspx?ID=9) +28, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +30, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +28, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +30\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +5\r\n\r\n**Dex** +7\r\n\r\n**Con** +6\r\n\r\n**Int** +2\r\n\r\n**Wis** +7\r\n\r\n**Cha** +8\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Ward** ([abjuration](/Traits.aspx?ID=2), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48)) Every kami is bound to a ward: a specific animal, plant, object, or location.
