The aptly named vaultbreaker oozes exhibit a mindless compulsion to feed on and digest precious metals. When near precious metals, the ichor exuded from their metallic plasm tarnishes black and forms small, jagged crystals that dot the oozes' surface. Like a strange biological compass, these crystals point vaultbreaker oozes to their next meal.\n\n Though mindless, these strange oozes exhibit an innate instinct for picking and bypassing locks to reach their meals by inserting a gelatinous pseudopod into a keyhole and then hardening the appendage into solid metal, forming a tool similar to a skeleton key.\n\n Vaultbreaker oozes can often be found in cities where tectonic instability has created fissures and cracks, allowing them to infiltrate basements, vaults, and underground chambers that may contain treasure. When rumors of vaultbreaker ooze sightings surface, banker consortiums, Abadaran priests, and even local thieves guilds offer hefty sums to have the dangerous oozes destroyed—though some might instead offer a bounty for their capture.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Ooze](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11)): DC 24\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 22\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 19\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Ooze_VaultbreakerOoze.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 6\">[Vaultbreaker Ooze](/Monsters.aspx?ID=997)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Mindless\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=108\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Ooze\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=122\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #158: Sixty Feet Under](/Sources.aspx?ID=47) pg. 87</row>\n\n**Perception** +10; motion sense 60 feet, treasure sense (imprecise) 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\n\n**Skills**\r\n[Thievery](/Skills.aspx?ID=17) +17\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +4\r\n\r\n**Dex** +2\r\n\r\n**Con** +7\r\n\r\n**Int** -5\r\n\r\n**Wis** +0\r\n\r\n**Cha** -5\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Motion Sense** A vaultbreaker ooze can sense nearby motion through vibration and air movement.<br />**Treasure Sense** The vaultbreaker ooze's metallic plasm alerts it to the presence of metals with the [precious](/Traits.aspx?ID=131) trait (including gold and platinum) within 30 feet.\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 13 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +17 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +10 \r\n\r\n**Will** +8 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 150\n\n**Immunities**\r\n[acid](/Traits.aspx?ID=3), critical hits, [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), precision, [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38), [visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=163)\n\n**Metallify** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> ([manipulate](/Traits.aspx?ID=104), [polymorph](/Traits.aspx?ID=127), [transmutation](/Traits.aspx?ID=157)) **Trigger** A creature Strikes the vaultbreaker ooze; **Effect** The ooze's outer plasm hardens into a protective shell of precious metals.
