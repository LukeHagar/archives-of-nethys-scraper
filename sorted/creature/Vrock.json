Their hatred for mortals is matched only by their desire to inflict suffering through their horrible screech or their devastating dance. Vrocks form from the souls of hateful mortals who are thus given another chance to inflict their rage on the world.\n\n Vrocks often travel in small groups so as to make the best use of their dance of ruin ability, but they rarely appear in groups larger than four. Against small groups and individuals, they swoop down without fear, hoping to play with their prey before going for the kill. Against formidable foes, they are just as happy to fly above, using their dance of ruin to cast a storm of lightning down on them.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Fiend](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 26\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 24\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 21\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Demon_Vrock.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 9\">[Vrock](/Monsters.aspx?ID=100)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"CE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Demon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=42\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fiend\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=70\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 78</row>\n\n**Perception** +18; darkvision\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Abyssal](/Languages.aspx?ID=12), [Celestial](/Languages.aspx?ID=16), [Draconic](/Languages.aspx?ID=2); telepathy 100 feet\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +18, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +18, [Performance](/Skills.aspx?ID=12) +18, [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13) +18, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +18, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +16\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +6\r\n\r\n**Dex** +3\r\n\r\n**Con** +5\r\n\r\n**Int** +2\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** +3\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 28 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +20 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +18 \r\n\r\n**Will** +15 \r\n\r\n+1 status to all saves vs. magic\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 185\n\n**Resistances**\r\n[electricity](/Traits.aspx?ID=56) 10\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\ncold iron 10, good 10\r\n\r\n**Attack of Opportunity** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> If the vrock is flying and a creature triggers an attack of opportunity, the vrock can make 2 Strikes with its talons against that creature instead of 1 Strike.<br /> **Peace Vulnerability** A vrock’s wrath is the heart of their essence, and forcing peace upon them wrenches at their soul.

If more vrocks within 30 feet want to join the dance, the vrock can delay the dance to wait for more vrocks; in that case, the effect occurs after the last vrock uses Dance of Ruin or one of the vrocks chooses to complete that round of the dance. Each non-demon creature in a 20-foot emanation from any of the dancing vrocks takes 2d12 electricity damage (DC 28 basic Reflex save). For each additional vrock that joins the dance, the damage increases by 1d12 and the save DC increases by 1 (to a maximum of four vrocks dealing 5d12 damage with a DC 31 save). The vrocks can continue dancing by using Dance of Ruin each round, for up to 3 rounds in total.

The vines cease growing after 10 rounds, and they wither away in 1d4 days if not shaved off before then. The vines can be destroyed if the creature is affected by a good spell or if _holy water_ is applied to the vines (with an Interact action).
