Many veiled masters are even more powerful than the typical specimen presented here and can use a wide range of arcane or occult spells and rituals. While veiled masters command significant combat prowess and impressive magical skills, the greatest danger they pose to others is their uncanny ability to infiltrate into societies much different than their own. The most paranoid of adventurers and conspiracy scholars worry that every major city has been infested by secret cabals of vidileths, while others dismiss this as hogwash and fearmongering.

Consume Memories (Mental, Occult) When a veiled master makes a fangs Strike against a creature, it can consume some of that creature’s memories.

When a veiled master consumes memories, it learns some of the creature’s memories (subject to the GM’s discretion).
