An individual venture-captain has overcome numerous challenges, and each has countless stories to tell—and the scars to go with them. Each venture-captain maintains a lodge somewhere in the Inner Sea, where Pathfinder agents can rest, share stories, and set out on new missions. The venture-captain assigns these missions themselves, and they can draw on the significant resources of the Pathfinder Society—as well as any local allies they have—to ensure the missions' success.\n\n This venture-captain operates a lodge that also serves as a tavern. His interest in epic tales led him to join the Society, and he gladly shares these stories with interested parties. Opportunistic field agents can gain the venture-captain's favor by recovering unique and valuable liquors.
