Balisses prefer to guide people to their own decisions rather than demand obedience to a higher cause, as intrinsic belief is even more powerful than blind obedience. While most balisses are fundamentally honest, they use their guardian angel ability to seem less intimidating and decrease the chance the mortal will simply acquiesce to the opinion of an obviously divine being. Balisses often form from souls of those who performed evil acts but were redeemed. Many serve the goddess Sarenrae, but they can serve other good deities and empyreal lords as well.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Celestial](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 24\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 22\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 19\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Angel_Balisse.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 8\">[Balisse](/Monsters.aspx?ID=15)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"NG\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Angel\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=8\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Celestial\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=23\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 18</row>\n\n**Perception** +18; (+20 to detect lies and illusions); darkvision\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Celestial](/Languages.aspx?ID=16), [Draconic](/Languages.aspx?ID=2), [Infernal](/Languages.aspx?ID=19); [_tongues_](/Spells.aspx?ID=340)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +14, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +17, [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13) +18\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +5\r\n\r\n**Dex** +2\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** +1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +6\r\n\r\n**Cha** +5\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n_+1 [striking](/Equipment.aspx?ID=280) [scimitar](/Weapons.aspx?ID=38)_\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 26 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +16 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +12 \r\n\r\n**Will** +18 \r\n\r\n+1 status to all saves vs. magic\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 145\n\n**Resistances**\r\n[fire](/Traits.aspx?ID=72) 15\r\n\r\n**Weaknesses**\r\nevil 10\r\n\r\n**Confessor’s Aura** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) 20 feet.
