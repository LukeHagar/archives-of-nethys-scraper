They care little for either good or evil. As they are both opinionated and willing to impose their sense of order on others, many brine dragons eventually seek to rule over a meticulously crafted community. These communities are orderly and well-planned, with rigid standards of courtesy and unchanging laws set down by the dragon themself. A settlement seeded by a brine dragon can be made of members of almost any ancestry, but the most common inhabitants are humans, merfolk, tengus, or sahuagin.\n\nDepending on the dragon's personality, their community members might view their brine dragon ruler as anything from a benevolent force of order to a fearful tyrant. Regardless, the typical brine dragon has little patience for kindness or philanthropy, and the strength and health of their settlement as a whole are of greater concern than individuals' well-being. A notable exception to this dispassion rises when an outside force encroaches on their lands. In these cases, the brine dragon is quick to step in and aid in the defense of their community.\n\nAlthough brine dragons enjoy cultivating settlements, they rarely make their lairs within the city limits, instead preferring to dwell in sea caves or cliffside grottoes overlooking the coastline. Here they can retreat for privacy as needed, or can accumulate and display their gathered wealth in a place where they feel safe spreading out their treasures. Brine dragon hoards often consist of a mix of offerings and taxes paid by those they rule over and strange discoveries salvaged from sunken ships.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Dragon](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2)): DC 41\r\n\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Elemental](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2), [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 41\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 39\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 36\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/DragonBrine.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 17\">[Ancient Brine Dragon](/Monsters.aspx?ID=623)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Rare\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=137\" />\r\n<trait label=\"LN\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Gargantuan\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Amphibious\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=207\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Dragon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=50\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Elemental\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=57\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Water\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=165\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 88 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +32; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), [scent (imprecise) 60 feet](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=33)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Aquan](/Languages.aspx?ID=14), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Draconic](/Languages.aspx?ID=2), [Sylvan](/Languages.aspx?ID=10), [Utopian](/Languages.aspx?ID=36)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +28, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +32, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +32, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +34, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +30, [Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14) +30, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +29\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +9\r\n\r\n**Dex** +5\r\n\r\n**Con** +6\r\n\r\n**Int** +5\r\n\r\n**Wis** +5\r\n\r\n**Cha** +6\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 40 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +31 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +30 \r\n\r\n**Will** +30 \r\n\r\n+1 status to all saves vs. magic\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 330\n\n**Immunities**\r\nacid, [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [sleep](/Traits.aspx?ID=145)\n\n**[Frightful Presence](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=17)** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=68), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) 90 feet, DC 36<br />**Brine Spit** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> **Trigger** A creature the brine dragon observes within 30 feet uses a [concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32) action; **Effect** The dragon spits a glob of caustic salt water at the creature.
