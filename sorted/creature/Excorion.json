Cults of undeath typically punish apostates and renegades with this cruel method of reanimation, though sacrificial victims or unfortunate prisoners might suffer a similar fate. Excorions have supernaturally strong, pulsing veins that extend outward from their bodies like thousands of tiny, bloody cilia.\n\n Excorions move their bulks not with their dead muscles but with heaving contractions of their blood vessels, which pull them along in a swift but jerky manner. Excorions can shift their magical blood easily throughout their bodies, allowing them to squirt blood from their gaping, skinless mouths or to messily mark their foes.\n\n Most excorions are so broken by the process of their creation that they retain few memories of their past lives or identities.
