To survive in such harsh conditions, the yaiafineti, or dusk poppy, sprouts independent polyps that detach and then creep across the tundra in search of food for their matriarch.\n\n Dusk poppies sprout from spores that attach to carcasses, but they only blossom during the long twilight unique to the Crown of the World. The perfect conditions for their development are so rare that yaiafineti have developed a vigorous appetite. They feed unceasingly. Much of their energy goes to developing more polyps, and one plant can easily spawn a small infestation of these deadly bulbs.\n\n The plants send out runner shoots that quickly develop purple bulbs. These bulbs, the plant's polyps, sprout many long, hooked vines before detaching from the mother plant. Polyps are short lived but active, foraging for a week or so before they shrivel and die. These polyps aren't dangerous unless handled. They secrete a fine dust that acts as a paralyzing poison that seizes the nervous system of creatures who come in contact with them.\n\n **Paralyzing Poison** (poison) **Saving Throw** DC 19 Fortitude; **Maximum Duration** 6 rounds; **Stage 1** [flat-footed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=16) and [clumsy 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=3) (1 round); **Stage 2** flat-footed and clumsy 2 (1 round); **Stage 3** [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28) (1 round)\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Plant](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 26\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 24\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 21\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Yaiafineti.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 8\">[Yaiafineti](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2504)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Mindless\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=108\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Plant\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=125\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #189: Dreamers of the Nameless Spires](/Sources.aspx?ID=195) pg. 87</row>\n\n**Perception** +16; pheromones (precise) 20 feet, [tremorsense](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=40) (imprecise) 120 feet, no vision\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\npheromones\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +18, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +7\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +6\r\n\r\n**Dex** -5\r\n\r\n**Con** +6\r\n\r\n**Int** -5\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** +0\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 24 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +19 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +11 \r\n\r\n**Will** +13 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 170\n\n**Immunities**\r\n[mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=163)\r\n\r\n**Resistances**\r\n[cold](/Traits.aspx?ID=27) 10\r\n\r\n**Weaknesses**\r\n[fire](/Traits.aspx?ID=72) 5, slashing 5\r\n\r\n**Pheromones** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206)) 5 miles.
