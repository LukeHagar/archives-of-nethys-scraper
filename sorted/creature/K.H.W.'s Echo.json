If his rope dart is lost or broken, he can re-form it with an Interact action. If he critically succeeds at a rope dart Strike, overwhelming thoughts and figments flow down the thread into the target's mind.

Regardless of whether his attack hits, he then retrieves the weapon.\r\n\r\n**Contingency Oathday-Nine-Rova** <actions string=\"Free Action\" />  **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** The Echo's turn begins and he's [stunned](/Conditions.aspx?ID=36), [slowed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=35), [confused](/Conditions.aspx?ID=5), [controlled](/Conditions.aspx?ID=6), [immobilized](/Conditions.aspx?ID=24), [grabbed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=20), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [restrained](/Conditions.aspx?ID=33), or otherwise can't act; **Effect** The Echo has set up numerous contingencies in the event he's compromised. Talismans on his body shatter, counteracting the triggering effect. The Echo can use this free action even if he can't act.\r\n\r\n**Reconstitute from Thought** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([Necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117), [Healing](/Traits.aspx?ID=89)) **Requirements** The Echo is standing on one of the eight large islands of the map, and the island hasn't darkened; **Effect** The Echo throws his rope dart into the island and uses it to absorb mental essence from the mindscape, repairing himself. He regains 45 Hit Points and the island turns a desaturated gray for 1 day, preventing future absorption and disabling the [call of the void](/Hazards.aspx?ID=196) hazard on that island.\r\n\r\n**Spindle's Web** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" />  The Echo's spindle revolves faster and faster until it's a blur, lashing red threads in every direction. The threads deal 7d6 slashing damage and 7d6 mental damage to all creatures in a 30-foot emanation, with a DC 34 [basic](/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Reflex save. If a creature fails its save, the threads awaken the mindscape anchor within it, affecting it differently based on which anchor that creature used to gain access to the center of the mindscape. (If there is a PC who didn't absorb a mindscape anchor, for instance because there are more than four PCs in the party, then use the anchor of the PC closest to them.) The Echo then can't use Spindle's Web for 1d4 rounds. \n<ul><li>**Lantern** The lantern outlines the creature with searing [_faerie fire_](/Spells.aspx?ID=107) that deals 2d6 [persistent fire damage](/Conditions.aspx?ID=29).</li><li>**Mirror** The mirror reflects the creature to another location, teleporting them to a clear space within 25 feet of their current location.</li><li>**Chalice** The chalice drains life force, granting the Echo temporary HP equal to half the damage dealt.</li><li>**Tome** The tome floods the creature's mind with information; the target is [slowed 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=35) for 1 round.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n</column>",
