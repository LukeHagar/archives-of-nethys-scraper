They are highly territorial and roam the highland moors they call home, constantly on the hunt for any creatures that might intrude on their territory. Those that bargain for safe passage to or from a portal find cu siths to be vigilant escorts that keep travelers safe from extraplanar threats but also ensure their charges don’t veer from the most direct path to their destination. Cu siths are highly proficient hunters, and to mortals they offer a single warning in the form of their terrifying bark. Creatures that refuse to flee upon hearing a cu sith’s warning bark risk a quick and brutal death.\n\n Cu siths cut imposing figures; they are as large as bulls and covered in intertwining roots, plant matter, and shaggy green and white fur that terminates in a long, plaited tail. Their eyes glow with a fiery green light.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Fey](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 25\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 23\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 20\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/CuSith.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 7\">[Cu Sith](/Monsters.aspx?ID=519)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fey\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=69\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #153: Life's Long Shadows](/Sources.aspx?ID=29) pg. 79</row>\n\n**Perception** +16; low-light vision, scent (imprecise) 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Sylvan](/Languages.aspx?ID=10); can't speak any language\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +15, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +17, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +17, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +16\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +6\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** -3\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** +5\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 24 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +15 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +17 \r\n\r\n**Will** +16 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 140\n\n**Immunities**\r\n[fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=68)\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\ncold iron 5\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 40 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njaws +17,\r\n**Damage** 2d10+9 piercing plus Grab\n\n**Dooming Bark** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([Auditory](/Traits.aspx?ID=16), [Concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32), [Fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=68), [Mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [Necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117), [Primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=134)) Any creature within 200 feet of the cu sith that hears its Dooming Bark must attempt a DC 24 Will save.\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and immune to Dooming Bark for 24 hours.<br />\n**Success** The creature is [frightened](/Conditions.aspx?ID=19) 1.<br />\n**Failure** The creature is frightened 2.<br />\n**Critical Failure** The creature is frightened 3 and [fleeing](/Conditions.aspx?ID=17). <br />If a creature is already frightened when it fails a save against Dooming Bark, its frightened value increases by 1 and it becomes [doomed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=9) 1.
