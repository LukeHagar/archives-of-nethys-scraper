Mindmoppets feed on the latent telepathic energy of creatures. Even those with no apparent gift but with an active mind can sustain a mindmoppet for days. Such feeding is not invasive, and mindmoppets continually “graze” even while inactive.\n\n Mindmoppets are willing servants to anyone who concerns themselves with strenuous mental exercise. Their creator is usually an obvious first choice, and they serve them dutifully. However, they have only an academic understanding of good and evil, of ethics, or mortal limitations. They see service to their master's science as the ultimate standard by which they judge their actions or those of others. This can lead to conflict between them and their creator, especially if the master appears lax in their efforts to further their studies. To a mindmoppet, continuous learning is imperative.\n\n Mindmoppets appear to have some ability to see a short distance into the future, though this might only be that their innate interest for thought and cognition gives them a knack for anticipating the actions of others.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Ooze](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11)): DC 22\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 20\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 17\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Mindmoppet.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 5\">[Mindmoppet](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2503)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"LN\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Tiny\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Ooze\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=122\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #189: Dreamers of the Nameless Spires](/Sources.aspx?ID=195) pg. 86</row>\n\n**Perception** +12; mindsense (precise) 120 feet, no vision\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1); one other language; [telepathy](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=37) 100 feet\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +13, [Crafting](/Skills.aspx?ID=4) +14, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +11, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +11, [Medicine](/Skills.aspx?ID=9) +10, [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11) +14, [Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14) +14, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +13, [Thievery](/Skills.aspx?ID=17) +13\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +2\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +2\r\n\r\n**Int** +5\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** +2\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Mindsense** The mindmoppet senses the thoughts of intelligent creatures and builds a perception of reality from this information, allowing the mindmoppet to “see” as a precise sense.
