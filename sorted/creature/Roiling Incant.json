When magical accidents result in large-scale property damage and the loss of life, these forces sometimes take on lives of their own, forming a dangerous amalgamation of ongoing magical energy known as a roiling incant.\n\n A roiling incant's appearance depends on the type of magic it sprang forth from, though it always carries with it an echo of the destruction it has caused. A fiery evocation roiling incant might look like a storm of burning ashes echoing with the sounds of crackling timber, while a necromancy roiling incant could be mistaken for ghostly tendrils puppeteering shambling corpses. No matter what it looks like, a roiling incant roams mindlessly, attacking everything it encounters, heedless of further carnage it causes. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Roiling Incant Variations</title> Each roiling incant is tied to a magic tradition as well as to a school of magic, and thus each has the traits of that tradition and school. Its innate spells must come from that tradition and school of magic, and they are usually related to the accident that caused the roiling incant's creation. The additional damage from their Engulf ability also changes based on their innate cantrip. Variant roiling incants usually have one 4th-level spell, one 3rd-level spell, one 2nd-level spell, and a cantrip, just like the example roiling incant presented below.
