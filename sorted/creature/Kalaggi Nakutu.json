As a child there, Kalaggi learned that the stars told a story with her in the role as Bundasu's next keeper, the village's physical and spiritual protector. Kalaggi was quick to learn combat and hunting. Tapping into her spiritual side, however, was much more difficult. Rather than push the young girl and risk her losing confidence, the villagers focused her training in the areas she was already competent.\n\n Once she mastered her martial skills, Kalaggi set her sights on the spiritual once again. She ventured from Bundasu and joined the Magaambya. She believes that learning the ways of magic will allow her to better understand her own spirit. Kalaggi seeks to return to Bundasu with greater inner knowledge to fulfill her destiny.\n\n Kalaggi is careful with her words around others. She feels an almost sibling-like bond with Ufi, however, and speaks freely with him.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 25\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 23\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 20\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 1\">[Kalaggi Nakutu](/NPCs.aspx?ID=1751)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Unique\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=161\" />\r\n<trait label=\"LN\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Human\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=90\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Threshold of Knowledge](/Sources.aspx?ID=109) pg. 12</row>\n\n**Perception** +7\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Elven](/Languages.aspx?ID=4), [Mwangi](/Languages.aspx?ID=39)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +7, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +3, [Medicine](/Skills.aspx?ID=9) +5, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +5, [Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14) +4, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +7, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +5, [Tanning Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +4, [Thievery](/Skills.aspx?ID=17) +7\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +0\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +2\r\n\r\n**Int** +1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +2\r\n\r\n**Cha** +0\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n[Backpack](/Equipment.aspx?ID=4), [Climbing Kit](/Equipment.aspx?ID=14), [Dagger](/Weapons.aspx?ID=3), [minor elixir of life](/Equipment.aspx?ID=91), [Grappling Hook](/Equipment.aspx?ID=23), [Leather Armor](/Armor.aspx?ID=4), [Light Mace](/Weapons.aspx?ID=5), [Longbow](/Weapons.aspx?ID=76) (30 arrows), [Rope](/Equipment.aspx?ID=44), [Writing Set](/Equipment.aspx?ID=63), 9 sp\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 18 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +7 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +9 \r\n\r\n**Will** +5 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 21\n\n**[Attack of Opportunity](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=3)** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> \r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 25 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\ndagger +9 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179), [versatile S](/Traits.aspx?ID=200)),\r\n**Damage** 1d4 piercing\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nlight mace +9 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179), [Shove](/Traits.aspx?ID=193)),\r\n**Damage** 1d4 bludgeoning\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\ndagger +9 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [thrown 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=195), [versatile S](/Traits.aspx?ID=200)),\r\n**Damage** 1d4 piercing\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nlongbow +9 ([deadly d10](/Traits.aspx?ID=174), [range increment 100 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=248), [reload 0](/Traits.aspx?ID=254), [volley 30 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=201)),\r\n**Damage** 1d8 piercing\n\n**Point-Blank Shot** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([Open](/Traits.aspx?ID=123), [Stance](/Traits.aspx?ID=152)) **Requirements** Kalaggi is wielding a ranged weapon; **Effect** Kalaggi takes aim to pick off nearby enemies quickly.
