Desires granted by a glabrezu always come to fruition in the most destructive way possible, turning a wish or hope into a potent and devastating act of betrayal—although the long-term repercussions are not always immediately apparent. For example, a struggling weapon smith might wish for fame and skill at their craft, only to find that their best patron is a cruel and sadistic murderer who uses the weapons in bloody sprees. Or a lonely widower might have his desire granted in the form of a lost love returned to “life” as a vampire. Glabrezus are nothing if not creative in addressing a mortal’s needs.\n\n These massive demons have enormous pincers and a pair of smaller humanoid arms sprouting from their chests, but their size belies their skill at magic, and they possess formidable innate spells. Treachery demons arise from the souls of mortals engaged in treason and deception.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Fiend](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 31\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 29\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 26\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Demon_Glabrezu.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 13\">[Glabrezu](/Monsters.aspx?ID=101)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"CE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Huge\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Demon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=42\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fiend\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=70\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 79</row>\n\n**Perception** +24; darkvision, [_true seeing_](/Spells.aspx?ID=344)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Abyssal](/Languages.aspx?ID=12), [Celestial](/Languages.aspx?ID=16), [Draconic](/Languages.aspx?ID=2); telepathy 100 feet, [_tongues_](/Spells.aspx?ID=340)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +28, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +26, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +26, [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13) +22, [Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14) +22, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +21\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +7\r\n\r\n**Dex** +2\r\n\r\n**Con** +7\r\n\r\n**Int** +3\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** +7\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 34 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +26 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +19 \r\n\r\n**Will** +24 \r\n\r\n+1 status to all saves vs. magic\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 280\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\ncold iron 10, good 10\r\n\r\n**Truth Vulnerability** A glabrezu’s lies sustain them, and the truth can destroy them.
