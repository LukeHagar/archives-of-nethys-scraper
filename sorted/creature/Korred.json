While korreds have a natural affinity and admiration for stones and boulders, they prefer to dwell aboveground in areas of rocky forest or wooded hills rather than in caves. Korreds are a private people who don't take kindly to intruders, and they invariably work to drive off or kill any non-fey who stumble into their territory.
