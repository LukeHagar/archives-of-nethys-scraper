Once connected to such a being, the nightgaunt feeds upon the mortal's emotions before abandoning them—often in places they might never wake from.\n\n A nightgaunt appears as a bony humanoid with inky black skin, batlike wings, a long sinuous tail, and demonic horns atop a skull that lacks any face or features. Most nightgaunts have little interest in anything other than sating their hunger for emotions. They find the art of inducing nightmares to be a surefire way to feast, but they're even more adept at tormenting their victims to awful extremes through tickling while carrying them at precarious heights.\n\n Nightgaunts often gather in vast colonies in the [Dreamlands](/Planes.aspx?ID=22), where they entertain each other by sharing emotion-memories of their meals through strange caresses. These colonies pose great danger to any adventurer foolish enough to approach.\n\n When conjured forth into other worlds, they serve only grudgingly, often working as hard to find a way to escape servitude and feed on their conjurer's emotions as they do on the task they've been compelled to perform.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Aberration](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11)): DC 21\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 19\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 16\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Nightgaunt.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 4\">[Nightgaunt](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1247)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"CN\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Aberration\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=1\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Dream\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=299\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 3](/Sources.aspx?ID=66) pg. 186</row>\n\n**Perception** +10; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), thoughtsense (precise) 60 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Aklo](/Languages.aspx?ID=13); (can't speak any language)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +11, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +13, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +11\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +5\r\n\r\n**Dex** +3\r\n\r\n**Con** +2\r\n\r\n**Int** -2\r\n\r\n**Wis** +2\r\n\r\n**Cha** +0\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Thoughtsense** ([divination](/Traits.aspx?ID=47), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120)) A nightgaunt senses all non-[mindless](/Traits.aspx?ID=108) creatures at the listed range.\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 21 [all-around vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=1)\r\n\r\n**Fort** +10 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +13 \r\n\r\n**Will** +10 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 60\n\n**Resistances**\r\ncold 5\n\n**Faceless** The nightgaunt has no face, but it can still see in all directions as if its entire body were an eye.
