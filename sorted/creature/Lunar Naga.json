While they are less physically imposing than other nagas, they possess a graceful beauty that many find entrancing, even without the help of the naga's inherent magical abilities. Earning a lunar naga's trust is difficult, but not impossible, especially for someone who shares the creature's interest in the celestial sphere.\n\n As they have no hands, lunar nagas use [_mage hand_](/Spells.aspx?ID=177) to manipulate delicate instruments and fine telescopes to observe the night sky. They track the positions of celestial bodies, recording their discoveries in esoteric journals. At their best, lunar nagas are wise and mysterious beings who seek to expand their knowledge of the cosmos. At their worst, after too much exposure to the unfathomable entities that dwell in the darkness between the stars, they become dark prophets who drive others to commit terrible deeds in the name of abominable masters.\n\n On Golarion, the lunar nagas of the nation of Nagajor use their abilities to serve many communities as soothsayers. A few have founded observatories in which they and their followers explore the night sky. Some nagas even use their knowledge of the stars as navigators on ships or overland caravans. In the broader world, where people do not give nagas deference as nearly divine rulers, lunar nagas try to avoid contact with outsiders or use their magical powers of disguise to hide their true forms from all but their most worthy allies.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Aberration](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11)): DC 24\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 22\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 19\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Naga_LunarNaga.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 6\">[Lunar Naga](/Monsters.aspx?ID=736)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Aberration\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=1\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 178 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +16; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Aklo](/Languages.aspx?ID=13), [Celestial](/Languages.aspx?ID=16), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +14, [Astronomy Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +11, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +15, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +15, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +13, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +14\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +2\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** +1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +4\r\n\r\n**Cha** +3\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 24 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +15 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +16 \r\n\r\n**Will** +17 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 100\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 25 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nfangs +16 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179)),\r\n**Damage** 2d6+8 piercing plus lunar naga venom\r\n\r\n**Primal Spontaneous Spells** DC 24, attack +16\r\n- **Cantrips (3rd)**\r\n[Dancing Lights](/Spells.aspx?ID=58), [Daze](/Spells.aspx?ID=61), [Detect Magic](/Spells.aspx?ID=66), [Mage Hand](/Spells.aspx?ID=177), [Read Aura](/Spells.aspx?ID=246)\r\n- **1st**\r\n[Charm](/Spells.aspx?ID=34), [Fleet Step](/Spells.aspx?ID=122), [Heal](/Spells.aspx?ID=148), [Spider Sting](/Spells.aspx?ID=300) (4 slots)\r\n- **2nd**\r\n[Humanoid Form](/Spells.aspx?ID=153), [Glitterdust](/Spells.aspx?ID=136), [Invisibility](/Spells.aspx?ID=164), [Web](/Spells.aspx?ID=374) (4 slots)\r\n- **3rd**\r\n[Heal](/Spells.aspx?ID=148), [Lightning Bolt](/Spells.aspx?ID=172), [Slow](/Spells.aspx?ID=289) (4 slots)\r\n\r\n**Hypnosis** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([Concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32), [Enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61), [Incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=93), [Mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [Primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=134), [Visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=163)) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The lunar naga twists the coils of their serpentine body, causing the starlike motes on their scales to shift and move as they glow brighter, creating a mesmerizing swirl of light and darkness.
