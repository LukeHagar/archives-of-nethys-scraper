These rocky goliaths can tunnel through stone with their iron-sharp claws.<br /> Cavern trolls rarely venture to the surface world, for they have a debilitating vulnerability to sunlight that petrifies them on sustained contact. Unlike common trolls, cavern trolls can regenerate wounds dealt by fire. The crystalline nature of their skin, however, permits sonic attacks to neutralize their signature regeneration.<br /> As cavern trolls age, their flinty skin becomes studded with small crystals and stones of various composition. Paragons of their kind have toothy maws replete with large, crystalline fangs.
