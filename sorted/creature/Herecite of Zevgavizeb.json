These monsters, stripped of personal will or desire, are born into the service of an evil god whom they worship unerringly and untiringly, often in spite of any opposing religious leanings they may have had in life. Every herecite harbors an unquenchable self-hatred because it was defiled by such a foul resurrection—a rage it turns outward in an attempt to rob others of their faith and lives.\n\n Herecites often outlast the cults that create them. Stranded herecites are drawn to others of their kind, even if they are dedicated to different evil deities, and when brought together they perform rites to magically bind themselves in a group known as a cabal. While cabal members share enhanced magic and defenses, induction into a cabal appears to hold even deeper significance for herecites. The presence of others of their kind with whom they can pray—in verses warped to venerate wicked gods—seems the only solace these tormented beings can find in undeath. Such a fellowship of sorrow is nigh unbreakable, as many an overzealous crusader has discovered far too late.\n\n Customarily found within heavily modified temples to the pantheon of gods they collectively worship, herecites act in service to their creators or as protectors of unholy ground. High priests of different evil gods may even trade herecites among themselves, allowing their minions to form cabals strengthened by their varied faiths. A lone herecite cut off from its creators—often because it is the sole remnant of a destroyed temple or its master has perished—may wander far and wide in search of a cabal to join. Other times, the herecite seeks out a place sacred to the deity it worshipped in life. Whether motivated by a desire for contrition or vengeance, the end result of this baleful pilgrimage is always the desecration of the holy site and the slaughter of its congregants, who may in turn rise as lesser forms of undead.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Undead](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 29\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 27\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 24\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Herecite.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 10\">[Herecite of Zevgavizeb](/Monsters.aspx?ID=520)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"CE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Undead\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=160\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #153: Life's Long Shadows](/Sources.aspx?ID=29) pg. 80</row>\n\n**Perception** +20; darkvision, [_detect alignment_](/Spells.aspx?ID=65) (good only)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Draconic](/Languages.aspx?ID=2), [Infernal](/Languages.aspx?ID=19)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +20, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +23, [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13) +22, [Zevgavizeb Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +19\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +6\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +5\r\n\r\n**Int** +1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +4\r\n\r\n**Cha** +7\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Cabal** Multiple herecites can form a cabal to gain increased magical abilities and defenses. A cabal consists of two to five herecites. The ritual to form a cabal (or to welcome new herecites into an existing cabal) requires 24 hours of worship, prayer, and vile sacrifice, after which point the herecites become magically bound to one another. All herecites in a cabal gain the cleric domain spells granted by each individual herecite’s deity, and each herecite’s focus pool increases to 3 Focus Points. As long as the cabal exists, herecites in the cabal gain a +2 status bonus to Perception checks and fast healing 10. These benefits persist as long as the cabal consists of two or more herecites that remain within 1 mile of one another.<br /> **Herecite Deity** A herecite is associated with one evil god and is always of the same alignment as that god. Whenever it wields its deity’s favored weapon, that weapon gains the [_unholy_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=307) rune. The herecite’s creators select two domains from their deity; the herecite can cast the domain spells and the advanced domain spells from those domains as cleric focus spells. The herecite can cast the deity’s other granted cleric spells as divine innate spells. Most herecites have 2 Focus Points in their focus pool. The herecite presented here is a herecite of [Zevgavizeb](/Deities.aspx?ID=82).\r\n\r\n**Items**\r\n[_+1 striking spiked gauntlet_](/Weapons.aspx?ID=11)\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 30 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +19 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +20 \r\n\r\n**Will** +22 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 200\r\n([negative healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=42))\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\ngood 10\r\n\r\n**Perverse Prayer** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> ([auditory](/Traits.aspx?ID=16), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [evil](/Traits.aspx?ID=64)) **Trigger** A creature within 30 feet uses the Sustain a Spell action to sustain a divine spell or the Cast a Spell action to cast a divine spell with a verbal component; **Effect** The herecite warps the caster’s prayers into a sacrilegious echo praising the evils of its own deity.

The herecite targets one creature within 30 feet, which must attempt a DC 29 Will save. On a failure, the creature is cursed. As long as the creature is cursed, any art object, symbol, or implement of religious significance in the creature’s possession—such as a divine spellcasting focus, holy text, fetish, or rendering of a deity—becomes physically corrupted in a way that debases the deity’s tenets (a depiction of [Shelyn’s](/Deities.aspx?ID=17) songbird, for example, might lose its beautiful plumage to reveal a hideous skeletal form beneath). While these items continue to function normally, the cursed creature is [stupefied](/Conditions.aspx?ID=37) 2 as long as it possesses an object corrupted in this fashion. The creature can cast off its corrupted objects to remove the stupefied condition, but any new religious objects it takes into its possession become similarly corrupted. The curse can be lifted by a [_remove curse_](/Spells.aspx?ID=250) spell or by an [_atone_](/Rituals.aspx?ID=2) ritual. After a creature is targeted with this ability, regardless of whether it was affected, it becomes immune to herecites’ Curse of Defiled Idols for 1 day.\r\n\r\n</column>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"creature-family-120\" />",
