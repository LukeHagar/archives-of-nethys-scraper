These massive predatory beasts typically dwell in the deepest waters and compete with krakens and other monsters for food. They feed on whales and other large sea creatures, sometimes following them to the water’s surface. Near the surface, baomals that encounter ships quickly learn that they contain a variety of tasty morsels. The creatures use their devastating spikes to rip open the ships’ hulls, then leisurely feed on the helpless sailors.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Aberration](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11)): DC 40\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 38\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 35\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Baomal.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 20\">[Baomal](/Monsters.aspx?ID=40)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"CN\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Gargantuan\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Aberration\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=1\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Aquatic\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=168\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 35</row>\n\n**Perception** +34; darkvision, scent (imprecise) 80 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Aklo](/Languages.aspx?ID=13)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +41, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +31, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +37\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +10\r\n\r\n**Dex** +2\r\n\r\n**Con** +8\r\n\r\n**Int** -3\r\n\r\n**Wis** +6\r\n\r\n**Cha** +1\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 48 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +36 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +30 \r\n\r\n**Will** +34 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 315\n\n**Resistances**\r\nphysical 10\n\n**[All-Around Vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=1)**<br /> **[Attack of Opportunity](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=3)** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /><br /> **Double Opportunity** A baomal gains an extra reaction each round that it can use only to make an Attack of Opportunity.
