The toxic resin, which has a bitter taste, protects the tree from herbivorous insects and other animals, but in rare cases—usually in areas awash in positive energy or the influence of the First World—the sap gains a life of its own. Such “living sap” is a mindless ooze that attempts to smother and engulf just about anything that moves, from the bugs and small beasts that feed on its sharinga tree to larger creatures unlucky enough to stumble upon it. Due to its immunities to most forms of physical damage and its protectiveness of its mother tree, a living ooze is a nuisance to communities that rely on the sap of sharinga trees to make resin, rubber, and glue.\n\n Jungle-dwelling alchemists such as [gripplis](/Monsters.aspx?ID=447) cherish the sap of the sharinga tree for its unique adhesive properties. The sap has been used for centuries to create tanglefoot bags, glue, and hard resin. Residue collected from a living sap is even more fascinating from an alchemical standpoint. Though harvesting a living sap is very dangerous, some alchemists will risk death (if not their own, then that of hearty adventurers for hire) in order to procure these easily worked ingredients. To increase the odds of a successful harvest, such employers are often willing to supply offensive aids such as lesser frost vials; living sap hunters learned long ago that cold energy is effective against these creatures and luckily doesn’t harm the harvestable reagents.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Ooze](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11)): DC 24\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 22\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 19\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/LivingSap.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 6\">[Living Sap](/Monsters.aspx?ID=451)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Mindless\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=108\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Ooze\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=122\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #146: Cult of Cinders](/Sources.aspx?ID=7) pg. 89</row>\n\n**Perception** +7; motion sense 60 feet, no vision\r\n\r\n**Languages**\n\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +17, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +10\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +5\r\n\r\n**Dex** -3\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** -5\r\n\r\n**Wis** -5\r\n\r\n**Cha** -5\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Motion Sense** Living sap can sense nearby motion through vibration and air movement.\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 13 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +18 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +7 \r\n\r\n**Will** +5 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 175\n\n**Immunities**\r\ncritical hits, mental, piercing, precision, slashing, unconscious, visual\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\ncold 10\r\n\r\n**Adhesive Body** A creature that Strikes a living sap with a melee weapon must succeed at a DC 24 Reflex save or be disarmed of that weapon.
