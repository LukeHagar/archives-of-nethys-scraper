Living runes can also be crafted to deal different types of energy damage with their Strikes.\n\n **Divine**: Divine living runes are crafted by various churches and sects and typically bear the symbol of a deity, archdevil, or other divine force. Divine living runes replace [Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2) with [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13) and have the following innate spells. <br />**Divine Innate Spells** DC 35, attack +27; **7th** [_divine decree_](/Spells.aspx?ID=82) (×2); **6th** [_blade barrier_](/Spells.aspx?ID=24), [_glyph of warding_](/Spells.aspx?ID=138) (at will), [_repulsion_](/Spells.aspx?ID=254), [_spirit blast_](/Spells.aspx?ID=301); **5th** [_divine wrath_](/Spells.aspx?ID=86) (×2), [_flame strike_](/Spells.aspx?ID=120) \n\n**Occult**: These runes are crafted by unknown hands and often left in out-of-the-way places.
