These foul creatures collect souls in dark gems or crystalline jars to sell in fiendish markets, and are themselves empowered by potent magic jewels known as _heartstones_. They haunt the Ethereal Plane, where they prey upon mortals in their dreams, debilitating them with horrific nightmares as they rest. A night hag may find a particular target and haunt them continuously over the course of weeks, slowly and cruelly breaking down the victim’s will and ability to resist, until their soul is forfeit.\n\n A night hag is a canny mastermind and soul broker, willing to consider any deal as long as she is convinced she has the upper hand. Although a night hag finds it easy to travel the Ethereal Plane and prey upon helpless souls that can’t fight back, these souls are also the least desirable to the evil outsiders the night hag bargains with, and so a night hag gathers allies and minions that allow her to prey on more potent souls without personally risking herself. Their favored minions are nightmares, with whom they share a special bond. Above all, night hags avoid fighting foes that can harry them on the Ethereal Plane, picking fights only when they are certain they can escape.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Fiend](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 26\r\n\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 26\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 24\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 21\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Hag_NightHag.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 9\">[Night Hag](/Monsters.aspx?ID=257)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fiend\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=70\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Hag\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=84\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 202</row>\n\n**Perception** +18; darkvision\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Abyssal](/Languages.aspx?ID=12), [Aklo](/Languages.aspx?ID=13), [Celestial](/Languages.aspx?ID=16), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Infernal](/Languages.aspx?ID=19)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2) +18, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +18, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +18, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +14, [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11) +20, [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13) +20\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +5\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +6\r\n\r\n**Int** +4\r\n\r\n**Wis** +5\r\n\r\n**Cha** +3\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Coven** A night hag adds [_dominate_](/Spells.aspx?ID=87), [_nightmare_](/Spells.aspx?ID=208), [_scrying_](/Spells.aspx?ID=268), and [_spellwrack_](/Spells.aspx?ID=298) to her coven’s spells.<br />**Nightmare Rider** When a night hag rides a nightmare, the nightmare also gains the night hag’s status bonus to saves against magic, and both the hag and rider benefit when the night hag uses her _heartstone’s_ [_ethereal jaunt_](/Spells.aspx?ID=105) innate spell.\r\n\r\n**Items**\r\n[_heartstone_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=487)\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 28 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +19 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +17 \r\n\r\n**Will** +18 \r\n\r\n+2 status to all saves vs. magic, –2 to all saves if the night hag does not have her _heartstone_\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 170\n\n**Immunities**\r\nsleep\r\n\r\n**Resistances**\r\nmental 10\r\n\r\n**Weaknesses**\r\ncold iron 10\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 25 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njaws +20 ([Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103)),\r\n**Damage** 2d8+8 piercing plus 1d6 evil and Abyssal plague\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nclaw +20 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103)),\r\n**Damage** 2d10+8 slashing plus 1d6 evil\r\n\r\n**Occult Innate Spells** DC 28\r\n- **1st**\r\n[Ray of Enfeeblement](/Spells.aspx?ID=244) (at will), [Sleep](/Spells.aspx?ID=288) (at will)\r\n- **2nd**\r\n[Invisibility](/Spells.aspx?ID=164) (at will)\r\n- **3rd**\r\n[Dream Message](/Spells.aspx?ID=90) (at will), [Magic Missile](/Spells.aspx?ID=180) (at will)\r\n- **5th**\r\n[Nightmare](/Spells.aspx?ID=208), [Shadow Blast](/Spells.aspx?ID=273) (x2, from heartstone)\r\n- **8th**\r\n[Dream Council](/Spells.aspx?ID=89)\r\n- **9th**\r\n[Bind Soul](/Spells.aspx?ID=21) (at will; from heartstone), [Ethereal Jaunt](/Spells.aspx?ID=105) (at will; from heartstone)\r\n- **Constant (2nd)**\r\n[Detect Alignment](/Spells.aspx?ID=65) (all alignments simultaneously)\r\n- **Constant (3rd)**\r\n[Detect Magic](/Spells.aspx?ID=66)\r\n\r\n**Abyssal Plague**  ([Disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46)) A creature can’t recover from drained until abyssal plague is cured. **Saving Throw** DC 28 Fortitude; **Stage 1** [Drained 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=10) (1 day); **Stage 2** [Drained](/Conditions.aspx?ID=10) increases by 2 (1 day)\r\n\r\n**[Change Shape](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=8)** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([Concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32), [Occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120), [Polymorph](/Traits.aspx?ID=127), [Transmutation](/Traits.aspx?ID=157)) The night hag can take on the appearance of any Medium female humanoid.
