These spiritbound aluums are rarely used as peacekeepers, instead serving as assassins, elite bodyguards, or riot control during times of martial law.\n\n A spiritbound aluum has a dull blue crystalline focus that stores constituent souls, surrounded by a host of smaller gems used for trapping souls the Pactmasters wish to deny from entering the Great Beyond. Spiritbound aluums rarely use this soul-binding ability except when instructed by their masters. However, the murderous or embittered souls within the aluum sometimes exert control and willfully consume a departing soul either out of malice or to incorporate it into the construct’s core. If not relieved of its trapped souls in a timely manner, a spiritbound aluum can develop enough will to overcome its masters’ orders and even awaken to full sentience. These rogue aluums typically lose the [mindless](/Traits.aspx?ID=108) trait, are evil, have an Intelligence modifier of –2 or higher, and gain several skills with bonuses ranging from +25 to +32.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Construct](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2), [Crafting](/Skills.aspx?ID=4)): DC 40\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 38\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 35\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 16\">[Spiritbound Aluum](/Monsters.aspx?ID=477)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Rare\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=137\" />\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Construct\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=35\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Mindless\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=108\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Soulbound\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=237\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #149: Against the Scarlet Triad](/Sources.aspx?ID=14) pg. 83</row>\n\n**Perception** +28; darkvision\r\n\r\n**Languages**\n\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +33\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +9\r\n\r\n**Dex** +3\r\n\r\n**Con** +6\r\n\r\n**Int** -5\r\n\r\n**Wis** +4\r\n\r\n**Cha** -2\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 39 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +30 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +25 \r\n\r\n**Will** +28 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 255\n\n**Immunities**\r\nbleed, disease, death effects, doomed, drained, fatigued, magic (see below), mental, nonlethal attacks, paralyzed, poison, sickened, unconscious\r\n\r\n**Resistances**\r\n15 physical (except adamantine)\n\n**Attack of Opportunity**<actions string=\"Reaction\" />\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 25 feet, fly 25 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nfist +33 ([Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103)),\r\n**Damage** 3d10+17 bludgeoning plus paralyzing force\r\n\r\n**Arcane Innate Spells** DC 38\r\n- **5th**\r\n[Locate](/Spells.aspx?ID=173)\r\n- **9th**\r\n[Bind Soul](/Spells.aspx?ID=21) (x3)\r\n\r\n**Aluum Antimagic**   Spiritbound aluum are immune to spells and magical abilities, with two exceptions.
