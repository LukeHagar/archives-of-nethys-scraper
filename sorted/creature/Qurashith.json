These monstrosities are no mere beasts. A qurashith does not simply devour its victims; once it kills its prey, it physically subsumes the creature into its own body, metabolizing the prey’s spiritual essence. Close inspection of a qurashith reveals that its body is an amalgamation of the fiend and its extraplanar and mortal victims, bound together by webs of demonic scar tissue and sticky acidic pus. While the individual personalities of a qurashith’s victims gradually metabolize and diffuse into its very substance over time, a particularly charismatic or magically powerful victim might exert some influence over the qurashith’s mind for a short time.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Aberration](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11)): DC 41\r\n\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Fiend](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 41\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 39\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 36\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Qurashith.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 17\">[Qurashith](/Monsters.aspx?ID=532)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Rare\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=137\" />\r\n<trait label=\"CE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Huge\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Aberration\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=1\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fiend\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=70\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #154: Siege of the Dinosaurs](/Sources.aspx?ID=31) pg. 82</row>\n\n**Perception** +33; greater darkvision, scent (imprecise) 60 feet, [_true seeing_](/Spells.aspx?ID=344)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Abyssal](/Languages.aspx?ID=12); telepathy 120 feet, [_tongues_](/Spells.aspx?ID=340)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +30, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +32, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +29, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +32, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +28\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +9\r\n\r\n**Dex** +7\r\n\r\n**Con** +6\r\n\r\n**Int** -1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +5\r\n\r\n**Cha** +6\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 40 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +29 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +30 \r\n\r\n**Will** +28 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 340\n\n**Resistances**\r\nacid 15\r\n\r\n**Weaknesses**\r\ngood 15, lawful 15\r\n\r\n**Adhesive Body** Any creature that Strikes the qurashith with a melee weapon must attempt a DC 37 Reflex save.
