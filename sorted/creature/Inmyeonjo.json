While these stories are often dismissed as tall tales, the truth is much stranger, for the bird they've encountered not only has a human voice, but one a human face as well. Inmyeonjos are enormous white birds with flowing tails, abnormally long necks, and mask-like human faces. They wear an elongated black headpiece that serves as a vessel for their life energy, enabling their reincarnation through any living creature.\n\n Inmyeonjos often serve as gatekeepers or guardians of the tombs of great sages and leaders who brought peace to their lands and people. They can also be found atop on high mountains where the border between earth and sky is thinnest. Ultimately, inmyeonjos strive for balance and peace among all mortals.
