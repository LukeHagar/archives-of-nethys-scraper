Thick, white fur covers everywhere except his face, hands, and feet, which reveal darker skin beneath the fur, covered in an intricate pattern of stylized runes. Unlike other saumen kar, Ainamuuren possess not two but four long, curving horns, jutting from his head like a primal crown.

The prison is a sphere made of unmelting ice, just large enough to fit his target. The target, and any creatures sharing its space, must attempt a DC 34 Reflex save. A creature that fails becomes trapped inside the prison. If it succeeds, the creature is pushed outside the prison into a space of its choice. If the target shares its space with a gargantuan creature, the effect fails.\n\n The dome has AC 10, Hardness 20, and 40 Hit Points; and is immune to [cold](/Traits.aspx?ID=27), critical hits, and precision damage.
