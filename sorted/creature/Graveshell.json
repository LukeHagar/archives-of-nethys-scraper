Aside from its shell, the monster resembles no known animal. Small but bright yellow eyes watch from the sagging flesh of its head, the most prominent feature of which is a curiously shaped, toothy maw twisted into a perpetual grin. Its stubby arms and legs are impractical for both walking and swimming, though the algae-caked claws tipping each limb are deadly weapons.\n\n Graveshells are intelligent—a fact that surprises many who encounter them—and surrender rather than fight to the death. These monsters have little to offer in exchange for their lives, though the waterlogged treasures on their collection of corpses may entice opportunists.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Beast](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2), [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 17\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 15\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 12\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Graveshell.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 1\">[Graveshell](/Monsters.aspx?ID=436)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Beast\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=20\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #145: Hellknight Hill](/Sources.aspx?ID=4) pg. 89</row>\n\n**Perception** +4; darkvision, wavesense (imprecise) 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Undercommon](/Languages.aspx?ID=11)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +6, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +4\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +3\r\n\r\n**Dex** -1\r\n\r\n**Con** +3\r\n\r\n**Int** -3\r\n\r\n**Wis** +1\r\n\r\n**Cha** +0\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Corpse Disguise** ([exploration](/Traits.aspx?ID=66)) The graveshell conceals its true nature over the course of a few minutes by impaling a corpse (typically humanoid) on its spiky shell before partially submerging itself in water.
