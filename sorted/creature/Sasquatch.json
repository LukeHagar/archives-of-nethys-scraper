They avoid confrontations with humanoids unless drawn out by curiosity. In such cases, glimpses through the underbrush are typically the best an onlooker can hope for, as sasquatches are perfectly content to live their lives in peace hidden in the deep thickets of the wild.\n\n Despite their considerable bulk, sasquatches are capable of moving through forests with surprising grace and efficiency. Often, their distinctively pungent odor or the discovery of a few sets of unusually oversized footprints are the only signs of their presence. These footprints have helped to engender a popular nickname, “bigfoot,” for these mysterious creatures.\n\n While normally nonconfrontational, a sasquatch can be driven to violence when startled or when their homeland is threatened, be it by the expansion of pioneers or the intrusion of fell supernatural influences. Usually, a sasquatch's attack lasts as long as it takes to frighten away a foe; they rarely pursue those who flee from their displays of dominance.\n\n Sasquatches speak their own language, which mixes sounds easily mistaken for ambient wildlife calls and knocking—most often by striking a solid surface (such as a tree) with a branch or a stone—allowing a whole family of sasquatches to carry on conversations without alerting nearby humanoids. Even in death they avoid leaving traces behind, for when a sasquatch dies, their kin take pains to bury the body deep and hide the grave site well to protect the remains from scavengers and evil spirits alike.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 18\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 16\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 13\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Sasquatch.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 2\">[Sasquatch](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1287)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 3](/Sources.aspx?ID=66) pg. 225</row>\n\n**Perception** +8; [low-light vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=23), [scent](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=33) (imprecise) 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Sasquatch](/Languages.aspx?ID=70)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +9, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +5, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +9, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +6\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +5\r\n\r\n**Dex** +1\r\n\r\n**Con** +3\r\n\r\n**Int** -1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +2\r\n\r\n**Cha** +1\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 17 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +11 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +7 \r\n\r\n**Will** +6 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 36\n\n**[Catch Rock](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=7)** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> <br />**Emerge From Undergrowth** <actions string=\"Free Action\" /> **Trigger** The sasquatch is in forest terrain and rolls [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) for Initiative; **Effect** The sasquatch Strides up to half their Speed, after which they attempt to [Demoralize](/Actions.aspx?ID=53) a single creature within 15 feet.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nfist +11,\r\n**Damage** 1d10+5 bludgeoning\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nrock +9 ([Brutal](/Traits.aspx?ID=249), [range increment 30 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=248)),\r\n**Damage** 1d6+5 bludgeoning\n\n**Brutal Blows**   On a critical hit with a fist Strike, the target is knocked [prone](/Conditions.aspx?ID=31) by the blow.\r\n\r\n**Forest Stride**   The sasquatch ignores difficult terrain in forests.\r\n\r\n**Pungent**   The sasquatch's odor is quite powerful and can be detected at twice the normal distance by [scent](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=33).\r\n\r\n**Threatening Visage**   The sasquatch doesn't take a penalty to [Demoralize](/Actions.aspx?ID=53) a creature that doesn't understand their language.\r\n\r\n**[Throw Rock](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=38)** <actions string=\"Single Action\" />  \r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_4_RelatedCreatures.png\">Similarly Hidden</title>\r\n\r\nCreatures similar to the forest-dwelling sasquatches can be found throughout the world.
