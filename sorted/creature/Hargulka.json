The notion of becoming a “king” never crossed his mind until he had a vivid, unforgettable dream of himself sitting atop a throne and basking in the fear and adoration of not only trolls, but [hobgoblins](/Ancestries.aspx?ID=13), [harpies](/Monsters.aspx?ID=258), and all manner of slavering monsters—creatures who might be viewed as dangerous enemies but, to Hargulka, were now his loyal minions.\n\n To Hargulka, the PCs' kingdom is rightfully his own. He intends to conquer them, claim their capital for himself, and dine on the flesh and bones of their citizens. Yet despite these violent goals, the troll knows better than to simply attack his enemies mindlessly. Instead, he spends his time working with his loyal trolls to seek out like-minded monsters in the wilds to recruit them to his cause. As a result, the longer Hargulka remains in power, the more dangerous and aggressive the monsters of the Stolen Lands will become!\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 32\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 29\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Hargulka.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 8\">[Hargulka](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2194)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Unique\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=161\" />\r\n<trait label=\"CE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Giant\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=79\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Troll\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=241\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Kingmaker Adventure Path](/Sources.aspx?ID=150) pg. 598</row>\n\n**Perception** +16; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Jotun](/Languages.aspx?ID=8)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +18, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +18, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +16\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +6\r\n\r\n**Dex** +2\r\n\r\n**Con** +6\r\n\r\n**Int** +0\r\n\r\n**Wis** +2\r\n\r\n**Cha** +4\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n[Hide Armor](/Armor.aspx?ID=7), _+1 [darkwood](/Equipment.aspx?ID=376) [thundering](/Equipment.aspx?ID=306) [morningstar](/Weapons.aspx?ID=8)_\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 26 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +20 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +14 \r\n\r\n**Will** +16 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 190\r\n\r\n, regeneration 25 (deactivated by [acid](/Traits.aspx?ID=3) or [fire](/Traits.aspx?ID=72))\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\nfire 15\r\n\r\n**Dream of Rulership** ([abjuration](/Traits.aspx?ID=2), [primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=134)) The lingering effects of Nyrissa's inspiration are stronger than any fear Hargulka faces.
