Extremely diminutive and stealthy, they can slip into buildings or lurk under eaves with ease, making it easier to spy on others and learn their secrets. Chakanajes enjoy ferreting out secrets and tormenting their victims by leaving incriminating hints of the truth in places others might find them, or even messages threatening the victim that someone “knows the truth.” Fear of exposure can drive victims to commit atrocities, which a chakanaj uses to further exacerbate the victim's shame and fear, to the sahkil's ever-increasing enjoyment. A chakanaj can disguise themself as an item of roughly the same size, like a piece of clothing, and they especially enjoy forcing their victims to carry or wear them while they whisper hateful suggestions and stoke the victim's anxiety and suffering. While most sahkils don't have much to do with Norgorber, despite their shared alignment, chakanjes' love of secrets has led to more than one alliance over the years between the tiny sahkils and the minions of Norgorber, particularly in Norgorber's aspect of the Reaper of Reputation.
