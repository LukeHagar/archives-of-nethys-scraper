With a tendency toward reclusiveness, samsarans have delicate builds, enigmatic and pupilless eyes, and blood as clear as water. When a samsaran dies, their body vanishes and their soul instantly reincarnates into a newborn child elsewhere on the same plane: usually another samsaran, but occasionally a humanoid of a different ancestry.\n\n Though all samsarans have an innate understanding of their nature, they consciously remember little from their former lives. Some, however, are occasionally struck by disjointed memories or flashes of déjà vu linked to a previous existence that can earn them a reputation for preternatural wisdom and insight. Most samsarans prefer to lead studious lives filled with moments of deep reflection. Their sights remain set on the eternal and on enlightenment, reducing the appeal of the short-term material gains one can achieve in just one lifetime. A samsaran ceases their cycle of reincarnation only upon reaching perfect state of enlightenment—or falling so far from harmony that they proceed to a doomed afterlife.\n\n The ancestral home of the samsarans lies in Zi Ha, a remote mountain nation in Tian Xia. These treacherous mountains help ensure the solitude most samsarans prefer, and they're further protected by misguiding illusions, defensive wards, and secure fortifications.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 15\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 13\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 10\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Samsaran.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 1\">[Samsaran Anchorite](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1286)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Samsaran\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=362\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 3](/Sources.aspx?ID=66) pg. 224</row>\n\n**Perception** +9; [low-light vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=23)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Celestial](/Languages.aspx?ID=16), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Samsaran](/Languages.aspx?ID=69)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Medicine](/Skills.aspx?ID=9) +6, [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11) +6, [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13) +7, [Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14) +4\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +0\r\n\r\n**Dex** +2\r\n\r\n**Con** +0\r\n\r\n**Int** +1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +4\r\n\r\n**Cha** +2\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Cryptomnesia** A samsaran anchorite subconsciously retains bits of knowledge from their innumerable former lives, granting them a +1 circumstance bonus to skill checks that aren't listed in their skills above, and allowing them to attempt all skill actions that normally require the user to be trained.\r\n\r\n**Items**\r\n[Spear](/Weapons.aspx?ID=10), [Sling](/Weapons.aspx?ID=72) (10 bullets)\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 15 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +3 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +7 \r\n\r\n**Will** +9 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 16\n\n**All This Has Happened Before** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> ([divination](/Traits.aspx?ID=47), [occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120)) **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** The samsaran anchorite is about to roll initiative; **Effect** The anchorite experiences a flash of recognition from a previous existence, gaining a +4 circumstance bonus to the triggering roll.
