They delight in sabotaging the works of other creatures, often turning these works into dangerous traps. An individual vexgit might jam a door lock, loosen the wheels on a carriage, or remove nails from a boat hull. Buildings infested by vexgits become filled with traps like portcullises descending suddenly, water pipes exploding violently, and clock towers disgorging an avalanches of gears.<br /> Aware of their own physical weakness, vexgits carry hammers and other tools to leverage pieces apart or smash whatever they're unable to disassemble. Indeed, a hammer sized for a human becomes a maul in the tiny hands of a vexgit.<br /> Vexgit infestations range from one to a score. Larger groups are often led by a more powerful vexgit with additional skill in thievery or primal magic. Trained giant rats, vipers, and rat swarms are common in vexgit lairs.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Fey](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 15\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 13\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 10\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Gremlin_Vexgit.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 1\">[Vexgit](/Monsters.aspx?ID=688)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"LE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Tiny\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fey\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=69\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Gremlin\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=221\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 134 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +6; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Undercommon](/Languages.aspx?ID=11)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +7, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +6, [Crafting](/Skills.aspx?ID=4) +6, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +6, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +5, [Thievery](/Skills.aspx?ID=17) +7\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +1\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +2\r\n\r\n**Int** +1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +1\r\n\r\n**Cha** +0\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Clacking Exoskeleton** A creature that can hear gains a +2 circumstance bonus to its Perception DC against a vexgit's attempts to [Sneak](/Actions.aspx?ID=63).\r\n\r\n**Items**\r\n[Maul](/Weapons.aspx?ID=33)\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 16 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +5 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +9 \r\n\r\n**Will** +6 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 24\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\ncold iron 2\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 20 feet, climb 20 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nmaul +8 ([Shove](/Traits.aspx?ID=193)),\r\n**Damage** 1d12+1 bludgeoning plus Destructive Smash\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nbite +11 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179)),\r\n**Damage** 1d6+1 piercing\r\n\r\n**Primal Innate Spells** DC 17\r\n- **Cantrips (1st)**\r\n[Prestidigitation](/Spells.aspx?ID=229)\r\n- **1st**\r\n[Alarm](/Spells.aspx?ID=7)\r\n\r\n**Destructive Smash**   A vexgit's maul Strike against an object deals ignores up to 5 of the object's Hardness.\r\n\r\n**Gremlin Snare** <actions string=\"Three Actions\" /> ([Conjuration](/Traits.aspx?ID=33), [Primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=134)) **Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** The vexgit creates a [snare](/equipment/snares) of their level or lower that normally takes 1 minute to craft at no cost.
