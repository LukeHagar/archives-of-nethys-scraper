They were born under the cerulean skies of the Outer Plane of [Elysium](/Planes.aspx?ID=16) but have since spread to the [Material Plane](/Planes.aspx?ID=1), and it is here that they primarily reside. On Golarion,the largest garuda populations live in the rugged hills and mountains of Vudra, though some have spread to the Impossible Kingdom of Jalmeray and even to the eastern mountains of Garund.\n\n Garudas usually roost in isolated aeries but spend much of their time gliding on the wind. Many garudas are nomadic or migratory, yearning to travel and soar above new landscapes. While they remain detached from humanoid societies, they are impetuous and gallant, frequently serving as protectors of communities near the cliffs and peaks where they roost. Some garudas instead combine their wanderlust and goodhearted nature by serving as messengers and emissaries between remote settlements, though most who take up this work abandon it after a few years when the same terrain becomes boring. Wandering garudas are no less compassionate, and many a tale tells of a garuda who came to the aid of a lost traveler or carried an endangered soul to safety.\n\n Though they hold most living creatures in high regard, garudas loathe ophidian creatures—[nagas](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=75) in particular. Rarely do they come into contact without fighting, and a garuda will go out of their way to hunt down a naga if they hear even the tiniest hint of a rumor suggesting the presence of one.\n\n A garuda's feathering and coloration range widely depending on the terrain they favor. Garudas in temperate woodlands might resemble jays or falcons, while tropical garudas sport bright plumage.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Celestial](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 26\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 24\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 21\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Garuda.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 9\">[Garuda](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1162)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"CG\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Celestial\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=23\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 3](/Sources.aspx?ID=66) pg. 104</row>\n\n**Perception** +20; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Celestial](/Languages.aspx?ID=16), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Vudrani](/Languages.aspx?ID=45)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +21, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +17, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +19, [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13) +16, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +19, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +16\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +4\r\n\r\n**Dex** +6\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** +2\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** +4\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n_+1 [striking](/Equipment.aspx?ID=280) [composite longbow](/Weapons.aspx?ID=74)_ (100 arrows)\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 28 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +17 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +21 \r\n\r\n**Will** +16 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 135\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 25 feet, fly 60 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nbeak +21 ([Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179)),\r\n**Damage** 2d10+7 piercing plus 1d6 good\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\ntalon +21 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179)),\r\n**Damage** 2d8+7 slashing plus 1d6 good\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\n_shock composite longbow_ +22 ([deadly d10](/Traits.aspx?ID=174), [Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [range increment 100 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=248), [reload 0](/Traits.aspx?ID=254), [volley 30 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=201)),\r\n**Damage** 2d8+5 piercing plus 1d6 electricity and 1d6 good\r\n\r\n**Divine Innate Spells** DC 27\r\n- **1st**\r\n[True Strike](/Spells.aspx?ID=345) (at will)\r\n- **2nd**\r\n[See Invisibility](/Spells.aspx?ID=271) (×3)\r\n- **3rd**\r\n[Haste](/Spells.aspx?ID=147)\r\n- **4th**\r\n[Freedom of Movement](/Spells.aspx?ID=128)\r\n\r\n**Electric Projectiles**  ([Arcane](/Traits.aspx?ID=11), [Evocation](/Traits.aspx?ID=65)) Any arrow the garuda fires gains the effects of a [_shock_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=303) rune.\r\n\r\n**Swooping Dive** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" />  The garuda flies up to their Speed in a straight line, descending at least 10 feet, and then makes two talon Strikes.\r\n\r\n**Wind Blast** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([Air](/Traits.aspx?ID=5), [Evocation](/Traits.aspx?ID=65)) The garuda flaps their wings with intense force.
