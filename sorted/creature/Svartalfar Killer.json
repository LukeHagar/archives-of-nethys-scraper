These beings made a new home on the [Shadow Plane](/Equipment.aspx?ID=288), which warped their minds and essence and turned them into cold, ruthless killers. Their clans are places of safety but not kindness for svartalfars; they feel no amity toward others, and their actions almost exclusively focus on practicalities.\n\n Svartalfars resemble expressionless elves with pale eyes and gray skin. Many have smooth, bald heads, while others keep their hair short and practical. Svartalfars seem untouched by emotions, especially compassion or mercy. When given a contract, a svartalfar clan seeks its target with grim diligence. Money means next to nothing to them, and attempts to appeal for pity go unheard. A svartalfar clan knows that if they don't end the target's life, another clan will do so, which is a blow to the reputation and standing of the clan that failed.\n\n Svartalfar communities on the Shadow Plane are usually very small, featuring slender towers and extensive underground chambers. Built on or near thin spots between the Shadow Plane and the [Material Plane](/Planes.aspx?ID=1), these communities allow svartalfars easy access to Golarion, where many of their targets reside. \r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Fey](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 26\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 24\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 21\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Svartalfar_SvartalfarKiller.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 8\">[Svartalfar Killer](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1003)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"LE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fey\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=69\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #159: All or Nothing](/Sources.aspx?ID=48) pg. 85</row>\n\n**Perception** +16; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Aklo](/Languages.aspx?ID=13), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Elven](/Languages.aspx?ID=4), [Sylvan](/Languages.aspx?ID=10)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +18, [Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2) +16, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +18, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +18, [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11) +16, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +18, [Thievery](/Skills.aspx?ID=17) +14\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +1\r\n\r\n**Dex** +6\r\n\r\n**Con** +2\r\n\r\n**Int** +4\r\n\r\n**Wis** +2\r\n\r\n**Cha** +3\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n[crossbow with 20 bolts](/Weapons.aspx?ID=67), _+1 [striking](/Equipment.aspx?ID=280) [elven curve blade](/Weapons.aspx?ID=50)_, [Graveroot](/Equipment.aspx?ID=116) (2), [Leather Armor](/Armor.aspx?ID=4)\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 27 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +11 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +19 \r\n\r\n**Will** +16 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 135\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\ncold iron 10\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 25 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\n_elven curve blade_ +21 ([Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179), [Forceful](/Traits.aspx?ID=180)),\r\n**Damage** 2d8+5 slashing\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\ncrossbow +20 ([range increment 120 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=248), [reload 1](/Traits.aspx?ID=254)),\r\n**Damage** 1d8+4 piercing\r\n\r\n**Arcane Innate Spells** DC 26, attack +18\r\n- **Cantrips (4th)**\r\n[Acid Splash](/Spells.aspx?ID=3), [Chill Touch](/Spells.aspx?ID=35), [Electric Arc](/Spells.aspx?ID=97), [Produce Flame](/Spells.aspx?ID=236)\r\n- **1st**\r\n[Ray of Enfeeblement](/Spells.aspx?ID=244), [True Strike](/Spells.aspx?ID=345)\r\n- **2nd**\r\n[Invisibility](/Spells.aspx?ID=164) (×2)\r\n- **3rd**\r\n[Shocking Grasp](/Spells.aspx?ID=283)\r\n\r\n**Shadow Step** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" />  The svartalfar killer fades into shadow, Strides up to twice its Speed, and reforms.
