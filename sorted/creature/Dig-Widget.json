Each dig-widget contains numerous simple tools, including a set of mechanical devices that function as [thieves' tools](/Equipment.aspx?ID=58), two arms with drills, and two arms with corkscrews for attaching to and climbing surfaces. Once activated, these devices propel themselves forward. Though they have the full faculties typical of a construct, they usually follow a simple routine: avoid notice, pick any lock barring the path, dig past obstacles, and attack if caught.
