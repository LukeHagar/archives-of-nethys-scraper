On the Abyss, balors serve demon lords as generals or captains, and they typically command vast legions of demons. Standing at 14 feet in height, only the cruelest mortal souls—those who devoted entire lives to sins too numerous to count—can fuel the formation of a balor. More often, a balor forms from a mass of dozens of mortal souls who shared debased ideologies in life. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Balor Lords</title> Those rare few balors who form from single souls are the ones most likely to eventually transcend the notable power they already wield, becoming a nascent demon lord. These balor lords are each unique creatures of 21st to 25th level in power who rule their own realm in the Abyss. In time, a balor lord can further develop into a unique creature with wildly different powers, even ascending to the role of a true demon lord.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Fiend](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 40\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 38\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 35\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Demon_Balor.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 20\">[Balor](/Monsters.aspx?ID=104)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"CE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Demon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=42\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fiend\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=70\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 83</row>\n\n**Perception** +36; darkvision, [_true seeing_](/Spells.aspx?ID=344)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Abyssal](/Languages.aspx?ID=12), [Celestial](/Languages.aspx?ID=16), [Draconic](/Languages.aspx?ID=2); telepathy 100 feet\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +35, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +37, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +36, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +32, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +38, [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13) +32, [Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14) +32, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +33\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +9\r\n\r\n**Dex** +7\r\n\r\n**Con** +9\r\n\r\n**Int** +6\r\n\r\n**Wis** +6\r\n\r\n**Cha** +8\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n[Longsword](/Weapons.aspx?ID=31)\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 45 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +39 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +35 \r\n\r\n**Will** +34 \r\n\r\n+1 status to all saves vs. magic\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 480\n\n**Immunities**\r\n[fire](/Traits.aspx?ID=72)\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\ncold 20, cold iron 20, good 20\r\n\r\n**Aura of Flame** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [evocation](/Traits.aspx?ID=65), [fire](/Traits.aspx?ID=72)) 20 feet.
