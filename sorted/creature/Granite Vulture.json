Undamaged, the vulture-shaped vessel is an object with 28 Hit Points (BT 14). While the vulture is in spirit form, damaging them doesn't hurt the vessel, but damaging the vessel deals an equal amount of damage to the vulture. While the vulture Inhabits their vessel, they're a single target, and damage reduces the Hit Points of both the vulture and the vessel. If the vessel is [broken](/Conditions.aspx?ID=2), the vulture can still fight normally while inhabiting the vessel and suffers no ill effect; if the vessel is destroyed, the vulture is instantly incorporated into its secondary vessel.<br />**Reconstitution** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) When the vulture reaches 0 Hit Points, their spirit dissipates. If their vessel remains intact, the vulture re-forms within it after 2d4 days, fully healed. If the vessel is broken, their receptacle reconstitutes the vessel in 2d4 days, and the vulture re-forms within it in another 2d4 days. In the meantime, the vulture's consciousness inhabits their spirit receptacle. If both their vessel and receptacle are destroyed, the vulture is instantly slain and can't reconstitute.<br />**Spirit Receptacle** If the granite vulture's bonded vessel is destroyed, their spirit inhabits an inanimate skull-shaped receptacle. In this state, they're [petrified](/Conditions.aspx?ID=30) and can take no actions other than to speak telepathically until they are Reconstituted. The spirit receptacle has 56 Hit Points (BT 14, Hardness 7).\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 20 feet, fly 25 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njaws ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179)),\r\n**Damage** 1d6+4 piercing plus 1 [persistent bleed damage](/Conditions.aspx?ID=29)\r\n\r\n**Divine Innate Spells** DC 17\r\n- **1st**\r\n[Detect Alignment](/Spells.aspx?ID=65) (at will; chaos or good only)\r\n\r\n**Inhabit Vessel** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([Manipulate](/Traits.aspx?ID=104)) The vulture touches and melds with their bonded vessel, bringing the statue to life.
