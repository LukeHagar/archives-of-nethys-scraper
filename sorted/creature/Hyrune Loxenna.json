Hyrune's giant bat shape's fangs have a +28 attack bonus and deal 3d12+16 piercing damage\n<ul><li>**Bat** The vampire changes into a bat swarm or giant bat.

If the new vampire is lower level than its creator, it is under the creator's control. If a vampire controls too many spawn at once (as determined by the GM), strong-willed spawn can free themselves by succeeding at a Will saving throw against the vampire's Will DC.\r\n\r\n**Dominate** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([Divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [Enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61), [Incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=93), [Mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [Visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=163)) The vampire can cast [_dominate_](/Spells.aspx?ID=87) at will as a divine innate spell (DC 36). Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the [visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=163) trait. A creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that vampire's Dominate for 24 hours. Fully destroying the vampire ends the domination, but merely reducing the vampire to 0 HP is insufficient to break the spell.\r\n\r\n**Drink Blood** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([Divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [Necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) **Requirement** A [grabbed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=20), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [restrained](/Conditions.aspx?ID=33), [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38), or willing creature is within the vampire's reach. **Effect** The vampire sinks its fangs into that creature to drink its blood. This requires an [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is [drained 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=10) and Hyrune regains 22 HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire but increases the victim's drain value by 1. A vampire can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but it gains no HP from doing so.<br />A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a DC 20 [Medicine](/Skills.aspx?ID=9) check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drain by 1 after 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n**Familiar**   Hyrune's familiar is Taulzhalotel, a one-eyed, long-tailed hairless bat with a fly speed of 25 feet, [darkvision](/Familiars.aspx?ID=5), [manual dexterity](/Familiars.aspx?ID=10) (with its tail), [speech](/Familiars.aspx?ID=12), and [spell delivery](/Familiars.aspx?ID=18).\r\n\r\n**Gluttonous Gulp** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([Divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [Necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) Hyrune dislocates his jaw to open his mouth far wider than it should, growing a thicket of additional fangs as he does. He attempts a fangs Strike and deals an additional 3d6 piercing damage on a successful hit and can attempt to Drink Blood if he as an action remaining, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus on his [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) check to do so.\r\n\r\n**Turn to Mist** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([Concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32), [Divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [Transmutation](/Traits.aspx?ID=157)) The vampire turns into a cloud of vapor, as the [_gaseous form_](/Spells.aspx?ID=129) spell, or back to its normal form. The vampire loses fast healing while in gaseous form. The vampire can remain in this form indefinitely.\r\n\r\n</column>",

Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire but increases the victim's drain value by 1. A vampire can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but it gains no HP from doing so. A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drain by 1 after 10 minutes. Familiar Hyrune's familiar is Taulzhalotel, a one-eyed, long-tailed hairless bat with a fly speed of 25 feet, darkvision, manual dexterity (with its tail), speech, and spell delivery. Gluttonous Gulp Two Actions (Divine, Necromancy) Hyrune dislocates his jaw to open his mouth far wider than it should, growing a thicket of additional fangs as he does. He attempts a fangs Strike and deals an additional 3d6 piercing damage on a successful hit and can attempt to Drink Blood if he as an action remaining, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus on his Athletics check to do so. Turn to Mist Single Action (Concentrate, Divine, Transmutation) The vampire turns into a cloud of vapor, as the gaseous form spell, or back to its normal form. The vampire loses fast healing while in gaseous form. The vampire can remain in this form indefinitely. ",
