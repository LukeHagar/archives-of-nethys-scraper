Every crossroads guardian exists to satisfy a particular need—usually a quest that must be carried out, helpless individuals who must be saved from harm, or an object or location which must be guarded. Although they often appear at actual crossroads, a crossroads guardian can materialize anywhere there is a community, from a giant metropolis to a [lizardfolk](/Ancestries.aspx?ID=15) village in a remote swamp.\n\n Some crossroads guardians are martial beings—defending a mystic fountain against all intruders, for example—but most are helpers and assistants, guiding heroes through the wilderness to where they're needed. A guardian is a skilled warrior and can defend a location, but when its purpose involves a quest, or the need is so great that the guardian isn't up to the task alone, the guardian must persuade others to voluntarily accept their quest.\n\n Once a crossroads guardian has fulfilled its purpose, it either shifts to satisfy a new need or quest—often changing its alignment and abilities as well—or else slowly vanishes, returning to the raw primal magic from which it was formed.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Fey](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 28\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 26\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 23\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/CrossroadsGuardian.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 7\">[Crossroads Guardian](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1108)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Rare\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=137\" />\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fey\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=69\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 3](/Sources.aspx?ID=66) pg. 59</row>\n\n**Perception** +19; recognize hero\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Sylvan](/Languages.aspx?ID=10); [_tongues_](/Spells.aspx?ID=340)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2) +16, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +20, [Medicine](/Skills.aspx?ID=9) +17, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +19, [Performance](/Skills.aspx?ID=12) +16, [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11) +16, [Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +20, [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13) +17, [Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14) +16, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +19\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +5\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +3\r\n\r\n**Int** +5\r\n\r\n**Wis** +6\r\n\r\n**Cha** +7\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Bound** A crossroads guardian is bound to the site of its creation, but it can leave so long as it remains within 100 feet of the object it is guarding or individuals under a [geas](/Rituals.aspx?ID=12) to fulfill the guardian's need.
