Medusas are shrewd and manipulative adversaries who collect and covet secrets, and who use threats and guile to exploit the fears of weaker creatures. A medusa may seek out powerful magic items, use divination magic to discover secret knowledge and unlock forbidden power, or infiltrate a society to beguile influential politicians. Their ability to worm their way into powerful organizations makes them natural leaders of criminal outfits and thieves’ guilds, and their interest in magical phenomena leads some to pursue careers as oracles who offer to help adventurers find what they seek—for a price. Of course, if wit and deception proves insufficient, a medusa can always simply turn rivals into ornate stone decorations with little more than a glare.\n\n Exceptionally agile and surprisingly hardy, a medusa rarely backs down from a conflict even when cornered. Many adventurers who thought themselves readied to resist the effects of a medusa’s gaze have nevertheless fallen to a medusa, as these creatures are also often deadly archers able to riddle their foes with venom-coated arrows from a distance. Still, a medusa may barter for their life if no alternatives remain, and the secrets carried by these powerful villains often make it more than worth sparing the monster’s life.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 23\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 21\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 18\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Medusa.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 7\">[Medusa](/Monsters.aspx?ID=297)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"LE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 234</row>\n\n**Perception** +16; darkvision\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +16, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +14, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +16\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +2\r\n\r\n**Dex** +5\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** +2\r\n\r\n**Wis** +1\r\n\r\n**Cha** +2\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n[Shortsword](/Weapons.aspx?ID=43), [_+1 composite shortbow_](/Weapons.aspx?ID=75) (60 arrows)\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 25 all-around vision\r\n\r\n**Fort** +15 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +16 \r\n\r\n**Will** +14 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 105\n\n**Petrifying Gaze** ([arcane](/Traits.aspx?ID=11), [aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [transmutation](/Traits.aspx?ID=157), [visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=163)) 30 feet.
