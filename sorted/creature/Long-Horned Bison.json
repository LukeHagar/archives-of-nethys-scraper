Despite their relation to more placid bovines, however, long-horned bison are ill-tempered and territorial. Their tread shakes the ground, while the thunder of their stampedes can be mistaken for an earthquake. Long-horned bison weigh upwards of 4,500 pounds and measure up to 9 feet tall and 16 feet long. Their horns, measured tip to tip, can be almost as wide as the bison are tall.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Animal](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 22\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 20\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 17\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Bison_LongHorned.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 6\">[Long-Horned Bison](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1773)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Huge\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Animal\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=9\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #176: Lost Mammoth Valley](/Sources.aspx?ID=113) pg. 83</row>\n\n**Perception** +13; [scent](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=33) (imprecise) 60 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\n\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +16, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +13\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +6\r\n\r\n**Dex** +2\r\n\r\n**Con** +5\r\n\r\n**Int** -5\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** +0\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 23 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +17 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +12 \r\n\r\n**Will** +12 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 110\n\n**Cold Adaptation** The bison reduces the effects it suffers from [cold environments](/Rules.aspx?ID=642) by one step.<br />**Toss** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> **Trigger** A creature ends its movement within reach of the bison's horn Strike; **Effect** The bison attempts to [Shove](/Actions.aspx?ID=38) the triggering creature with its horns.
