Their beauty is a source of great pride but is also something of a weakness, as crystal dragons are easily angered by insults about their appearance. Despite their relatively benign natures when compared to other true dragons, crystal dragons can be short tempered and prone to finding insults where none were intended. Although their opinions are changeable, crystal dragons prefer orderly environments and are not fond of sudden interruptions or distractions.\n\nCrystal dragons build their lairs in underground grottoes, where they cultivate environments of great beauty. Their exacting standards and vivid imaginations mean that they are always working to improve the appearance or layout of some part of their lair. These lairs are unique to each individual crystal dragon, but there are always plenty of reflective surfaces that allow the dragon to observe their own appearance. These range from crystals to reflecting pools to finely crafted mirrors, which are arranged throughout the lair in a pleasing array. Gifts of well-crafted or magical mirrors are an excellent way to curry favor with a crystal dragon.\n\nAlthough crystal dragons are easily distracted by their sparkling collections or their vanity, they remain good-hearted creatures at the core and make friends quickly. While a crystal dragon tends to find evil creatures uncouth and unpleasant, any other nearby denizen or inhabitant of their home could become fast friends or beloved pets, depending upon the creature's capacity for conversation (and for providing the frequent praise and compliments that crystal dragons hunger for).\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Dragon](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2)): DC 25\r\n\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Elemental](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2), [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 25\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 23\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 20\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/DragonCrystal.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 7\">[Young Crystal Dragon](/Monsters.aspx?ID=627)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"NG\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Dragon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=50\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Earth\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=55\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Elemental\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=57\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 91 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +15; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), [scent (imprecise) 60 feet](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=33), [tremorsense (imprecise) 30 feet](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=40)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Draconic](/Languages.aspx?ID=2), [Terran](/Languages.aspx?ID=22)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +14, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +16, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +15, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +15, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +15, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +18, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +15\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +5\r\n\r\n**Dex** +1\r\n\r\n**Con** +3\r\n\r\n**Int** +1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +2\r\n\r\n**Cha** +4\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 27 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +16 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +14 \r\n\r\n**Will** +15 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 105\n\n**Immunities**\r\n[paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [sleep](/Traits.aspx?ID=145)\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\nsonic 5\r\n\r\n**[Frightful Presence](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=17)** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=68), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) 90 feet, DC 25<br />**Twisting Tail** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> **Trigger** A creature within reach of the dragon's tail uses a [move](/Traits.aspx?ID=114) action or leaves a square during a move action it's using; **Effect** The dragon makes a tail Strike at the creature with a –2 penalty.
