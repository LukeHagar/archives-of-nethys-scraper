If the creature was already drained 1 by the death-stealing gaze before attempting the save, a failed save increases the value of the drained condition by 1, to a maximum of drained 4.

The demon makes a black flame knife Strike. On a successful attack, the vrolikai deals the damage from a black flame knife Strike to the target, plus an additional 2d6 negative damage for every black flame knife they wield beyond the first (typically 6d6 extra damage). Even on a failed attack, the vrolikai deals the damage from one black flame knife to the target, though they still miss completely on a critical failure. On a critical hit, the victim becomes [drained 2](/Conditions.aspx?ID=10) as the focused attack drains pure life essence as well as damage.

Further failed saves against mindwarping increase the condition value by 1, to a maximum of stupefied 4. <br />**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature also becomes confused for 1 minute.\r\n\r\n**Stolen Death**   A creature that dies while suffering drain from a vrolikai's death-stealing gaze rises as a [ghoul](/Monsters.aspx?ID=218) the next midnight.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Vrolikai Newcomers</title>\r\n\r\nWhen vrolikais first manifest on the [Abyss](/Planes.aspx?ID=13), they have no base of power and are, despite their abilities, relatively defenseless from denizens even more powerful than themselves.

Success The creature becomes stupefied 1 for 1 minute. Failure The creature becomes stupefied 1. Further failed saves against mindwarping increase the condition value by 1, to a maximum of stupefied 4. Critical Failure As failure, but the creature also becomes confused for 1 minute.
