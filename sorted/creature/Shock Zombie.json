Most have two large electric coils mounted on their backs to absorb and project electricity. If uncontrolled, shock zombies often wander far afield in search of inventors' labs or lightning storms to draw power from. In a pinch, the natural electric currents inside living creatures more than suffice. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Zombie Abilities</title> You can modify shock zombies with the following zombie abilities, in addition to those available to all zombies. Most shock zombies have one of these abilities; if you give a shock zombie more, you might want to increase its level and adjust its statistics. \n\n**Arcing Strikes** ([electricity](/Traits.aspx?ID=56)) When a shock zombie hits a creature with a melee attack, an arc of lighting leaps to a second creature, dealing 1d12 electricity damage. This secondary target must be within 10 feet of the shock zombie's original target and must be the creature closest to the original target (if multiple creatures are equidistant, the shock zombie chooses which to affect). \n\n**Breath Weapon** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([electricity](/Traits.aspx?ID=56), [evocation](/Traits.aspx?ID=65)) The shock zombie breathes lightning, dealing 4d12 electricity damage in a 40-foot line (DC 24 [basic](/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Reflex save). It can't use its Breath Weapon again for 1 minute. \n\n**Electromechanical Phasing** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([electricity](/Traits.aspx?ID=56)) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The shock zombie activates its electromechanical components and begins phasing in and out of reality.
