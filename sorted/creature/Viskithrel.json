They are social creatures by nature and prefer to hunt in large packs, chasing down prey and tearing them apart to share with their fellow hunters. A lone viskithrel forgoes hunting to frantically seek out others of its kind, starving to death if it cannot do so. Although viskithrels attack nearly any other creatures they encounter, they virtually never fight other viskithrels; even beasts in rival packs give each other space rather than fight over territory or prey.\n\n Other, smarter denizens of Gluttondark, such as [xilvireks](/Monsters.aspx?ID=534)  herd and train viskithrels, working to convince the viskithrels that the trainer is one of their pack. This not only protects the trainer from attacks by the viskithrels, but also enables the trainer to easily direct them.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Beast](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2), [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 36\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 34\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 31\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Viskithrel.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 15\">[Viskithrel](/Monsters.aspx?ID=981)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Huge\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Beast\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=20\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #156: The Apocalypse Prophet](/Sources.aspx?ID=36) pg. 84</row>\n\n**Perception** +27; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), [scent (precise) 100 feet](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=33)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Abyssal](/Languages.aspx?ID=12); (can't speak any languages)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +25, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +31, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +27\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +8\r\n\r\n**Dex** +6\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** -3\r\n\r\n**Wis** +4\r\n\r\n**Cha** -1\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Ravenous Tracker** A viskithrel can detect a creature's scent up to a week after the creature has passed through or left an area, and it gains a +4 circumstance bonus to [Track](/Actions.aspx?ID=66) a creature whose scent it has detected.\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 37 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +25 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +27 \r\n\r\n**Will** +23 \r\n\r\nselective scent\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 275\n\n**Immunities**\r\n[sickened](/Conditions.aspx?ID=34)\n\n**Selective Scent** A viskithrel's many-chambered snout allows it to partition and ignore scents.
