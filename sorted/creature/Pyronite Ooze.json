So-called pyronite oozes sometimes spontaneously manifest from stockpiles of pyronite or other powerful explosives, typically amid mana storms or when affected by powerful magic.\n\n Pyronite oozes have an extremely unstable life cycle and are defined by their ability to continuously explode and reform themselves. A pyronite ooze's violent explosions hinder observations, making it difficult to learn anything from the volatile jelly. To complicate matters further, pyronite oozes seem drawn to other unstable alchemical concoctions. Test subjects brought to the Spellscar Desert have been observed bathing themselves in pools of magic-polluted effluvia. Although they typically reform into a single entity after exploding, pyronite oozes bathed in chemicals sometimes remain apart after splitting, creating two independent oozes.
