Their bodies are ruined and rebuilt, hollow and twisted, even as their minds undergo a spiritual transformation. They gain the ability to bind other souls to their own and drain their essence for magical power, yet can never be sated in their pursuit of it.

If a creature is slain by this attack, its soul becomes trapped within the devourer. While its soul is trapped, a creature can't be resurrected except by powerful magic such as a [_wish_](/Spells.aspx?ID=377) spell. Destroying the devourer or successfully counteracting Devour Soul (see Spell Deflection above) releases the soul. The devourer can hold only one soul at a time. A soul has 5 soul charges per level of the originating creature (see Soul Spells below). The devourer can expend these charges to cast spells. If the soul is freed and the creature returns to life, the creature is drained 1 for every 5 soul charges expended. If reduced to 0 soul charges, the soul is consumed and can be restored to life only by powerful magic such as _wish_.\r\n\r\n**Drain Life**  ([Divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [Necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) When the devourer damages a living creature with its claw Strike, the devourer gains 10 temporary Hit Points and the creature must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude save or become [drained 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=10). Further damage dealt by the devourer increases the condition value by 1 on a failed save, to a maximum of drained 4.\r\n\r\n**Soul Spells**   A devourer casts occult innate spells, but to do so it must expend a number of soul charges equal to the spell's level (similar to casting a spell using charges from a staff). It can heighten any spell to a maximum of 6th level by expending more charges as it Casts the Spell. When encountered, a devourer typically has one trapped soul with 10 soul charges.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Forms From Beyond</title>\r\n\r\nRegardless of their original ancestry, devourers are always Large—fully 10 feet tall—as the remains of their mortal form strain to contain the evil within.
