Annis hags are the most direct of all hags, engaging in physical combat and using their change shape ability to hunt rather than to infiltrate and betray humanoids. But an Annis hag takes a grisly trophy from each kill and uses it to sow discord, sending the trophy to one of her victim’s loved ones in a way that implicates another family member in the murder. Also known as iron hags, annis hags have iron-like yet flexible flesh that resists edged weapons, and their own touch is the same cold iron that burns the flesh of other hags. This allows them to bully their way to the leadership of hag covens.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 22\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 20\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 17\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Hag_AnnisHag.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 6\">[Annis Hag](/Monsters.aspx?ID=256)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"CE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Hag\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=84\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 202</row>\n\n**Perception** +15; darkvision\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Aklo](/Languages.aspx?ID=13), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Jotun](/Languages.aspx?ID=8)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +10, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +14, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +11, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +9, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +11, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +14\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +6\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** +1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +4\r\n\r\n**Cha** +3\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Coven** An annis hag adds [_earthbind_](/Spells.aspx?ID=94), [_passwall_](/Spells.aspx?ID=216), and [_spellwrack_](/Spells.aspx?ID=298) to her coven’s spells.\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 24 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +16 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +12 \r\n\r\n**Will** +14 \r\n\r\n+1 status to all saves vs. magic\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 85\n\n**Resistances**\r\nphysical 5 (except bludgeoning)\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 40 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nclaw +16 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 2d8+6 cold iron slashing plus [Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=18)\n\n**Bonds of Iron** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([Attack](/Traits.aspx?ID=15), [Conjuration](/Traits.aspx?ID=33), [Occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120)) Once per day, an annis hag can cause a cage built of cold iron fingernails to spring out of nothingness at a range of up to 30 feet, attempting an [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) check to Grapple against the target’s Fortitude DC; if the target has a weakness to cold iron, the annis hag gains a +2 circumstance bonus to this check.
