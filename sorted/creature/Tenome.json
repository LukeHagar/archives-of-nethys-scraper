When they opens their disturbingly wide mouth, this sly, frightful predator's fangs hum and pulse with an eerie drone.\n\n Tenomes prefer to stalk urban environments; they often wear hooded cloaks or flowing robes to obscure their monstrous features, posing as beggars or corpses to blend in with society. When they attack, tenomes approach their victim with their palms outstretched, attempting to trap prey with their terrifying gaze. Once they seize their prey, tenomes vibrate their strange teeth rapidly as they feasts, emulsifying the bones into a digestible ooze that they slurps from a wound. Tenomes can be put at a disadvantage while hunting, as their vision is obscured when they have prey grabbed. Because of this, tenomes either wait for lone victims or hunts in packs. Members of these groups work together to secure meals for the entire pack and protect each other from being ambushed while feeding.\n\n There are rumors that if tenomes pluck the eyes from their victim and places one in each of the corpse's palms, the slain creature will rise as a new tenome the next nightfall. Even tenomes aren't sure of the truth of this rumor, as none remember their own origins, but they might mutilate the corpses of their victims this way in the hopes of creating a pack mate or to instill terror in those who discover the body.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 19\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 17\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 14\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Tenome.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 4\">[Tenome](/Monsters.aspx?ID=995)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #158: Sixty Feet Under](/Sources.aspx?ID=47) pg. 85</row>\n\n**Perception** +14; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +12, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +11, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +10, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +10, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +12, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +8\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +4\r\n\r\n**Dex** +5\r\n\r\n**Con** +3\r\n\r\n**Int** +0\r\n\r\n**Wis** +0\r\n\r\n**Cha** +2\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 21 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +13 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +15 \r\n\r\n**Will** +12 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 60\n\n**Obscuring Grab** While the tenome is Grabbing a creature, all other creatures are [concealed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=4) to the tenome.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 25 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njaws +14,\r\n**Damage** 2d8+4 piercing\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nclaw +14 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170)),\r\n**Damage** 2d6+4 slashing plus [Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=18)\n\n**Bone Drink** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([Healing](/Traits.aspx?ID=89), [Necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117), [Occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120)) **Requirement** The tenome has a creature [grabbed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=20) or [restrained](/Conditions.aspx?ID=33); **Effect** The tenome makes a jaws Strike against the grabbed or restrained creature.
