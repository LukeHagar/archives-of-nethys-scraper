Privateers work for their own profit and reputation, of course, but they also commit themselves to keeping the sea-lanes free from navies that strive to enforce land law on the unbounded waves. Tyrants and slavers are their favorite targets, and many a greedy colonizer or trafficker in flesh has been sent to the bottom of the sea after the captain liberated their cargo.

Many call on the power of the fickle goddess Besmara to strengthen their crew in battle and sanctify each shipboard raid. As at home in water as on deck, a privateer captain will gladly leap into the sea to pursue a foe or rescue a fallen crewmate. Though the privateer captain might run under a false flag or attempt to deceive a foe before battle, they generally honor agreements to surrender and make a point to keep their word, particularly when dealing with other Firebrands.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 28\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 26\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 23\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 11\">[Privateer Captain](/NPCs.aspx?ID=966)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"CG\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Human\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=90\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Character Guide](/Sources.aspx?ID=12) pg. 119 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +21; [_see invisibility_](/Spells.aspx?ID=271)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Aquan](/Languages.aspx?ID=14), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +20, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +17, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +21, [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13) +23, [Sailing Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +19, [Thievery](/Skills.aspx?ID=17) +22\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +1\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +3\r\n\r\n**Int** +0\r\n\r\n**Wis** +5\r\n\r\n**Cha** +3\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n[_+1 chain shirt_](/Armor.aspx?ID=6), [_+1 crossbow_](/Weapons.aspx?ID=67) (100 bolts), [_moderate healing potion_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=186) (2), _+1 [striking](/Equipment.aspx?ID=280) [rapier](/Weapons.aspx?ID=36)_, _scroll of [_remove fear_](/Spells.aspx?ID=252)_\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 30 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +19 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +20 \r\n\r\n**Will** +23 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 175\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 25 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\n_rapier_ +21 ([deadly 1d8](/Traits.aspx?ID=174), [Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [Disarm](/Traits.aspx?ID=175)),\r\n**Damage** 2d6+5 piercing\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\n_crossbow_ +21 ([Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [range increment 120 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=248), [reload 1](/Traits.aspx?ID=254)),\r\n**Damage** 1d8+5 piercing\r\n\r\n**Divine Prepared Spells** DC 30\r\n- **Cantrips (6th)**\r\n[Chill Touch](/Spells.aspx?ID=35), [Detect Magic](/Spells.aspx?ID=66), [Know Direction](/Spells.aspx?ID=169), [Light](/Spells.aspx?ID=171), [Shield](/Spells.aspx?ID=280)\r\n- **1st**\r\n[Air Bubble](/Spells.aspx?ID=5), [Bane](/Spells.aspx?ID=18), [Gust of Wind](/Spells.aspx?ID=143)\r\n- **2nd**\r\n[Faerie Fire](/Spells.aspx?ID=107), [Resist Energy](/Spells.aspx?ID=256), [Water Walk](/Spells.aspx?ID=371)\r\n- **3rd**\r\n[Blindness](/Spells.aspx?ID=26), [Dispel Magic](/Spells.aspx?ID=78)\r\n- **4th**\r\n[Freedom of Movement](/Spells.aspx?ID=128), [Silence](/Spells.aspx?ID=287), [Water Breathing](/Spells.aspx?ID=370) (already cast)\r\n- **5th**\r\n[Breath of Life](/Spells.aspx?ID=29), [Control Water](/Spells.aspx?ID=51), [See Invisibility](/Spells.aspx?ID=271) (already cast)\r\n- **6th**\r\n[Blade Barrier](/Spells.aspx?ID=24), [Harm](/Spells.aspx?ID=146) (×4), [Repulsion](/Spells.aspx?ID=254)\r\n\r\n**Cleric Domain Spells** DC 30,  2 Focus Points\r\n- **6th**\r\n[Downpour](/Spells.aspx?ID=417), [Tidal Surge](/Spells.aspx?ID=458)\r\n\r\n**Reach Spell** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([Concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32), [Metamagic](/Traits.aspx?ID=107)) If the next action the privateer captain uses is to Cast a Spell that has a range, increase that spell's range by 30 feet.
