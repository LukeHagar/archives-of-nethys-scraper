This indignation can still manifest in violent ways, though, as a transformed werebear becomes temporarily blind to its alliances and has little control over its bestial temper. As a result, werebears are loners, rarely even living together as families longer than necessary. Werebears know that as long as they live solitary lives, they can serve as protectors and guardians in wilderness regions without the overwhelming fear that, when the moon is full and the curse takes hold, they will rage against an innocent bystander or loved one. As long as there is nothing around to threaten it or the natural area it protects (typically a forest), a werebear in its animal form is generally content to forage and sleep away the night.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Beast](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2), [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 21\r\n\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 21\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 19\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 16\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Werecreature_Werebear.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 4\">[Werebear](/Monsters.aspx?ID=412)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"LG\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Beast\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=20\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Human\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=90\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Werecreature\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=243\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 331</row>\n\n**Perception** +11; low-light vision, scent (imprecise) 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1); bear empathy\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +12, [Medicine](/Skills.aspx?ID=9) +9, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +11, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +11, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +11\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +5\r\n\r\n**Dex** +2\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** +1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** -1\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Bear Empathy** ([divination](/Traits.aspx?ID=47), [primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=134)) The werebear can communicate with ursines.\r\n\r\n**Items**\r\n[Chain Shirt](/Armor.aspx?ID=6), [Hatchet](/Weapons.aspx?ID=27) (8)\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 23 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +12 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +10 \r\n\r\n**Will** +10 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 75\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\nsilver 5\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 25 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nclaw +13 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 1d10+7 slashing plus Grab\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\ngreataxe +13 ([reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192), [Sweep](/Traits.aspx?ID=194)),\r\n**Damage** 1d12+7 slashing\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nhatchet +13 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Sweep](/Traits.aspx?ID=194)),\r\n**Damage** 1d6+7 slashing\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njaws +13 ([reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 1d12+7 piercing plus curse of the werebear\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nhatchet +10 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Sweep](/Traits.aspx?ID=194), [thrown 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=195)),\r\n**Damage** 1d6+7 slashing\n\n**[Change Shape](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=8)** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([Concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32), [Polymorph](/Traits.aspx?ID=127), [Primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=134), [Transmutation](/Traits.aspx?ID=157)) Medium human with fist +13 for 1d4+7 bludgeoning, or grizzly bear with Speed 35 feet.\r\n\r\n**Curse of the Werebear**  ([Curse](/Traits.aspx?ID=38), [Necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117), [Primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=134)) This curse affects only humanoids. **Saving Throw** DC 22 Fortitude save.
