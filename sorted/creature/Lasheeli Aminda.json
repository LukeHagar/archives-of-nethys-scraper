Lasheeli's family suffered the latter when they attracted divine attention and became the bearers of a curse, or so Lasheeli was always told. Born deep in the steaming jungles of Zuntisha, Lasheeli was the youngest child of a poor family with memories of noble blood. Hundreds of years ago, her mother claimed, a daughter of the Aminda family was chosen to become omwa. Omwa Daol remembered her family after her becoming rites and lavished her parents, siblings, and cousins with gifts. She built them a mansion of marble and pearl in the heart of Zuntisha. The Amindas sewed clothing from the finest materials, seasoned their food with the best spices, and were sought after as friends and lovers from those all over Zuntisha.\n\n The Amindas enjoyed many blessings, but it was because the omwa proved selfish and hoarded the best resources for her own household. She shirked her duties to the people of Zuntisha by uplifting her natal family above all others. She called for a heavy tax on goods and property, from which the Amindas were spared, and enforced it with vicious sellswords. Unhappy with this leadership, the people of Zuntisha petitioned heaven to choose a new omwa. Daol was cast out, stripped of her wings and enhancements, and removed of her title. She returned to the Aminda mansion in shame, diminished by heaven's judgment.\n\n Ever since, the Aminda name bore an ugly mark. The family's wealth dwindled over the generations and their mansion crumbled. Aminda matriarchs struggled to provide for their children and sold their ancestors' treasures to buy rice meal and dried fish. Their children were weak and prone to sickness, and never again was an omwa chosen from the Aminda line. Some Amindas became martyrs hoping to purge their familial curse. Lasheeli's own aunt and grandmother were among the ill-fated soldiers to follow Mastrien Slash into Geb.\n\n After generations of strife, Lasheeli's birth was a miracle. The first three Aminda children of her generation were sickly, but Lasheeli and her twin were born with radiant golden eyes and halo-like birthmarks encircling their dusky brows. As they grew, they displayed an innate talent for conjuring white fire that didn't burn. Outside the decaying mansion, all agreed the twins were touched by heaven's blessing and wondered whether the Aminda family was now ascending from their humbling decline.\n\n Growing up, Lasheeli was obedient and shy, while her twin was a firebrand with a magnetic personality. Lasheeli kept silent, making no promises out of fear of overpromising that which she didn't know, but her twin spoke out about Zuntisha's brilliant future. One by one the three eldest Amindas succumbed to illness, leaving the twins alone to inherit control of the household. But there was a complication: Lasheeli's sibling was the first Aminda in nearly a millennium to be chosen as omwa. Though she was born in a masculine body, Celeste Aminda completely transformed during her rites of becoming and chose her own name. Omwa Celeste defied Daol's memory by acting with kindness and intelligence. She treated all her people as family equal to her own.\n\n Lasheeli rejoiced for Celeste, but even as her family's fortunes were rising, she felt herself sinking into an abyss. Lasheeli was next in line to govern an entire household. With her family's status changing, Lasheeli faced situations she didn't understandâ€”social calls, trade negotiations, and financial decisions for over a dozen extended family members. She didn't have the busy Celeste to rely on. In her sleepless nights of obsessive prayer, Lasheeli experienced waking dreams of her grandmother and aunt, whom she had barely known. She decided to take a small retinue to Geb to recover their bodies, believing her ancestors could help guide her down the strange new path she found herself walking.\n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Campaign Role</title> Surprisingly, the journey to recover her petrified family members sparked growth in the young scion. In her taciturn childhood, Lasheeli always thought long and hard before speaking, often content to remain silent and let Celeste speak for both sisters. In the field, she no longer has this luxury, and she's responsible for issuing orders and gauging morale. To Lasheeli's surprise, however, her thoughtful pronouncements inspire those around her, and her retinue listens avidly when she recites the old stories of glory she learned on her mother's knee. She has to temper the passion these stories instill, however, since she hasn't come to the Field of Maidens to provoke any conflict, but to quietly find and recover her ancestors' statues. When the characters meet Lasheeli, she's coming into her authority and confidence. Her interactions with the characters are likely to put both to the test.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 37\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 35\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 32\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/LasheeliAminda.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 10\">[Lasheeli Aminda](/NPCs.aspx?ID=2099)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Unique\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=161\" />\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Aasimar\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=256\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Human\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=90\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #183: Field of Maidens](/Sources.aspx?ID=145) pg. 90</row>\n\n**Perception** +19; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Celestial](/Languages.aspx?ID=16), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Drooni](/Languages.aspx?ID=100)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +19, [Bardic Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +18, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +21, [Holomog Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +20, [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11) +20, [Performance](/Skills.aspx?ID=12) +21, [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13) +19, [Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14) +20\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +0\r\n\r\n**Dex** +3\r\n\r\n**Con** +0\r\n\r\n**Int** +4\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** +5\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Bardic Lore** Lasheeli can use [Bardic Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) to [Recall Knowledge](/Actions.aspx?ID=26) on any topic.\r\n\r\n**Items**\r\n_+1 [striking](/Equipment.aspx?ID=280) [returning](/Equipment.aspx?ID=301) [bola](/Weapons.aspx?ID=123)_, [Dagger](/Weapons.aspx?ID=3)\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 27 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +16 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +19 \r\n\r\n**Will** +19 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 127\n\n**Cautionary Tale** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> ([linguistic](/Traits.aspx?ID=101), verbal) **Trigger** Lasheeli or an ally within 30 feet attempts a Will save; **Effect** Lasheeli orates a line or two from one of her stories and makes a [Performance](/Skills.aspx?ID=12) check.
