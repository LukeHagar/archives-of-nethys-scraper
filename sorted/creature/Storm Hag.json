These crones hate those who huddle together with loved ones in warm, dry shelters while the wind howls and rain lashes the land and sea. Storm hags use their powers to wreak havoc on communities near the coastal caves or hovels where they often live.\n\n These hags send their voices on the wind to terrorize mortals before descending upon them with claws and fell magic. More than any others of their kind, they prey on the young, devouring children as much for the pain it causes their parents and caretakers as for the hags' love of young flesh.\n\n A storm hag's territory sometimes overlaps with that of [sea hags](/Monsters.aspx?ID=254) and [winter hags](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1187). While this may result in the formation of a coven that controls their combined territories, more often it leads to rivalries.
