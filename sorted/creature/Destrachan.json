Its forelimbs are armed with sharp curving claws, and its toothy, eyeless, tubular head has three hypersensitive frilled ears that turn toward any sound made in its vicinity. This cruel monster's true weapon, however, is an amplified version of the sonic cry that it uses to navigate, communicate, and hunt. It communicates with others of its kind through a complex series of clicks, shrieks, and whistles, but it is intelligent enough to understand other languages. Most destrachans understand at least one other language—usually Undercommon—and can often be reasoned with.\n\nAn obligate carnivore, the destrachan relishes fresh meat but won't hesitate to make a meal of carrion it finds in its path. When traveling in packs, the creatures take great delight in stalking travelers through miles of tunnels before attacking and subduing them, then devouring them alive.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Aberration](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11)): DC 24\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 22\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 19\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Destrachan.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 8\">[Destrachan](/Monsters.aspx?ID=605)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"CE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Aberration\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=1\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 71 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +20; echolocation 120 feet, no vision\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Destrachan](/Languages.aspx?ID=57), [Undercommon](/Languages.aspx?ID=11); can speak only Destrachan\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +18, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +15, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +18\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +6\r\n\r\n**Dex** +3\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** +3\r\n\r\n**Wis** +6\r\n\r\n**Cha** +3\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Echolocation** A destrachan can use its hearing as a [precise sense](/Rules.aspx?ID=411) at the listed range.\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 27 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +16 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +13 \r\n\r\n**Will** +18 \r\n\r\n+4 status bonus to all saves vs. sonic\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 135\n\n**Immunities**\r\n[blinded](/Conditions.aspx?ID=1), [visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=163)\r\n\r\n**Resistances**\r\nsonic 15\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 25 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njaws +20,\r\n**Damage** 2d8+10 piercing plus 1d8 sonic\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nclaw +20 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170)),\r\n**Damage** 2d8+10 slashing\n\n**Destructive Harmonics** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([Auditory](/Traits.aspx?ID=16), [Evocation](/Traits.aspx?ID=65), [Occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120), [Sonic](/Traits.aspx?ID=147)) The destrachan emits a harsh sonic cry that deals 9d6 sonic damage (DC 26 basic Reflex save) in either a 60-foot cone or a 30-foot burst.
