Appearing as hybrids of rats and crabs with grasping tentacles, these scheming fiends manipulate their victims over long spans of time, like pakalchis, to savor the most fear they can. Ximtals use subtlety to entrap their prey and often don't directly engage their targets. They use insecurities as a tool and force poor behavior in mortals they set their sights on.

These creatures often wander the multiverse seeking to sabotage societal crusades or suppress divergent ideologies.\n\n While most ximtals work alone, they sometimes enlist the assistance of pakalchis, who share similar tastes in mortal fear.
