In the dead of night, the flickering light of a yaganty’s fingertips casts dramatic shadows across their face and highlights their trollish visage.\n\n Yaganty fables follow a common formula.

The story ends in one of three ways: the traveler appeals to the yaganty with a gift of gold (the exact sum necessary varies wildly by the telling), the yaganty slays the traveler over some incomprehensible transgression, or, even more inexplicably, the yaganty offers the lost traveler five candles in simple charity so that the light might guide them home.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Fey](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 29\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 27\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 24\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Yaganty.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 10\">[Yaganty](/Monsters.aspx?ID=525)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"LN\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fey\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=69\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #153: Life's Long Shadows](/Sources.aspx?ID=29) pg. 85</row>\n\n**Perception** +20; greater darkvision\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Infernal](/Languages.aspx?ID=19), [Sylvan](/Languages.aspx?ID=10)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +23, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +21, [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11) +18, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +23\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +6\r\n\r\n**Dex** +5\r\n\r\n**Con** +5\r\n\r\n**Int** +2\r\n\r\n**Wis** +5\r\n\r\n**Cha** +7\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 29 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +23 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +17 \r\n\r\n**Will** +21 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 200\n\n**Resistances**\r\nfire 10\r\n\r\n**Weaknesses**\r\ncold iron 10\r\n\r\n**Light in the Darkness** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [light](/Traits.aspx?ID=100), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=134), [visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=163)) 60 feet.
