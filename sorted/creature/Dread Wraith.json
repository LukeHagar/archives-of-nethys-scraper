Like other wraiths, dread wraiths haunt the shadowy places of the world, but dread wraiths are more likely to travel greater distances to sow terror or amass influence, often sticking to dark glades or sinister ruins when journeying across sun-dappled lands. Dread wraiths tends to be arrogant and rarely form a pack with others of their kind, preferring instead to dominate groups of ordinary wraiths. A particularly powerful necromancer might compel packs of dread wraiths into service, however, while a particularly malevolent goal—such as to eradicate a bastion of light and life—might draw several dread wraiths together in a common purpose.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Undead](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 26\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 24\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 21\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Wraith_DreadWraith.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 9\">[Dread Wraith](/Monsters.aspx?ID=865)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"LE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Incorporeal\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=222\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Undead\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=160\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Wraith\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=260\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 298 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +19; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), [lifesense 60 feet](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=21)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Necril](/Languages.aspx?ID=20)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +19, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +21, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +19\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** -5\r\n\r\n**Dex** +6\r\n\r\n**Con** +3\r\n\r\n**Int** +3\r\n\r\n**Wis** +4\r\n\r\n**Cha** +6\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 28 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +16 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +19 \r\n\r\n**Will** +21 \r\n\r\n+1 status to all saves vs. positive\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 130\r\n([negative healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=42))\n\n**Immunities**\r\n[death](/Traits.aspx?ID=40) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126), precision, [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38)\r\n\r\n**Resistances**\r\nall 10 (except force, [_ghost touch_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=297), or positive; double resistance vs. non-magical)\n\n**Draining Presence** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [negative](/Traits.aspx?ID=118)) 10 feet.

If the creator of the wraith spawn dies, the wraith spawn becomes a full-fledged, autonomous wraith; it regains its free will and gains drain life and wraith spawn. Dread Wraith Origins The most unusual dread wraiths are those that coalesce from an amalgamation of evil spirits, often in regions where such spirits are shredded from their consciousnesses and churned in foci of negative energy, such as the Negative Energy Plane or on the Isle of Terror.
