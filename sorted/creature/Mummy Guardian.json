The traditional method of creating a mummy guardian is a laborious and sadistic process that begins well before the poor soul to be transformed is dead, during which the victim is ritualistically starved of nourishing food and instead fed strange spices, preservative agents, and toxins intended to quicken the desiccation of the flesh. The victim remains immobile but painfully aware during the final stages, where its now-useless entrails are extracted before it’s shrouded in funerary wrappings and entombed within a necromantically ensorcelled sarcophagus to await intrusions in the potentially distant future. While it’s certainly possible to use other methods to create a mummy guardian from an already-deceased body, those who seek to create these foul undead as their guardians in the afterlife often feel that such methods result in inferior undead—the pain and agony of death by mummification being an essential step in the process.\n\n Regardless of the method of their creation, mummy guardians are more than just physical shells of flesh and bone—they retain fragmented, distorted versions of their minds, with only enough memories of their living personality remaining to fuel their undead anger and jealousy of those who yet live. This burning rage only intensifies over the centuries of waiting within a crypt for the chance to actually act, and thus when most mummy guardians are awoken by tomb robbers or adventurers, they stop at nothing in pursuit of glorious slaughter.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Undead](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 22\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 20\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 17\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Mummy_MummyGuardian.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 6\">[Mummy Guardian](/Monsters.aspx?ID=304)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"LE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Mummy\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=228\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Undead\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=160\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 240</row>\n\n**Perception** +16; darkvision\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Necril](/Languages.aspx?ID=20); plus any one ancient language\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +15, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +11\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +4\r\n\r\n**Dex** +0\r\n\r\n**Con** +2\r\n\r\n**Int** -2\r\n\r\n**Wis** +4\r\n\r\n**Cha** +2\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 23 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +14 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +10 \r\n\r\n**Will** +16 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 110\r\n([negative healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=42))\n\n**Immunities**\r\ndeath effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, unconscious\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\nfire 5\r\n\r\n**Despair** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61), [fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=68), [incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=93), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) 30 feet.
