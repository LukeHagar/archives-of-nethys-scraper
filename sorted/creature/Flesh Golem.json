Though it has no mind, it can still go into a berserk rage when harmed, giving it a faint semblance of emotion. Flesh golems guard the laboratories and charnel houses of fleshwarpers and necromancers who feel no compunctions about desecrating corpses for their own ends. Though the first flesh golem is believed to have been a misguided attempt to create from simple base elements, these monstrosities are far from human. In isolated cases, echoes of a personality might rise in a flesh golem if the brain used as part of its construction belonged to a particularly powerful personality, but such tragic instances are (thankfully) rare in the extreme.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Construct](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2), [Crafting](/Skills.aspx?ID=4)): DC 26\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 24\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 21\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Golem_FleshGolem.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 8\">[Flesh Golem](/Monsters.aspx?ID=238)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Construct\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=35\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Golem\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=220\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Mindless\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=108\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 185</row>\n\n**Perception** +12; darkvision\r\n\r\n**Languages**\n\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +19\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +5\r\n\r\n**Dex** -1\r\n\r\n**Con** +3\r\n\r\n**Int** -5\r\n\r\n**Wis** +0\r\n\r\n**Cha** -5\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 26 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +18 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +14 \r\n\r\n**Will** +15 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 140\n\n**Immunities**\r\nbleed, disease, death effects, electricity, doomed, drained, fatigued, healing, magic (see below), mental, necromancy, nonlethal attacks, paralyzed, poison, sickened, unconscious\r\n\r\n**Resistances**\r\nphysical 5 (except adamantine)\n\n**Berserk** A severely damaged flesh golem has a chance of going berserk.
