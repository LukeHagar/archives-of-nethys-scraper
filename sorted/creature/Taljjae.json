While countless masks have been documented over the ages, the seven listed below are among those best known.\n\n **In Taljjae's Possession**: When Taljjae Changes Characters, it gains access to the listed abilities. Any items (such as weapons) associated with its previous mask immediately disappear and are replaced by fresh ones for its new mask, but the effects of any mask abilities it has active persist. Removing a mask and later reapplying it doesn't restore any limited-use abilities.\n\n **As Player Items**: Those who gain one of Taljjae's masks, either by defeating Taljjae or some other means, are known as its understudies and gain a fraction of its power. Each of Taljjae's masks is an 18th-level unique item with the invested and magical traits; if broken, they're automatically repaired to full HP when invested during daily preparations. The effect of a mask on a PC is noted in the mask's Understudy entry. Wearing one of Taljjae's masks also imposes Taljjae's jelly sense and jelly gluttony on the creature as long as it wears the mask. \n\n### The Beast\n With this mask, Taljjae assumes a low stance and gathers power.<br /> **Melee** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> jaws +35 ([deadly 3d12](/Traits.aspx?ID=174), [magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)), **Damage** 4d10+18 piercing plus [Knockdown](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=20)<br /> **Melee** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> claw +35 ([agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)), **Damage** 4d6+18 slashing<br /> [**Rend**](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=30) <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> claw \n\n---\n\n **Understudy** The Beast brings out its wearer's feral nature, granting it a claw melee [unarmed](/Traits.aspx?ID=199) attack that deals 1d4 slashing damage and has the [agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170) trait, or increasing the damage die of their claw unarmed attack from 1d4 to 1d6 damage if they have a claw unarmed attack that deals 1d4 damage. \n\n### The General\n Carved scars mark the face of this severe mask, which gives Taljjae the skill at arms of a veteran commander.<br /> **[Attack of Opportunity](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=3)** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> Taljjae disrupts actions on any hit, not just a critical hit.<br /> **Melee** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> glaive +35 ([deadly 3d8](/Traits.aspx?ID=174), [forceful](/Traits.aspx?ID=180), [magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [reach 15 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)), **Damage** 4d8+18 slashing plus 1d6 chaotic<br /> **Masterful Engagement** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> **Frequency** once per round; **Effect** Taljjae maintains the perfect distance between itself and its foe.

Serenity and a sense of ease blot out all other emotions.

Taljjae then attempts to [counteract](/Rules.aspx?ID=371) the spell with a counteract modifier of +27. **Divine Prepared Spells** DC 37, attack +29; **9th** [_dispel magic_](/Spells.aspx?ID=78), [_finger of death_](/Spells.aspx?ID=116) (×2), [_weapon of judgment_](/Spells.aspx?ID=372) (war only); **8th** [_spirit blast_](/Spells.aspx?ID=301) (×3), [_spiritual epidemic_](/Spells.aspx?ID=304); **7th** [_blade barrier_](/Spells.aspx?ID=24), _dispel magic_, [_flame strike_](/Spells.aspx?ID=120), [_spellwrack_](/Spells.aspx?ID=298); **Cantrips (8th)** [_detect magic_](/Spells.aspx?ID=66), [_divine lance_](/Spells.aspx?ID=84), [_forbidding ward_](/Spells.aspx?ID=126), [_produce flame_](/Spells.aspx?ID=236), [_shield_](/Spells.aspx?ID=280) \n\n---\n\n **Understudy** The Hermit allows its wearer to cast 8th-level _spirit blast_ and 7th-level _flame strike_, each as a divine innate spell, once per day. \n\n### The Hero\n The eyes of this female face seem to glint with determination.<br /> **Ranged** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> longbow +35 ([deadly 3d8](/Traits.aspx?ID=174), [magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [propulsive](/Traits.aspx?ID=191), [range increment 100 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=248), [volley](/Traits.aspx?ID=201)), **Damage** 4d8+14 piercing<br /> **Cometfall Arrow** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> Taljjae fires an arrow that could shoot a star from the sky. All creatures in a 120-foot line take 10d12 piercing damage (DC 37 [basic](/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Reflex save); on a critical failure, the target falls to the ground without taking falling damage, and it can't [Fly](/Actions.aspx?ID=94), [Leap](/Actions.aspx?ID=81), [_levitate_](/Spells.aspx?ID=170), or otherwise leave the ground until the end of Taljjae's next turn. Taljjae then can't use Cometfall Arrow for 1d4 rounds.<br /> **Double Shot** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> Taljjae fires two shots, making two Strikes, each against a separate target and with a –2 penalty. Both attacks count toward its multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after it makes both attacks. \n\n---\n\n **Understudy** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The Hero grants its wearer a +3 status bonus to attack rolls with [bows](/WeaponGroups.aspx?ID=3) for 1 minute. \n\n### The Nobleman\n This twisted mask mocks members of the nobility for their parasitic greed.<br /> **Parasitic Healing** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> **Trigger** A creature within 60 feet regains Hit Points; **Effect** Taljjae takes what should belong to another. The triggering creature regains only half the number of Hit Points, and Taljjae regains the full amount.<br /> **Covetous Confiscation** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> Taljjae holds out a hand and attempts to take something that doesn't belong to it. It telekinetically attracts an unattended, unsecured object of up to 5 Bulk within 100 feet. If the object is in a creature's possession, Taljjae must critically succeed at an attempt to [Disarm](/Actions.aspx?ID=41) that creature, but it can't critically fail. \n\n---\n\n **Understudy** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> **Frequency** once per 10 minutes; **Effect** The Nobleman allows its wearer to use Covetous Confiscation. \n\n### The Wanderer\n The slightly upturned smile of this mask depicts a sense of joy and wonder at travel and new experiences.<br /> **Melee** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> staff +35 ([magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192), [two-hand 1d8](/Traits.aspx?ID=198)), **Damage** 4d4+14 bludgeoning<br /> **Divine Innate Spells** DC 37; Constant (8th) [_air walk_](/Spells.aspx?ID=6), [_freedom of movement_](/Spells.aspx?ID=128), [_haste_](/Spells.aspx?ID=147)<br /> **Circling the Kingdom** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> Taljjae Strides twice and makes two quarterstaff Strikes at any point along its movement.<br /> **[Sneak Attack](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=34)** Taljjae deals an additional 2d6 precision damage to [flat-footed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=16) foes.<br /> **Waypoints** Taljjae leaves behind images of itself as it travels. Whenever it makes a Strike, it leaves behind a ghostly image of itself that lasts until the beginning of its next turn. These images block movement for Taljjae's enemies, and they provide flanking to Taljjae and its allies. \n\n---\n\n **Understudy** The Wanderer allows its wearer to cast 7th-level _air walk_ and 8th-level _freedom of movement_, each as a divine innate spell, once per day.\r\n</aside>",

In Taljjae's Possession : When Taljjae Changes Characters, it gains access to the listed abilities. Any items (such as weapons) associated with its previous mask immediately disappear and are replaced by fresh ones for its new mask, but the effects of any mask abilities it has active persist. Removing a mask and later reapplying it doesn't restore any limited-use abilities. As Player Items : Those who gain one of Taljjae's masks, either by defeating Taljjae or some other means, are known as its understudies and gain a fraction of its power.
