It must return to this location once per week and bury itself in the earth for 24 hours, during which time it is [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28) and can be beheaded.

Instead, it attempts to cast its spirit into an animal within 100 feet, which must attempt a Will save (DC 29). On a failure, the animal is possessed. This has the effects of the [_possession_](/Spells.aspx?ID=225) spell, but it lasts a number of days equal to the vrykolakas's level. This possession can't be counteracted with magic (though [_remove curse_](/Spells.aspx?ID=250) works against it normally).<br /> If the animal succeeds at its save, the vrykolakas can attempt to possess a different animal within 100 feet. If at any point an animal critically succeeds at its save or no animal is within 100 feet, the vrykolakas fails to possess anything and is destroyed.<br /> A vrykolakas possessing an animal seeks out its burial site (see Burial Site Bound) immediately, burying itself there. While the vrykolakas is in this state of recovery, its animal host is [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), and beheading it destroys the vrykolakas and kills its host. Removing the curse destroys the vrykolakas and returns the animal to normal. After 1d4 days, if the vrykolakas hasn't been destroyed, the animal dies and the vrykolakas rises in a new body that's identical to its previous one, formed from the animal's remains.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 40 feet, climb 20 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nfangs +23,\r\n**Damage** 2d12+13 piercing plus Drink Blood\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nclaw +23 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170)),\r\n**Damage** 2d8+13 slashing\r\n\r\n**Divine Innate Spells** DC 29\r\n- **3rd**\r\n[Fear](/Spells.aspx?ID=110) (×3)\r\n- **5th**\r\n[Vampiric Touch](/Spells.aspx?ID=354) (×3)\r\n\r\n**[Change Shape](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=8)** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([Concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32), [Divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [Polymorph](/Traits.aspx?ID=127), [Transmutation](/Traits.aspx?ID=157)) A vrykolakas master can transform into a form resembling the body it had in life, with the effects of [_humanoid form_](/Spells.aspx?ID=153) but with unlimited duration.

Such vrykolakas spawn are generally friendly to the vrykolakas that created them, but they are not under its control and typically wander off on their own rampage within 1d6 days of their creation.\r\n\r\n**Dominate Animal** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([Divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [Enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61), [Incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=93), [Mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) DC 29, The vrykolakas can cast [_dominate_](/Spells.aspx?ID=87) at will as a divine innate spell that affects only animals. A creature that succeeds is immune to that vrykolakas's Dominate Animal for 24 hours. Destroying the vrykolakas ends the effect, but reducing it to 0 HP does not. A dominated animal takes a –4 circumstance penalty to saving throws against the vrykolakas's Feral Possession.\r\n\r\n**Drink Blood** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([Divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [Necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) **Requirements** The vrykolakas' last action was a successful fangs Strike; **Effect** The vrykolakas sinks its fangs into that creature to drink its blood. This requires an [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) check against the creature's Fortitude DC. On a success, the creature becomes [drained 2](/Conditions.aspx?ID=10), and the vrykolakas regains 19 HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire, but it increases the creature's drained condition value by 1. A vrykolakas can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but it gains no HP from doing so.<br /> The target creature's drained condition value decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n**[Rend](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=30)** <actions string=\"Single Action\" />  claw\r\n\r\n</column>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"creature-family-159\" />",
