Failure The creature is blinded for 1 round. Critical Failure The creature is blinded for 1 hour. Suppress Aura Single Action (concentrate) The bright walker suppresses their light aura for 1 round, reducing it to a faint, ghostly glow of dim light. --- Speed fly 25 feet; landbound Melee Single Action radiant touch +21 (Agile, Finesse, Fire, Light, Magical), Damage 2d8+11 fire Ranged Single Action radiant ray +21 (Fire, Light, Magical, range increment 60 feet), Damage 2d6+11 fire Landbound A bright walker can't fly higher than 1 foot above the ground.

Light Flare Two Actions (Divine, Evocation, Fire, Light) Requirement The bright walker's Light Aura is suppressed; Effect The bright walker reignites their Light Aura with a burst of brightness that deals 5d6 fire damage (DC 25 basic Reflex save) to creatures within a 20-foot burst.

The bright walker can't use Shadow Jump again for 1d4 rounds. Bright Walker Formations Most calignis assume that bright walkers arise at the whims of their malign and capricious demigods, the Forsaken, but as the Forsaken are denied the souls of these undead, some other unknown force must be involved.
