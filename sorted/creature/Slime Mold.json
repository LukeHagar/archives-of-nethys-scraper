The fungus actually shares a symbiotic relationship with the slime mold, serving as an external digestive system while gaining access to the nutrients it needs. The ooze remains perfectly still until living prey passes within reach, then it lashes out with disgusting pseudopods. With a touch, a slime mold can infect its prey with a foul contagion known as slime rot, a horrific disease that painfully breaks down a victim's flesh. At first, the disease manifests as painful rashes and agonized joints. In the later stages, though, the flesh of the affected creature actually begins to liquefy and run in rivulets as the creature's spores continue to work. Death, when it occurs, swiftly causes the resulting body to split open and release a brand new slime mold.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Fungus](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 16\r\n\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Ooze](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11)): DC 16\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 14\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 11\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Ooze_SlimeMold.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 2\">[Slime Mold](/Monsters.aspx?ID=752)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fungus\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=77\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Mindless\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=108\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Ooze\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=122\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 193 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +6; motion sense 60 feet, no vision\r\n\r\n**Languages**\n\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +7, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +6\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +3\r\n\r\n**Dex** +0\r\n\r\n**Con** +5\r\n\r\n**Int** -5\r\n\r\n**Wis** +0\r\n\r\n**Cha** -5\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Motion Sense** A slime mold can sense nearby creatures through vibration and air or water movement.\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 12 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +11 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +3 \r\n\r\n**Will** +4 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 60\n\n**Immunities**\r\ncritical hits, [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), precision, [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38), [visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=163)\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 10 feet, climb 10 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\npseudopod +8,\r\n**Damage** 1d8+3 bludgeoning plus slime rot\n\n**Slime Rot**  ([Disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46)) **Saving Throw** DC 18 Fortitude; **Onset** 1d4 days; **Stage 1** [enfeebled 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=13) and [sickened 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=34) (1 day); **Stage 2** as stage 1 (1 day); **Stage 3** [drained 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=10), enfeebled 2, and sickened 2 (1 day); **Stage 4** as stage 3 (1 day); **Stage 5** drained 2 plus [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38) (no Perception check to wake up) (1 day); **Stage 6** dead, and the body erupts to release a new slime mold\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_5_TreasureAndRewards.png\">Slime Mold Fungi</title>\r\n\r\nThe particularly foul environments in which slime molds dwell are conducive to the growth of extremely potent and dangerous mushrooms and other fungi.
