If the target has a weakness to [cold iron](/Equipment.aspx?ID=272), Taviah gains a +2 circumstance bonus to this check. Unlike a normal Grapple, Taviah doesn't need to be within reach and can move as she pleases, and a successful attempt lasts until the creature [escapes](/Actions.aspx?ID=79) (DC 29), causing the cage to crumble into rust. Any creature can attempt to destroy the cage by attacking it; it has an AC of 19, Hardness 10, and 40 Hit Points.\r\n\r\n**Drain Thoughts** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([Divination](/Traits.aspx?ID=47), [Mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [Occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120)) **Requirements** A [grabbed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=20), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [restrained](/Conditions.aspx?ID=33), [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38), or willing creature is within Taviah's reach; **Effect** Taviah seizes a creature and consumes its memories. This requires an [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is [stupefied 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=37) (stupefied 2 if Taviah's Athletics check is a critical success), and Taviah regains 18 Hit Points, gaining any excess as temporary Hit Points. Draining Thoughts from a creature that is already stupefied doesn't restore any HP to Taviah but increases the victim's stupefied value by 1. Additionally, Taviah views one of the victim's memories, and can choose to alter, enhance, or erase the memory she views as a 4th-level [_modify memory_](/Spells.aspx?ID=200) spell. A victim's stupefied condition value decreases by 1 every week.\n\n A victim that becomes stupefied 5 in this way is rendered comatose until Taviah is destroyed, becoming permanently unconscious.

Instead, their body is destroyed, crumbling to ash, and their mind is immediately transferred into a creature they rendered comatose through Drain Thoughts. This creature must be within 1 mile; if no such creature is in range, the vetalarana is destroyed. The creature becomes [controlled](/Conditions.aspx?ID=6) by the vetalarana and loses the [stupefied](/Conditions.aspx?ID=37) and [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38) conditions. If the creature controlled by a vetalarana in this way is killed, the vetalarana's mind transfers to another creature within 1 mile who they rendered comatose through Drain Thoughts.\n\nAfter 1d6 days of being controlled, the controlled creature dies, and its body transforms into that of the vetalarana who rendered it comatose. When the characters arrive, Taviah has no comatose creatures to transfer her consciousness to.\r\n\r\n**Paralyzing Claws**  ([Incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=93), [Necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117), [Occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120)) Any living creature hit by Taviah's claw Strike must succeed at a DC 29 Fortitude save or become [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28). The target can attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns to end the effect, and the DC cumulatively decreases by 1 on each such save.\r\n\r\n**[Rend](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=30)** <actions string=\"Single Action\" />  claw\r\n\r\n</column>",
