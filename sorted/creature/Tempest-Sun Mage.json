They are known as much for the close bonds that they form with their companions as for their extensive knowledge of magical forces, and many mages inscribe the names of important allies on their clothing or gear as reminders of the reason for their vigilance and dedication. The diligence and power of the Tempest-Sun Mages has ensured that no invading force has ever come within 20 miles of the university they defend.\n\n When the Tempest-Sun Mages are not defending the academy itself or accompanying envoys or teachers to distant locales, they use their mastery of arcane and primal magic to keep watch in the surrounding city and beyond, keeping an eye on the balance of power throughout the whole of the Mwangi Expanse. This magical intelligence often allows them to foresee threats to the academy or any nearby towns before such threats can even organize and approach.\n\nWhile Tempest-Sun Mages generally prefer to disable or incapacitate enemies, and readily call upon on their companions from the Uzunjati to reason with foes when possible, they do not hesitate to unleash lethal force against dangerous or implacable enemies, often taking to the air and raining down elemental fury.
