They are known as much for the close bonds that they form with their companions as for their extensive knowledge of magical forces, and many mages inscribe the names of important allies on their clothing or gear as reminders of the reason for their vigilance and dedication. The diligence and power of the Tempest-Sun Mages has ensured that no invading force has ever come within 20 miles of the university they defend.\n\n When the Tempest-Sun Mages are not defending the academy itself or accompanying envoys or teachers to distant locales, they use their mastery of arcane and primal magic to keep watch in the surrounding city and beyond, keeping an eye on the balance of power throughout the whole of the Mwangi Expanse. This magical intelligence often allows them to foresee threats to the academy or any nearby towns before such threats can even organize and approach.\n\nWhile Tempest-Sun Mages generally prefer to disable or incapacitate enemies, and readily call upon on their companions from the Uzunjati to reason with foes when possible, they do not hesitate to unleash lethal force against dangerous or implacable enemies, often taking to the air and raining down elemental fury. In particular, these mages have little tolerance for demons, having previously suffered attacks from the worshippers of the demon lord [Angazhan](/Deities.aspx?ID=72) who inhabit the city of Usaro.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 28\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 26\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 23\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 11\">[Tempest-Sun Mage](/NPCs.aspx?ID=972)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"NG\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Human\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=90\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Character Guide](/Sources.aspx?ID=12) pg. 125 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +18\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Mwangi](/Languages.aspx?ID=39)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +18, [Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2) +23, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +16, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +16, [Magaambya Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +23, [Medicine](/Skills.aspx?ID=9) +19, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +21, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +21\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +0\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +3\r\n\r\n**Int** +5\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** +1\r\n</row>\r\n\r\nmask, _[staff of abjuration](/Equipment.aspx?ID=351)_\r\n\r\n**Items**\r\n[_+1 crossbow_](/Weapons.aspx?ID=67) (20 bolts), [_+1 explorer's clothing_](/Armor.aspx?ID=2), [_lesser healing potion_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=186), Magaambya mask, [_staff of abjuration_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=351)\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 28 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +19 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +20 \r\n\r\n**Will** +21 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 145\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\n_staff of abjuration_ +16 ([two-hand d8](/Traits.aspx?ID=198)),\r\n**Damage** 1d4+2 bludgeoning\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\n_crossbow_ +20 ([range increment 120 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=248), [reload 1](/Traits.aspx?ID=254)),\r\n**Damage** 1d8+2 piercing\r\n\r\n**Arcane Prepared Spells** DC 30, attack +20\r\n- **Cantrips (6th)**\r\n[Detect Magic](/Spells.aspx?ID=66), [Light](/Spells.aspx?ID=171), [Mage Hand](/Spells.aspx?ID=177), [Produce Flame](/Spells.aspx?ID=236), [Tanglefoot](/Spells.aspx?ID=330)\r\n- **1st**\r\n[Create Water](/Spells.aspx?ID=53), [Fleet Step](/Spells.aspx?ID=122), [Gust of Wind](/Spells.aspx?ID=143), [Unseen Servant](/Spells.aspx?ID=352)\r\n- **2nd**\r\n[Endure Elements](/Spells.aspx?ID=99), [False Life](/Spells.aspx?ID=108), [Obscuring Mist](/Spells.aspx?ID=210), [See Invisibility](/Spells.aspx?ID=271)\r\n- **3rd**\r\n[Haste](/Spells.aspx?ID=147), [Mind Reading](/Spells.aspx?ID=194), [Slow](/Spells.aspx?ID=289), [Stinking Cloud](/Spells.aspx?ID=309)\r\n- **4th**\r\n[Dimension Door](/Spells.aspx?ID=69), [Fly](/Spells.aspx?ID=125), [Freedom of Movement](/Spells.aspx?ID=128), [Wall of Fire](/Spells.aspx?ID=362)\r\n- **5th**\r\n[Cone of Cold](/Spells.aspx?ID=47), [Fireball](/Spells.aspx?ID=119), [Sending](/Spells.aspx?ID=272), [Wall of Stone](/Spells.aspx?ID=365)\r\n- **6th**\r\n[Chain Lightning](/Spells.aspx?ID=33), [Tangling Creepers](/Spells.aspx?ID=331), [Elemental Form](/Spells.aspx?ID=98)\r\n\r\n**Wizard School Spells** DC 30,  2 Focus Points\r\n- **6th**\r\n[Elemental Tempest](/Spells.aspx?ID=527), [Force Bolt](/Spells.aspx?ID=529)\r\n\r\n**Mask Bond** <actions string=\"Free Action\" /> ([Arcane](/Traits.aspx?ID=11)) **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** The Tempest-Sun Mage has not acted yet on their turn; **Effect** The Tempest-Sun Mage expends the power stored in their bonded item, which is their mask.
