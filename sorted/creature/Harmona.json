A soft buzz accompanies them, discernible only to creatures with particularly keen hearing.\n\n Intelligent and curious, these tiny fey birds freely roam the [First World](/Planes.aspx?ID=10), accompanying high-ranking fey creatures such as queens or their courts. In turn, companions who treat a harmona with respect for their knowledge and skill benefit from the harmona's aid in times of need.\n\n When these curious creatures find a natural gate between the planes, they glide through to explore and expand their knowledge. Those who find their way onto the [Material Plane](/Planes.aspx?ID=1) often choose to remain there in search of diverse and unusual places. This frequently leads them to the same locations that draw in curious adventurers.
