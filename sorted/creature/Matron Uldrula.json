The creature then becomes temporarily immune to soul lock for 24 hours.<br /> **Failure** Matron Uldrula locks the creature's soul in her staff. If the creature is living, it dies. If the creature is a corporeal [undead](/Traits.aspx?ID=160), its body becomes an inanimate corpse. If the creature is an [incorporeal](/Traits.aspx?ID=222) undead, it becomes bodily trapped within the staff.

Though she used logic and emotional arguments whenever possible, she relied upon her staff and powerful magic to forcefully capture souls when words failed. Uldrula would've remained on this path if not for her devotion to Narakaas, the Cleansing Sentence. In time, Uldrula entered Narakaas's service, working as an archivist and later manager at a small soul repository located on the borders of Narakaas's realm: Reprieve. While there, Uldrula cataloged not only the souls in Reprieve's care but also the reason for their arrival. The endeavor sparked a change in the old shoki. After eons as a dispassionate arbiter of fate, Uldrula allowed feelings to interfere with her work. She adopted the mantle “Matron,” and the souls became “her wards.” And, the predators that harmed souls became her enemies. For millennia, Matron Uldrula lobbied her superior, Arbiter Alcrazaal, to dispatch psychopomp assassins to destroy the most heinous soul predators, but her arguments were regularly written off as rash, emotional, and illogical. Sensing her time at Reprieve is nearing its end and desperate to spare countless souls any unnecessary harm, Matron Uldrula has resorted to considering drastic measures to see her enemies destroyed once and for all. During her darkest moments, she has considered traveling the planes to dispatch as many soul predators as she can before Arbiter Alcrazaal catches her and ends her life. Matron Uldrula is a hunchbacked shoki with a pearlescent snail-like shell on her back, frazzled gray hair, and the countenance of a wise old woman. Wrinkles and worry line her face, her gap-toothed smile is cunning but kindly, and she has expressive gold eyes—though such affectations are typically feigned among shokis, Matron Uldrula's are genuine. Her gray skin is webbed with scars, which appear as tiny gold lines in irregular patterns like cracks in broken pottery. She leans heavily on an adamantine staff from which dangles a lantern containing a blue-white wisp of light. Though she hides it well, Matron Uldrula is weary. Campaign Role Although Matron Uldrula is opposed to the PCs' presence in her soul repository, she has spent eons bargaining with desperate souls and is intrigued enough to allow the PCs to speak in their defense before she reaps their souls. If the PCs are honest with Matron Uldrula, Matron Uldrula becomes an ally of the PCs, giving them Balji's soul in exchange for the death of Kemnebi and providing them information on Arbiter Alcrazaal, who she knows will stand against them. If the PCs are dishonest, Matron Uldrula becomes a terrifying foe, willing to die in defense of her wards and trusting reinforcements are on the way.

This staff becomes a +2 greater striking staff and is treated as if it were adamantine while Matron Uldrula wields it. Matron Uldrula's staff has Hardness 17 and HP 68 (BT 34) while possessed by her, or Hardness 5 and HP 20 (BT 10) while out of her possession. If her staff is taken or destroyed, Matron Uldrula can infuse a new one with an hour of work. Soul Lock Two Actions (Divine, Incapacitation, Necromancy) Requirements Matron Uldrula doesn't have a soul locked within her staff; Effect Matron Uldrula attempts to capture the soul of a creature on the brink of death, either an undead creature or a creature with the dying condition. The target must attempt a DC 46 Will save with the following results. Critical Success The creature is unaffected and becomes temporarily immune to Soul Lock. Success Matron Uldrula's staff tugs at the creature's soul but doesn't trap it. If the creature is living, it becomes doomed 1 (or increases its doomed condition by 1). If the creature is a corporeal undead, it becomes enfeebled 2. If the creature is an incorporeal undead, it becomes stupefied 2. The creature then becomes temporarily immune to soul lock for 24 hours. Failure Matron Uldrula locks the creature's soul in her staff. If the creature is living, it dies. If the creature is a corporeal undead, its body becomes an inanimate corpse. If the creature is an incorporeal undead, it becomes bodily trapped within the staff. While the soul is locked in the staff, the target can't be returned to life or undeath, or rejuvenated through any means, save powerful magic, such as miracle or wish , or through divine intervention. If Matron Uldrula's staff is destroyed or she wills it, the soul is released. Matron Uldrula's staff can only hold one soul at a time. Spirit Touch Matron Uldrula's Strikes affect incorporeal creatures with the effects of a ghost touch property rune and deal 4d6 negative damage to living creatures and 4d6 positive damage to undead.
