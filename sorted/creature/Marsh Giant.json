They prefer to eat the flesh of those they slay in battle, but many are also cannibals. It is perhaps this vicious behavior that keeps the creatures in check, for if a fellow marsh giant becomes too dangerous and powerful, it runs the risk of being ambushed and consumed by its clan.\n\n Marsh giants are insular and mysterious, dedicating much of their lives to zealous worship of sea-dwelling deities or stranger entities. While there is no central religion followed by all marsh giants, many are known to venerate the demon lord [Dagon](/Deities.aspx?ID=75), while others worship even more powerful monstrosities from the Elder Mythos, such as distant, dreaming Cthulhu.\n\n Only rarely do more than a dozen marsh giants settle together in a location, but when they do it is often for a religious purpose. Whatever call from the deep draws them together also tugs at nearby creatures such as boggards or skum, who look upon marsh giants in fear and reverence. The grim, terrifying chants and screams coming from such an encampment are a sure sign of terror to come for any other residents of the area.\n\n Barely topping 11 feet tall and 1,000 pounds, marsh giants are small for giants but make up for their relatively diminutive stature with their zealotry.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 24\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 22\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 19\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Giant_MarshGiant.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 8\">[Marsh Giant](/Monsters.aspx?ID=679)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"CE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Amphibious\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=207\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Giant\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=79\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 125 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +16; [low-light vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=23)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Aklo](/Languages.aspx?ID=13), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Jotun](/Languages.aspx?ID=8)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +18, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +15, [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13) +17\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +6\r\n\r\n**Dex** +3\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** +0\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** +1\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n_+1 [striking](/Equipment.aspx?ID=280) [gaff](/Weapons.aspx?ID=121)_, [sack with 5 rocks](/Equipment.aspx?ID=45)\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 27 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +18 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +13 \r\n\r\n**Will** +17 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 150\n\n**[Catch Rock](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=7)** <actions string=\"Reaction\" />\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 35 feet, swim 20 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\ngaff +20 ([Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192), [Trip](/Traits.aspx?ID=196), [versatile P](/Traits.aspx?ID=200)),\r\n**Damage** 2d6+14 bludgeoning\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nfist +20 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 2d6+14 bludgeoning\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nrock +20 ([Brutal](/Traits.aspx?ID=249), [range increment 120 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=248)),\r\n**Damage** 2d6+14 bludgeoning\r\n\r\n**Occult Innate Spells** DC 23\r\n- **2nd**\r\n[Augury](/Spells.aspx?ID=15), [Obscuring Mist](/Spells.aspx?ID=210)\r\n- **5th**\r\n[Mariner's Curse](/Spells.aspx?ID=184)\r\n\r\n**Hook Shake** <actions string=\"Single Action\" />  **Requirements** A creature adjacent to the marsh giant is [prone](/Conditions.aspx?ID=31) in water at least 1 foot deep; **Effect** The marsh giant uses its gaff to shake the creature back and forth and hold it underwater.
