They have a special talent for manipulation—feeding listeners' worst impulses and prejudices, telling them what their prey most want to hear, and twisting their perceptions to suit the japalisuras' own ends. All this occurs from behind a veil, though, for japalisuras are grotesque fiends with six arms, infinite faces, and an obsession with the profane.\n\n The first japalisura rose from the remains of three demigod archers, sons of a goddess who feared their rise to power and slew them. Their merged form was so terrifying that they struck a deal with a powerful asura rana to alter their face into something more pleasing.
