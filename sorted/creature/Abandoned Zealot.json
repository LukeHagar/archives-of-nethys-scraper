Consumed by self-loathing for the lives they squandered to false faiths and empty creeds, these lost souls serve as terrifying and implacable—yet ultimately pathetic—foes. A shapeless mass of smoke and shadow coils behind their broken masks. As abandoned zealots move, they spit and shriek a hateful cacophony of bitter lamentations and anguished weeping.\n\n Abandoned zealots are most commonly associated with the church of Razmir, which upholds a mortal wizard as a god—a truth unknown to most worshippers. However, abandoned zealots might arise from a true religion if they've been misled about that faith's true tenets or aims.
