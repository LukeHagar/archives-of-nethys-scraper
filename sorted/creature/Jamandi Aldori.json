She quickly mastered the art of the Aldori sword, and over the years has become one of Restov's most well-known swordlords, in part due to her skill in dueling, but of late as a result of her increasingly obvious pushes to expand Restov's power in directions that minimize reliance upon the rest of Brevoy. Beyond organizing the push into the Stolen Lands and her desire to foster a new ally to the south, she hopes some day to found additional dueling schools beyond Brevoy's borders where the Aldori style can be taught—a pursuit that not all of her peers equally approve of.\n\n Characters who earn Jamandi's trust and support can unlock access to the [Aldori duelist](/Archetypes.aspx?ID=14) archetype at your option.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 42\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 40\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 37\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/JamandiAldori.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 14\">[Jamandi Aldori](/NPCs.aspx?ID=2195)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Unique\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=161\" />\r\n<trait label=\"CG\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Elf\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=58\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Human\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=90\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Kingmaker Adventure Path](/Sources.aspx?ID=150) pg. 599</row>\n\n**Perception** +23; [low-light vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=23)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Elven](/Languages.aspx?ID=4), [Hallit](/Languages.aspx?ID=37)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +29, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +27, [Restov Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +23, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +24, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +26, [Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14) +23\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +3\r\n\r\n**Dex** +5\r\n\r\n**Con** +2\r\n\r\n**Int** +1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** +4\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n_+1 [resilient](/Equipment.aspx?ID=279) [breastplate](/Armor.aspx?ID=10)_, [_daredevil boots_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=429), _+2 [striking](/Equipment.aspx?ID=280) [Aldori dueling sword](/Weapons.aspx?ID=88)_\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 36 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +23 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +27 \r\n\r\n**Will** +24 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 260\n\n**[Attack of Opportunity](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=3)** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> \r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 25 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\n_Aldori dueling sword_ +29 ([Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179), [versatile P](/Traits.aspx?ID=200)),\r\n**Damage** 2d8+9 slashing\n\n**Aldori Parry** <actions string=\"Single Action\" />  **Requirement** Jamandi wields only an Aldori dueling sword and her other hand is free; **Effect** Jamandi parries attacks against her with her sword, and gains a +2 circumstance bonus to her AC until the start of her next turn as long as she continues to meet the requirement.\r\n\r\n**Aldori Riposte** <actions string=\"Reaction\" />  **Requirements** Jamandi is benefiting from Aldori Parry; **Trigger** An opponent within Jamandi's reach critically fails a Strike against her; **Effect** Jamandi ripostes with her sword and makes a melee Strike or uses a [Disarm](/Actions.aspx?ID=41) action against the triggering opponent.\r\n\r\n**Saving Slash** <actions string=\"Reaction\" />  **Trigger** an opponent critically hits Jamandi with a melee attack; **Effect** Jamandi whirls her blade, trying to deflect enough momentum to avoid the worst of the attack.
