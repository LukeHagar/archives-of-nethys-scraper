As she grew, she began to learn stone-binding, with an eye toward earning her place as a stoneliege, a rare and prestigious position. Such was her desire for power, however, that moments after she completed the ritual to become a stoneliege, she threatened the alchemist who performed the ritual and demanded he teach her all he knew of mixing chemicals and warping flesh. Thessekka proved an eager and intelligent student, and once she had exhausted the alchemist's knowledge, she killed and ate him. But this, too, failed to fill the ravenous void within her. When rumors of an invasion of the sun-blighted surface rippled among xulgath tribes, Thessekka knew she had found a mission that might finally satisfy her.\n\n Thessekka bullied a few minions into joining this invasion force alongside her, but she lacked the influence of a true leader. Instead she was given the position of a hardscale, a subsidiary position below Surkitama, a leader in her clutch. Surkitama's force was assigned to a surface region called the Swardlands, where three aeon towers stood that held _aeon orbs_ stolen from the xulgaths five millennia ago. Surkitama's force was to secure these towers from uplander interference before finding a way to crack the stolen orbs to bring destruction to the surface world. Always looking for opportunities to seize power, Thessekka used the journey to gather misfits to her side, including the dero [Ginjana Mindkeeper](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2109) and the roper Ro'oosk. She also won the trust of a duergar explorer, eyeing his useful magical ring, only to kill him and take the ring for herself.\n\n Surkitama's force moved swiftly upon reaching the Swardlands, locating and securing the three aeon towers. By this time, Thessekka had risen in prominence enough to command one of the tower garrisons. She quickly established a hold over her assigned garrison, the Wellspring Tower, and set up an alchemist laboratory within it. Without much oversight from Surkitama, who had underestimated the difficulty of travel among the towers and was preoccupied with trying (and failing) to conquer the Swardlands, Thessekka devised a way to siphon the _aeon orb's_ energy even as Surkitama's leadership began to falter. Thessekka used her _[ring of stoneshifting](/Equipment.aspx?ID=634)_ to secretly journey between the towers and foment rebellion in the discontented clutches under Surkitama's command.\n\nWhen golems at the Liferoot Stone decimated the xulgath garrison there, Thessekka knew her time to strike was at hand. Traveling via the _ring of stoneshifting_, she rallied her disgruntled allies to move against Surkitama's loyalists. Able to appear and disappear in an instant, she prevented the xulgath leader from bringing the full force of his power to bear against her. And when the shadowy form of a dero slipped unseen into Surkitama's personal chambers, Surkitama became just another of Ginjana's experiments, and Thessekka stepped into the power vacuum to lead all the xulgaths in the Swardlands. By the time her xulgath superiors discovered her coup, Thessekka's efforts to siphon the Wellspring Tower _aeon orb_ were proving successful, so she was given official command of the Swardland forces. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Campaign Role</title> Thessekka is the true mastermind behind the xulgaths in the Swardlands. Once she has drained away the energy of all the _aeon orbs_ and met her obligations to her xulgath masters, she plans to carve out her own surface world kingdom. She sees the soft humanoids who currently inhabit the Swardlands as mere cattle for her consumption, and she plans to subjugate them as the bountiful land that has sustained them dies. With her _ring of stoneshifting_, Thessekka can move freely between the three aeon towers and directly oversee operations. At first, she dismisses the heroes as too feeble and too few in number to pose a real threat, and she keeps her focus on other towers. By the time the heroes prove themselves a true threat by clearing the xulgaths out of two aeon towers, Thessekka realizes that dismissing them was a mistake. She confronts them at the final tower, where she plans to end their threat and devour their charred corpses.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 42\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 40\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 37\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 14\">[Thessekka](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2111)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Unique\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=161\" />\r\n<trait label=\"CE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Xulgath\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=244\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #153: Life's Long Shadows](/Sources.aspx?ID=29) pg. 90</row>\n\n**Perception** +26; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), [tremorsense](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=40) (imprecise) 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Aklo](/Languages.aspx?ID=13), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Draconic](/Languages.aspx?ID=2), [Undercommon](/Languages.aspx?ID=11)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2) +24, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +28, [Crafting](/Skills.aspx?ID=4) +28, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +23, [Medicine](/Skills.aspx?ID=9) +24, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +22, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +22\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +6\r\n\r\n**Dex** +1\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** +4\r\n\r\n**Wis** +2\r\n\r\n**Cha** +1\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Infused Items** Thessekka carries the following infused items: 1 [greater acid flask](/Equipment.aspx?ID=74), 2 [greater alchemist's fires](/Equipment.aspx?ID=75), 1 [moderate bravo's brew](/Equipment.aspx?ID=84), 2 [greater frost vials](/Equipment.aspx?ID=77), 1 [greater quicksilver mutagen](/Equipment.aspx?ID=277), 1 [greater tanglefoot bag](/Equipment.aspx?ID=78).
