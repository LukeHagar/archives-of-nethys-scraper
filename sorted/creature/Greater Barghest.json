As barghests have no innate ability to travel the planes, though, the time it takes for most greater barghests to engineer such a return can usually be measured in years, if not decades. During that time, greater barghests continue to play the roles of gluttons, hunters of humanity, and tyrants of goblinoid tribes. More than a few grow accustomed to such lives on the Material Plane and wholly abandon the end goal of returning to the Abyss, despite the fact that those who do make such a return home often grow even more powerful over time, gaining eerie new abilities and qualities absorbed from the raw chaos of the Abyss itself.\n\n In addition to greater barghests being more powerful than typical barghests, the process of transforming into a greater barghest results in hideous mutations that often grant deadly abilities. Some barghests grow large bat-like wings upon their transformation. Others develop toxic breath or vestigial limbs. The options detailed in the stats below represent only the tip of the proverbial iceberg for barghest mutations—feel free to use these as inspiration for coming up with new mutations of your own design.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Fiend](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 25\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 23\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 20\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Barghest_GreaterBarghest.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 7\">[Greater Barghest](/Monsters.aspx?ID=43)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"CE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fiend\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=70\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Mutant\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=229\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 37</row>\n\n**Perception** +16; darkvision, scent (imprecise) 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Abyssal](/Languages.aspx?ID=12), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Goblin](/Languages.aspx?ID=6)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +15, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +15, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +18, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +14, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +16, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +15, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +14\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +6\r\n\r\n**Dex** +2\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** +3\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** +5\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 25 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +17 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +15 \r\n\r\n**Will** +12 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 105\n\n**Resistances**\r\n[fire](/Traits.aspx?ID=72) 10, physical 10 (except [magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103))\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\ngood 5, lawful 5\r\n\r\n**[Attack of Opportunity](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=3)** <actions string=\"Reaction\" />\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 35 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njaws +17,\r\n**Damage** 2d10+6 piercing\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nclaw +17 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170)),\r\n**Damage** 2d8+6 slashing\r\n\r\n**Divine Innate Spells** DC 25\r\n- **1st**\r\n[Charm](/Spells.aspx?ID=34)\r\n- **2nd**\r\n[Invisibility](/Spells.aspx?ID=164) (at will)\r\n- **3rd**\r\n[Levitate](/Spells.aspx?ID=170) (at will)\r\n- **4th**\r\n[Blink](/Spells.aspx?ID=27) (at will), [Confusion](/Spells.aspx?ID=48), [Dimension Door](/Spells.aspx?ID=69), [Enlarge](/Spells.aspx?ID=102)\r\n\r\n**[Change Shape](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=8)** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([Concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32), [Divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [Polymorph](/Traits.aspx?ID=127), [Transmutation](/Traits.aspx?ID=157)) The barghest takes on the shape of a goblinoid (a goblin, hobgoblin, or bugbear) or a wolf, or it transforms back into its true form.
