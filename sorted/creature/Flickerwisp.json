Like their more dangerous kin, flickerwisps prefer to haunt lonely swamps or stretches of lonely rivers or creeks, particularly near the shorelines where they can pass themselves off as nothing more than a small gathering of fireflies. A flickerwisp's body is a 3-foot-long length of hair-like fibers that flashes and pulses with ribbons and points of eerie yellow light as the creature flits through the air.\n\n While a flickerwisp can taste fear, and finds the flavor delectable, it does not feed on this emotion. Instead, flickerwisps subsist on confusion and doubt. The sense of unease a traveler exudes when they become lost in the woods is flickerwisps' favorite repast. They can sip from this sense of disorientation without betraying their presence or harming their prey. Eventually, the flickerwisps grow too hungry and are compelled to flit closer, confuse their prey, and glut on the raw emotions. Flickerwisps do their best to swoop away before death occurs, and the most skilled of these tormentors can keep a chosen meal alive for days, sipping from confusion in small doses.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Aberration](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11)): DC 18\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 16\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 13\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Wisp_Flickerwisp.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 2\">[Flickerwisp](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1036)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"CE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Small\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Aberration\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=1\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Air\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=5\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #163: Ruins of Gauntlight](/Sources.aspx?ID=71) pg. 83</row>\n\n**Perception** +9; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Aklo](/Languages.aspx?ID=13), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +8, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +7, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +5, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +8\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** -5\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +0\r\n\r\n**Int** +0\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** +1\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 20 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +6 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +10 \r\n\r\n**Will** +7 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 18\n\n**Immunities**\r\nmagic\n\n**Glow** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [light](/Traits.aspx?ID=100)) 5 feet.
