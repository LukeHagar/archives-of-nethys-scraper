If the new vampire is lower level than its creator, it is under the creator’s control. If a vampire controls too many spawn at once (as determined by the GM), strong-willed spawn can free themselves by succeeding at a Will saving throw against the vampire’s Will DC.\r\n\r\n**Dominate** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([Divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [Enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61), [Incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=93), [Mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [Visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=163)) The vampire can cast [_dominate_](/Spells.aspx?ID=87) (DC 26) at will as a divine innate spell. Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the visual trait. A creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that vampire's Dominate for 24 hours.

This gives the vampire the ability to cast one prepared spell it had already previously cast today, without spending a spell slot. The vampire must still Cast the Spell and meet the spell’s other requirements.\r\n\r\n**Drink Blood** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([Divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [Necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) **Requirement** A [grabbed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=20), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [restrained](/Conditions.aspx?ID=33), [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38), or willing creature is within the vampire's reach. **Effect** The vampire sinks its fangs into that creature to drink its blood. This requires an [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is [drained 2](/Conditions.aspx?ID=10) and the vampire regains 10 HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire but increases the victim's drain value by 1. A vampire can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but it gains no HP from doing so.<br /> A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a DC 20 [Medicine](/Skills.aspx?ID=9) check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drain by 1 after 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n**Steady Spellcasting**   If another creature’s reaction would disrupt the vampire mastermind’s spellcasting action, the vampire attempts a DC 15 flat check. If the vampire succeeds, its action isn’t disrupted.\r\n\r\n**Turn to Mist** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([Concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32), [Divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [Transmutation](/Traits.aspx?ID=157)) The vampire turns into a cloud of vapor, as the gaseous form spell, or back to its normal form. The vampire loses fast healing while in gaseous form. The vampire can remain in this form indefinitely.\r\n\r\n</column>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"creature-family-97\" />",
