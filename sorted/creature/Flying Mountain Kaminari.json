The kaminari unleashes four 20-foot bursts within 60 feet with the effects of a 9th-level [_wall of wind_](/Spells.aspx?ID=367). In addition, a creature that enters one of the bursts takes 6d6 slashing damage (DC 40 [basic](/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Reflex save). The bursts can't overlap. After using this activity the kaminari can't use Hurricane Bag for 1d4 rounds. <br />If a kaminari creates a column of lighting using Thunder Drums that intersects one of the areas of the wind, the wind explodes in a peal of thunder, dealing 6d10 sonic damage to creatures in the area of that wall of wind burst.

The kaminari establishes a connection with another kaminari within 150 feet, and lightning and thunder form a line between the centers of their spaces. For the next minute, a creature that begins its turn in the line or enters the line on its turn takes 4d12 electricity damage (DC 40 [basic](/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Reflex save). A creature can take this damage only once per round, even if it moves through several tempest tethers. If the distance between the kaminari ever exceeds 150 feet, the tether breaks.\r\n\r\n**Thunder Drums** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([Electricity](/Traits.aspx?ID=56)) The peal of a kaminari's drums bring thunder and lightning. The kaminari summons four 100-foot-tall columns of lightning to strike in 5-foot bursts within 60 feet. These columns can't overlap. Creatures in the burst take 8d12 electricity damage and must attempt a DC 40 Reflex save. The kaminari can't use Thunder Drums again for 1d4 rounds. <br />**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected. <br />**Success** The target takes half damage. <br />**Failure** The target takes full damage and is [stunned 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=36). <br />**Critical Failure** The target takes double damage and is stunned 2.\r\n\r\n</column>",
