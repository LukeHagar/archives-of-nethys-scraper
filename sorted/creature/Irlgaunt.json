Their jagged gray shells allow them to blend into the rocky walls of the high mountain passes and deep ravines that serve as their hunting grounds. Despite their size, they move with incredible alacrity, bounding across chasms and skittering up sheer mountain cliffs without pause. Though they are formidable in melee, irlgaunts have an even more powerful ranged attack. These creatures can pelt their opponents by forcefully regurgitating gastroliths—melon-sized clusters of rocks enveloped in coagulated digestive enzymes strong enough to break down flesh and bone. Gastroliths are fragile and explode on contact, spraying the area with shards of rock and caustic acid.\n\n While one might easily mistake an irlgaunt for a simple brutish beast, they have a keen intelligence and use devious hunting strategies. They set traps for travelers and are fond of using gems and magical items taken from previous victims as bait. They have been known to start rockslides or otherwise block passages to reroute explorers into their clutches. They also use their gastroliths to direct the movements of their prey, forcing victims into dead ends at the edge of chasms or cliffs.\n\n For the most part, irlgaunts live solitary lives, likely because finding enough food to sustain a community tends to be difficult. However, they still maintain a sense of extended, regional community, actively gathering when organizing for war or to discuss other issues that affect their species or shared territories. They have been known to occasionally ally with giants, but these truces are usually nebulous.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Aberration](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11)): DC 31\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 29\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 26\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Irlgaunt.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 13\">[Irlgaunt](/Monsters.aspx?ID=704)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Aberration\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=1\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Earth\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=55\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 148 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +24; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Aklo](/Languages.aspx?ID=13), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Jotun](/Languages.aspx?ID=8), [Terran](/Languages.aspx?ID=22)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +25, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +26, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +23, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +27, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +22\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +7\r\n\r\n**Dex** +8\r\n\r\n**Con** +5\r\n\r\n**Int** +4\r\n\r\n**Wis** +5\r\n\r\n**Cha** +4\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 34 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +22 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +25 \r\n\r\n**Will** +24 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 265\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\nbludgeoning 10\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 30 feet, climb 30 feet; stone step\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njaws +26,\r\n**Damage** 3d8+13 piercing plus 2d6 acid\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nlegs +26 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170)),\r\n**Damage** 3d10+13 bludgeoning\r\n\r\n**Primal Innate Spells** DC 31\r\n- **4th**\r\n[Meld into Stone](/Spells.aspx?ID=188) (at will), [Shape Stone](/Spells.aspx?ID=276) (at will)\r\n- **6th**\r\n[Stone Tell](/Spells.aspx?ID=310)\r\n\r\n**Regurgitate Gastrolith** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([Acid](/Traits.aspx?ID=3), [Evocation](/Traits.aspx?ID=65), [Primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=134)) The irlgaunt violently regurgitates a melonsized clot of brittle stone supernaturally infused with digestive enzymes.
