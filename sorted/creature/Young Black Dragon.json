Gleefully sadistic, they rule their fetid principalities from a deep cave or otherwise isolated part of the swamp with a mix of lightning-quick raids and subterfuge. Their hatred for other creatures is as acidic as their breath weapons, and they rarely tolerate even other dragons of their kind—except perhaps to mate or temporarily collaborate to take down a mutual enemy.\n\n Black dragons are amphibious—although they breathe air, their gills also allow them to breathe water. Their frills and fins make them accomplished swimmers, well suited to their wetland environments and submerged lairs. They’re immune to the fetid water that comes as a result of their magical ability to corrupt water.\n\n Black dragon lairs are as foul as their souls. The floors are littered with rotting meat, and plundered treasures line the muck and slime of their dank caves amid twisted roots and creepers. Such places are often crawling with pests, snakes, and slimes. Though they claim natural caverns when they can, they make do with areas of dense, twisted vegetation within a swamp. Black dragon treasure hoards primarily consist of gems and expensive glass work, as valuables of softer substance can’t survive the dragon’s acidic presence.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Dragon](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2)): DC 23\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 21\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 18\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 7\">[Young Black Dragon](/Monsters.aspx?ID=127)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"CE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Acid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=3\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Amphibious\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=207\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Dragon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=50\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 105</row>\n\n**Perception** +15; darkvision, scent (imprecise) 60 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Draconic](/Languages.aspx?ID=2)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +14, [Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2) +12, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +17, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +15, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +15, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +16\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +6\r\n\r\n**Dex** +3\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** +1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +2\r\n\r\n**Cha** +2\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 25 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +17 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +12 \r\n\r\n**Will** +15 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 125\n\n**Immunities**\r\nacid, paralyzed, sleep\n\n**Frightful Presence** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=68), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) 90 feet, DC 23<br /> **Tail Lash** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> **Trigger** A creature within reach of the dragon’s tail takes an action to Strike or attempt a skill check; **Efiect** The dragon Strikes with its tail at the triggering creature at a –2 penalty.
