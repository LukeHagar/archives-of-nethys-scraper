Beautiful, graceful, and truly gargantuan, the simurgh resembles nothing so much as a massive multicolored bird with the head of an equally enormous and regal lupine. Simurghs act as intermediaries in world-threatening conflicts, serving as agents of good deities or vigilantes who spread their own brand of justice, typically by obliterating or banishing evil extraplanar beings.\n\n Simurghs can live for thousands of years, and because these ancient beings are so rare many doubt their existence. But they are very real, as those who have been aided by a simurgh can enthusiastically attest. A simurgh does not show itself often, but when it does, it is typically in response to a truly grave threat, such as the incursion of an undead army or the rampage of some truly epic monster. Simurghs are nothing if not paragons of righteousness, and goodly heroes can hardly find a better ally in their quest to vanquish evil than a simurgh.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Beast](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2), [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 43\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 41\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 38\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Simurgh.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 18\">[Simurgh](/Monsters.aspx?ID=370)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Rare\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=137\" />\r\n<trait label=\"NG\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Gargantuan\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Beast\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=20\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 295</row>\n\n**Perception** +32; darkvision\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Celestial](/Languages.aspx?ID=16), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Draconic](/Languages.aspx?ID=2); [_tongues_](/Spells.aspx?ID=340)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +27, [Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2) +28, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +32, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +34, [Medicine](/Skills.aspx?ID=9) +35, [Performance](/Skills.aspx?ID=12) +28, [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13) +35, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +32\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +8\r\n\r\n**Dex** +3\r\n\r\n**Con** +6\r\n\r\n**Int** +3\r\n\r\n**Wis** +6\r\n\r\n**Cha** +5\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 41 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +30 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +29 \r\n\r\n**Will** +32 \r\n\r\n+1 status bonus to all saves vs. magic\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 350\n\n**Immunities**\r\ndisease, fire, negative energy, sleep\n\n**Aura of Peace** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61), [incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=93), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) 50 feet.
