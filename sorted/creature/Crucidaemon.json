The fiend’s shapely body, which appears to be sculpted from iron or mithril, belies a sinister wrath and love of inflicting pain. Crucidaemons particularly enjoy inflicting pain with their curved, serrated daggers, which are attached to their bodies via a chain that pierces each wrist.\n\n A crucidaemon’s existence is dedicated to subjecting its prey to an eternity of pain and terror. Unlike other daemons, many of which are eager to feed on mortal souls as soon as they can, the crucidaemon takes much greater pleasure in prolonging the agony of its victims. Oftentimes, a crucidaemon will inflict such torment and pain upon its prey that when the end finally comes, the victim tearfully thanks the daemon for the mercy of oblivion. An encounter with a crucidaemon that does not end with its death is far from over—crucidaemons have unequaled patience for those who dare oppose them.\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Fiend](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 34\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 32\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 29\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Daemon_Crucidaemon.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 15\">[Crucidaemon](/Monsters.aspx?ID=479)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Daemon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=213\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fiend\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=70\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #149: Against the Scarlet Triad](/Sources.aspx?ID=14) pg. 85</row>\n\n**Perception** +26; darkvision, [_detect alignment_](/Spells.aspx?ID=65) (good only), lifesense 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Abyssal](/Languages.aspx?ID=12), [Draconic](/Languages.aspx?ID=2), [Infernal](/Languages.aspx?ID=19); telepathy 100 feet\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +30, [Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2) +26, [Crafting](/Skills.aspx?ID=4) +30, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +26, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +28, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +30, [Thievery](/Skills.aspx?ID=17) +26\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +4\r\n\r\n**Dex** +7\r\n\r\n**Con** +7\r\n\r\n**Int** +3\r\n\r\n**Wis** +7\r\n\r\n**Cha** +5\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 38 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +26 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +30 \r\n\r\n**Will** +26 \r\n\r\n+1 status to all saves vs. magic\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 225\n\n**Immunities**\r\ndeath effects\r\n\r\n**Resistances**\r\nphysical 10 (except adamantine)\r\n\r\n**Weaknesses**\r\ngood 10\r\n\r\n**Trap Dodger** Crucidaemons are all but impossible to fool with traps.
