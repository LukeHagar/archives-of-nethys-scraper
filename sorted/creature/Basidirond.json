The large, bowl-shaped pod atop its body collects mineral-rich moisture—-whether runoff from cave walls or fresh blood—-for sustenance. It uses hallucinogenic spores to incapacitate prey long enough for it to beat its prey to a bloody pulp, then deposits the deliciously tenderized remains into this pod for consumption. A basidirond is over 6 feet tall and 3 to 4 feet wide, and weighs nearly 300 pounds when saturated.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Fungus](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 20\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 18\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 15\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Basidirond.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 5\">[Basidirond](/Monsters.aspx?ID=564)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fungus\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=77\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Mindless\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=108\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 34 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +8; [low-light vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=23), [tremorsense (imprecise) 30 feet](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=40)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\n\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +13, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +13\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +4\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** -5\r\n\r\n**Wis** +1\r\n\r\n**Cha** -3\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 22 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +13 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +11 \r\n\r\n**Will** +12 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 80\n\n**Immunities**\r\ncold, [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\nslashing 5\r\n\r\n**Cold Lethargy** Although a basidirond is immune to cold damage, any effect that deals cold damage causes it to become [slowed 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=35) for 1d4 rounds.
