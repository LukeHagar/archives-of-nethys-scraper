It primarily eats fruit and bugs, but can be incited to violence through fear or hunger. Giant bat attacks can quickly give rise to rumors of more dangerous monsters—many mistake these massive animals for some sort of demon or vampiric monster. But like other bats, giant bats are simply social and intelligent mammals. They are sometimes used as mounts by smaller humanoids, commonly those who hail from or dwell in mountainous or underground regions.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Animal](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 16\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 14\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 11\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 2\">[Giant Bat](/Monsters.aspx?ID=46)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Animal\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=9\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 39</row>\n\n**Perception** +11; echolocation (precise) 40 feet, low-light vision\r\n\r\n**Languages**\n\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +8, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +8, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +8\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +4\r\n\r\n**Dex** +2\r\n\r\n**Con** +3\r\n\r\n**Int** -4\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** -2\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Echolocation** A bat can use its hearing as a precise sense at the listed range.\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 18 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +9 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +8 \r\n\r\n**Will** +7 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 30\n\n**Wing Thrash** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> **Trigger** An adjacent enemy damages the giant bat. **Effect** The bat makes one or two wing Strikes—one against the triggering creature and one against another adjacent creature.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 15 feet, fly 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nfangs +10,\r\n**Damage** 1d10+4 slashing\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nwing +10 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170)),\r\n**Damage** 1d6+4 piercing\n\n</column>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"creature-family-12\" />",
