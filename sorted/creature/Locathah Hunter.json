The first hunters to strike are armed with barbed harpoons that deploy large fans of seaweed, slowing and exhausting their prey. A daring few locathahs use the embedded harpoon as a handle to ride prey for a short time. Once the creature is tired, remaining hunters finish it with longspears. Locathahs developed this hunting tradition to forge skilled warriors and deter potential attackers, partially in response to centuries of oppression and mistreatment from other aquatic cultures.\n\n Locathahs rarely hunt land-dwellers, instead offering to trade their services as guides in exchange for metal and ceramic items they can't build underwater—and for tubers, which they consider earthy delicacies. They render aid to damaged sailing ships and rescue shipwrecked sailors, providing food and guidance.\n\n Locathah communities—usually villages of 200 individuals or fewer—are matriarchal. The ruler is also as its primary egg-layer, providing each generation with powerful familial bonds. The communities are tight-knit and loyal. Matriarchs are advised and assisted by primal spellcasters and healers, who are often accompanied by octopus companions.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 18\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 16\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 13\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Locathah.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 3\">[Locathah Hunter](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1223)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Amphibious\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=207\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Locathah\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=356\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 3](/Sources.aspx?ID=66) pg. 164</row>\n\n**Perception** +9; [low-light vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=23)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Aquan](/Languages.aspx?ID=14), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +11, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +5, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +7, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +8, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +7\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +4\r\n\r\n**Dex** +3\r\n\r\n**Con** +0\r\n\r\n**Int** +1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +2\r\n\r\n**Cha** +0\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n[Crossbow](/Weapons.aspx?ID=67) (12 fan bolts), [Longspear](/Weapons.aspx?ID=6), [Scale Mail](/Armor.aspx?ID=8)\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 20 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +7 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +10 \r\n\r\n**Will** +9 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 38\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 10 feet, swim 40 feet; smooth swimmer\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nlongspear +11 ([reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 1d8+4 piercing\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\ncrossbow +10 ([range increment 120 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=248), [reload 1](/Traits.aspx?ID=254)),\r\n**Damage** 1d8 piercing plus fan bolt\n\n**Cooperative Hunting**   After the hunter attempts a Strike at a Large or larger target (regardless of success or failure), the next Strike one of the hunter's allies makes against the same target gains a +2 circumstance bonus to the attack roll.\r\n\r\n**Fan Bolt**   The hunter prepares their hooked crossbow bolts with carefully woven seaweed.
