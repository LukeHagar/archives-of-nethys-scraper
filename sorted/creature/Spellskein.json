Usually when a ritual is cast, the outcome is reliable and predictable, but sometimes magic takes unexpected turns and a spell's energy lands in unintended places.\n\n Spellskeins are scraps of fabric and paper infused with magic and brought to life. Once animated, they fold themselves into different shapes, changing both their appearance and their abilities based on their configuration. Spellskeins are only rarely aggressive and sometimes downright timid, but most have a playful streak.\n\n Though they are often made accidentally out of magical leakage from rituals, some ritualists intentionally create spellskeins to serve as magical toys or animated decor. These planned spellskeins tend to be more obedient and less mischievous than their accidental counterparts, following commands or routines set by their creators even after said creators are long gone.\n\n Scrap pieces torn from the body of a spellskein sometimes animate as ever smaller, more mischievous constructs, which usually dart away to hide until it's safe to come out and cause trouble.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Construct](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2), [Crafting](/Skills.aspx?ID=4)): DC 16\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 14\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 11\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Spellskein.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 0\">[Spellskein](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1616)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Tiny\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Construct\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=35\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #169: Kindled Magic](/Sources.aspx?ID=94) pg. 85</row>\n\n**Perception** +2; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1); (can't speak any language)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +5, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +7\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** -1\r\n\r\n**Dex** +3\r\n\r\n**Con** +1\r\n\r\n**Int** -4\r\n\r\n**Wis** +0\r\n\r\n**Cha** -5\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 16 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +5 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +9 \r\n\r\n**Will** +4 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 15\n\n**Immunities**\r\nbleed, [death](/Traits.aspx?ID=40) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), [doomed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=9), [drained](/Conditions.aspx?ID=10), [fatigued](/Conditions.aspx?ID=15), [healing](/Traits.aspx?ID=89), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117), [nonlethal](/Traits.aspx?ID=188) attacks, [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126), [sickened](/Conditions.aspx?ID=34), [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38)\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 25 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nsharp edge +7 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179)),\r\n**Damage** 1d6+1 slashing\n\n**Collapse**   The spellskein can collapse flat to the ground to [Hide](/Actions.aspx?ID=62); it can attempt to Hide even if it doesn't have any cover or concealment.\r\n\r\n**Crane Glide** <actions string=\"Single Action\" />  **Requirements** The spellskein is folded into its crane shape; **Effect** The spellskein gains a 25-foot fly Speed until the beginning of its next turn.\r\n\r\n**Frog Hop** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" />  **Requirements** The spellskein is folded into its frog shape; **Effect** The spellskein [Leaps](/Actions.aspx?ID=81) 15 feet horizontally or vertically and gains a 10-foot climb Speed until the beginning of its next turn.\r\n\r\n**Lizard Frill** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([Arcane](/Traits.aspx?ID=11), [Enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61), [Fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=68), [Mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) **Requirements** The spellskein is folded into its lizard shape; **Effect** The spellskein puffs out its cloth frills and shakes them from side to side to look fierce.
