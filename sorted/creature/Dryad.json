They prefer using indirect methods to dissuade those who would harm their sacred groves and beloved forests, but they are not above using enchantments to enlist the aid of allies when evil threats cannot be dissuaded with words alone. In times of peace, dryads happily live secluded lives inside their trees, and a community at harmony with nature might not even realize a dryad lives nearby.\n\n Though they watch over all the woods around them, dryads are inextricably tied to a specific tree, usually an oak. Dryads who are bonded to another type of tree are fundamentally the same, but they may differ in temperament and appearance to match their ward. For instance, kraneiai, or cherry-tree dryads, have beautiful pink coloration and concern themselves with the fragile beauty of life.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Fey](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 18\r\n\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Plant](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 18\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 16\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 13\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Nymph_Dryad.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 3\">[Dryad](/Monsters.aspx?ID=312)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"CG\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fey\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=69\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Nymph\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=230\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Plant\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=125\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 246</row>\n\n**Perception** +10; low-light vision\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Elven](/Languages.aspx?ID=4), [Sylvan](/Languages.aspx?ID=10); [_speak with plants_](/Spells.aspx?ID=294)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +9, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +5, [Crafting](/Skills.aspx?ID=4) +7, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +9, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +13, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +9, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +12\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +0\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +1\r\n\r\n**Int** +2\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** +4\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Nature Empathy** The dryad can use Diplomacy to Make an Impression on and make very simple Requests of animals and plants.\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 19 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +6 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +11 \r\n\r\n**Will** +10 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 55\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\ncold iron 5, fire 5\r\n\r\n**Tree Dependent** A dryad is mystically bonded to a single great tree and must remain within 300 feet of it.
