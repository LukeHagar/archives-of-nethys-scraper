A linnorm egg remains viable for many years, protected by a tough, leathery skin easily mistaken for stone. When a male linnorm eventually stumbles across the egg, he fertilizes it and takes it to a secure and remote location, leaving it alone to eventually hatch. Newborn linnorms remain hidden in their nests for several months as they mature, growing large enough to hunt on their own and setting out into the world. These linnorms are roughly the equivalent of older teenagers when compared to other species. Younger linnorms, while still primal creatures with a strong tie to the [First World](/Planes.aspx?ID=10), haven't yet manifested most of their magical powers. They still can't breathe deadly fire or lightning or see invisible creatures, and, most importantly, they can be slain without prompting the linnorm's legendary death curse. They do, however, have voracious appetites, consuming any living thing to fuel their rapid growth. A linnorm is most vulnerable during this time; scouts who find tracks of a young linnorm quickly muster a hunting party of stalwart and experienced warriors to track the creature down and kill it quickly—before they draw the attention of the linnorm's father.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Dragon](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2)): DC 25\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 23\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 20\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 7\">[Young Linnorm](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1726)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"CE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Dragon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=50\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Monsters of Myth](/Sources.aspx?ID=107) pg. 29</row>\n\n**Perception** +15; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), [low-light vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=23), [scent](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=33) (imprecise) 60 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Aklo](/Languages.aspx?ID=13), [Draconic](/Languages.aspx?ID=2), [Sylvan](/Languages.aspx?ID=10); (can't speak any language)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +15, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +17\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +6\r\n\r\n**Dex** +3\r\n\r\n**Con** +5\r\n\r\n**Int** -4\r\n\r\n**Wis** +4\r\n\r\n**Cha** +5\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 25 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +18 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +15 \r\n\r\n**Will** +12 \r\n\r\n+1 status to all saves vs. magic\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 115\r\n\r\n, regeneration [](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=26) 5 (deactivated by [cold iron](/Equipment.aspx?ID=374))\r\n\r\n**Immunities**\r\n[curse](/Traits.aspx?ID=38), paralyzed, [sleep](/Traits.aspx?ID=145)\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\n[cold iron](/Equipment.aspx?ID=374) 5\r\n\r\n**[Attack of Opportunity](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=3)** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> Tail only.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 30 feet, fly 60 feet, swim 45 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njaws +18 ([Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 2d10+9 piercing plus young linnorm venom\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nclaw +18 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 2d8+9 slashing\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\ntail +18 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [reach 15 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 2d8+9 bludgeoning plus [Improved Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=27)\n\n**[Constrict](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=10)** <actions string=\"Single Action\" />  2d8+4 bludgeoning, DC 25\r\n\r\n**Young Linnorm Venom**  ([Poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126)) **Saving Throw** DC 25 Fortitude; **Maximum Duration** 10 rounds; **Stage 1** 4d6 poison damage and [drained 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=10)\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Varieties of Young Linnorms</title>\r\n\r\nWhile the statistics for young linnorms suit most uses, you might choose to customize a creature by giving it abilities and traits found in its adult variety. \n<ul><li>**[Cairn Linnorm](/Monsters.aspx?ID=722)**: Immune to [acid](/Traits.aspx?ID=3); venom inflicts acid damage instead of poison damage; gains a climb speed of 30 feet; loses [Constrict](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=10).</li><li>**[Crag Linnorm](/Monsters.aspx?ID=284)**: Immune to [fire](/Traits.aspx?ID=72); venom inflicts fire damage instead of poison damage.</li><li>**[Fjord Linnorm](/Monsters.aspx?ID=721)**: Immune to [cold](/Traits.aspx?ID=27); venom inflicts cold damage instead of poison damage and [clumsy](/Conditions.aspx?ID=3) instead of drained.</li><li>**[Ice Linnorm](/Monsters.aspx?ID=285)**: Immune to cold; venom inflicts cold damage instead of poison damage.</li><li>**[Shoal Linnorm](/Monsters.aspx?ID=720)**: Immune to fire; venom inflicts fire damage instead of poison damage.</li><li>**[Taiga Linnorm](/Monsters.aspx?ID=723)**: Immune to [electricity](/Traits.aspx?ID=56); venom inflicts electricity damage instead of poison damage; gains Spines; loses Constrict.</li><li>**[Tarn Linnorm](/Monsters.aspx?ID=286)**: Immune to acid; venom inflicts acid damage instead of poison damage; gains Double Bite.</li><li>**[Tor Linnorm](/Monsters.aspx?ID=287)**: Immune to fire; venom inflicts fire damage instead of poison damage; gains a climb speed of 30 feet.</li></ul> Despite their sizable threat, presenting the head of one of these linnorm youths is more likely to see a warrior laughed out of town than crowned king.
