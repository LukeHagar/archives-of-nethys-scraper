The creature manifests as an enormous, disembodied head, 10 feet in height and covered in coarse black hair, with bat-like wings and vicious fangs and talons. Daqqanoenyents are naturally conflicted creatures. As the product of the tortured wills of numerous victims, daqqanoenyents sometimes exhibit strange or contradictory behavior as various individual wills struggle for control. Their conflicting desires make daqqanoenyents relatively easy to trick or deceive, and the creatures are vulnerable to fire. One story of a daqqanoenyent encounter describes the creature attempting to eat an old woman, only to be tricked by the woman into devouring a live coal. Their mouth aflame, the daqqanoenyent fled into the wilderness, never to be seen again.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Undead](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 31\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 29\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 26\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Daqqanoenyent.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 9\">[Daqqanoenyent](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1841)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Rare\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=137\" />\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Undead\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=160\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Book of the Dead](/Sources.aspx?ID=118) pg. 75</row>\n\n**Perception** +17; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Necril](/Languages.aspx?ID=20); plus any one language spoken in life (can't speak any language)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +17, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +21, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +17\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +6\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** +0\r\n\r\n**Wis** +2\r\n\r\n**Cha** +0\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 28 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +21 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +17 \r\n\r\n**Will** +15 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 170\r\n([negative healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=42))\n\n**Immunities**\r\n[death](/Traits.aspx?ID=40) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126), [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38)\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\n[fire](/Traits.aspx?ID=72) 10, [positive](/Traits.aspx?ID=128) 5\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 15 feet, fly 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njaws +21,\r\n**Damage** 2d12+9 piercing plus 1d4 negative and [Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=18)\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\ntalon +21 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170)),\r\n**Damage** 2d8+9 slashing plus 1d4 negative and [Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=18)\n\n**Baleful Gaze** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([Curse](/Traits.aspx?ID=38), [Emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [Fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=68), [Mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [Visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=163)) The daqqanoenyent's face twists into an expression of unbridled rage.
