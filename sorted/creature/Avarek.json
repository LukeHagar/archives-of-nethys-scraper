Bipedal, aquatic fey covered in long, urchin-like spines, avareks stand 2 feet tall—or 3 feet tall if measured to the tips of their spines—and weigh fewer than 30 pounds.\n\n Avareks rely on subtlety and subterfuge to indulge their destructive whims, using magic to sabotage ships and cloud the minds of crew members and passengers. Patient and cunning, avareks lurk beneath or within a targeted vessel for weeks, building conflict and mistrust. Soon, shipmates accuse one another of theft and treachery; superstitious crew members might believe their ship is haunted. Eventually, the crew becomes too frightened or mistrustful to save their ship from the avareks' sabotage.\n\n Avareks take pride in their sunken trophies, claiming the wrecks of ships they've destroyed as their homes and gorging on the bloated, water-logged corpses of the crew and passengers.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Fey](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 26\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 24\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 21\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Avarek.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 8\">[Avarek](/Monsters.aspx?ID=998)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Small\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Amphibious\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=207\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fey\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=69\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #159: All or Nothing](/Sources.aspx?ID=48) pg. 80</row>\n\n**Perception** +16; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Aquan](/Languages.aspx?ID=14), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Undercommon](/Languages.aspx?ID=11); [_speak with animals_](/Spells.aspx?ID=293)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +17, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +14, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +17, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +16, [Sailing Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +15, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +19, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +16, [Thievery](/Skills.aspx?ID=17) +19\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +2\r\n\r\n**Dex** +5\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** +3\r\n\r\n**Wis** +4\r\n\r\n**Cha** +3\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n_+1 [striking](/Equipment.aspx?ID=280) [dagger](/Weapons.aspx?ID=3)_\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 26 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +16 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +19 \r\n\r\n**Will** +16 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 150\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\ncold iron 8\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 20 feet, climb 20 feet, swim 50 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\n_dagger_ +20 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179), [Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [versatile S](/Traits.aspx?ID=200)),\r\n**Damage** 2d4+4 piercing\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nspine +16,\r\n**Damage** 2d6+4 piercing plus 1d6 [persistent bleed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=29)\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\n_dagger_ +20 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179), [Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [thrown 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=195), [versatile S](/Traits.aspx?ID=200)),\r\n**Damage** 2d4+4 piercing\r\n\r\n**Primal Innate Spells** DC 30, attack +22\r\n- **Cantrips (4th)**\r\n[Prestidigitation](/Spells.aspx?ID=229)\r\n- **1st**\r\n[Grease](/Spells.aspx?ID=140) (at will), [Gust of Wind](/Spells.aspx?ID=143) (at will)\r\n- **2nd**\r\n[Hydraulic Push](/Spells.aspx?ID=154) (at will), [Invisibility](/Spells.aspx?ID=164) (self only), [Shatter](/Spells.aspx?ID=279), [Ventriloquism](/Spells.aspx?ID=356) (at will)\r\n- **4th**\r\n[Confusion](/Spells.aspx?ID=48), [Hydraulic Torrent](/Spells.aspx?ID=155), [Suggestion](/Spells.aspx?ID=315)\r\n- **Constant (4th)**\r\n[Speak with Animals](/Spells.aspx?ID=293)\r\n\r\n**Prickly Defense** <actions string=\"Single Action\" />  The avarek withdraws beneath its spines, presenting a defensive, spiky exterior.
