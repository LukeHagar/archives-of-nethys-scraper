Land-bound, they scamper across the badlands on four short limbs, their speckled brown and yellow bodies blending into the terrain.\n\n Though najra lizards live and sleep alone or in mated pairs near their hunting grounds, groups of up to two dozen work in unison to hunt. The lowest-ranked members of a najra lizard swarm leave their hidden dens to target prey with their parching spit. Once the unquenchable thirst caused by their venom drives the creature to the nearby watering hole, the entire swarm attacks. Even when unable to overwhelm foes with sheer numbers, najra lizards have little interest in fighting fairly. They often use their tails to rustle nearby desert scrub, hurl small stones, or otherwise divert attention so they can sneak away or attack from hiding.\n\n Najra lizards dislike humanoids and humanoid civilization, and they are particularly rankled by being called mere “lizards.” They refer to themselves by a [Draconic](/Languages.aspx?ID=2) word that translates roughly to “swarm dragon.” Like almost all dragons, najra lizards covet shiny metals and glittering gems. They typically hide accumulated treasures in small holes near where they sleep, and arguments over such caches are one of the few things that engender violence among members of the same pack.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Dragon](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2)): DC 21\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 19\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 16\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/NajraLizard.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 4\">[Najra Lizard](/Monsters.aspx?ID=993)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"CN\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Tiny\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Dragon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=50\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #158: Sixty Feet Under](/Sources.aspx?ID=47) pg. 83</row>\n\n**Perception** +11; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), [scent](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=33) (imprecise) 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Draconic](/Languages.aspx?ID=2)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +14, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +10, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +12, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +12\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** -1\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +2\r\n\r\n**Int** -1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** +2\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 21 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +10 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +12 \r\n\r\n**Will** +11 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 60\n\n**Immunities**\r\n[paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [sleep](/Traits.aspx?ID=145)\n\n**Shared Diversion** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> **Trigger** Another creature in the najra lizard's square succeeds at a [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) check to [Create a Diversion](/Actions.aspx?ID=45); **Effect** The najra lizard automatically successfully Creates a Diversion against the same targets.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njaws +14,\r\n**Damage** 2d6 piercing plus najra lizard venom\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nvenomous spit +14 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126), [range increment 20 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=248)),\r\n**Damage** 1d4 poison plus najra lizard venom\n\n**Najra Lizard Venom**   The creature is extremely thirsty and can't quench its thirst while poisoned; **Saving Throw** DC 21 Fortitude; **Maximum Duration** 4 hours; **Stage 1** 1d4 poison damage, [fatigued](/Conditions.aspx?ID=15), and 1d4 damage that can't be recovered until the creature quenches its thirst (1 round); **Stage 2** as stage 1 (1 hour)\r\n\r\n**Najra Swarm Attack**   The najra lizard's melee Strikes deal 1d6 precision damage to creatures sharing a square with more than one najra lizard.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_5_TreasureAndRewards.png\">Najra Lizard Venom</title>\r\n\r\nThough difficult to obtain, najra lizard venom has several uses across Vudran society.
