As much as 15 feet long and weighing up to 1,000 pounds, a wyvern’s resilient body allows it to crash talons-first into large prey without serious risk to itself. A wyvern uses its momentum to stun its target before injecting it with searing venom or carrying it over the side of a nearby cliff. Because a wyvern lacks the strength to haul its prey all the way to its nest intact, it is far more likely to lift and drop its victim over a gully or canyon and let gravity do its work before it descends to pick apart the carcass.\n\n Conversation is of little interest to a wyvern, as the creature typically speaks only to taunt its prey, issue territorial claims, or demand tribute. Even so, many wyverns enjoy grim humor and tales of violent acts, particularly if those acts were committed by the storyteller. A wyvern properly appeased with meat, entertainment, and treasure sometimes agrees to provide assistance ranging from giving directions to serving as a mount for a powerful humanoid. However, these arrangements rarely last more than a few weeks before the wyvern’s pride, malice, or insolence inspires it to flee or even betray its allies. Only the truly cruel can cow a wyvern into servitude for an extended period, as most wyverns are so self-interested that they go out of their way to avoid helping others.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Dragon](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2)): DC 22\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 20\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 17\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Drake_Wyvern.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 6\">[Wyvern](/Monsters.aspx?ID=162)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Dragon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=50\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 133</row>\n\n**Perception** +13; darkvision, scent (imprecise) 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Draconic](/Languages.aspx?ID=2)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +14, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +15, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +12\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +5\r\n\r\n**Dex** +2\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** -2\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** +0\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 24 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +16 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +12 \r\n\r\n**Will** +13 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 95\n\n**Immunities**\r\nparalyzed, unconscious\n\n**Attack of Opportunity** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /><br /> **Savage** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> **Trigger** A creature grabbed by the wyvern critically fails a skill check to Escape. **Effect** The wyvern makes a stinger Strike against the triggering creature.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 20 feet, fly 60 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nfangs +17,\r\n**Damage** 2d12+5 piercing\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nclaw +17,\r\n**Damage** 2d8+5 slashing plus Grab\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nstinger +15 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 2d6+5 piercing plus wyvern venom\n\n**Powerful Dive** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([Move](/Traits.aspx?ID=114)) The wyvern Flies up to its fly Speed and must both move forward at least 20 feet and descend at least 10 feet.
