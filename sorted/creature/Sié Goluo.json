Most believe he first appeared during the Age of Darkness to protect the Mwangi people from the worst dangers of the everlasting night. Bekyar storytellers claim he is older still, from a time before the first people walked Golarion. This immortal spirit has incarnated into multiple forms over millennia. In the oldest surviving tales, they say Sié Goluo looked like an ordinary—if oversized—ox, save for his nearly human-looking eyes. Most recently, people say he has the appearance of several different animals, but accounts vary on which animals make up his form.\n\n When a traveling farmer is assailed by a deadly beast, or a small village faces the wrath of an advancing army, Sié Goluo manifests in whatever form will allow him to best defend them. There seem to be no geographical limitations on where he can manifest, as there are tales of him saving Mwangi adventurers as far spread as Tian Xia and Arcadia.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Beast](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2), [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 42\r\n\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Spirit](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11)): DC 42\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 40\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 37\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/SieGolou.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 14\">[Sié Goluo](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1441)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Unique\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=161\" />\r\n<trait label=\"NG\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Huge\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Beast\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=20\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Incorporeal\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=222\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Spirit\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=149\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [The Mwangi Expanse](/Sources.aspx?ID=89) pg. 305 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +25; imprecise [scent](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=33) 60 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Mwangi](/Languages.aspx?ID=39); (can't speak any language)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +31, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +28, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +31, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +31, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +28\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +9\r\n\r\n**Dex** +5\r\n\r\n**Con** +8\r\n\r\n**Int** +1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +8\r\n\r\n**Cha** +4\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 36 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +28 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +20 \r\n\r\n**Will** +28 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 320\r\n(rejuvenation)\n\n**Immunities**\r\n[death](/Traits.aspx?ID=40) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126), precision, [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38)\r\n\r\n**Resistances**\r\nall damage 10 (except [force](/Traits.aspx?ID=75), [_ghost touch_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=297), or [negative](/Traits.aspx?ID=118); double resistane against non-[magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103))\n\n**Rejuvenation** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) When Sié Goluo is destroyed, he reforms, fully healed, at a location of his choosing anywhere on the [Material Plane](/Planes.aspx?ID=1) after 2d4 days.
