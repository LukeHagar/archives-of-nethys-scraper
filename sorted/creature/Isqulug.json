The creature resembles a bipedal amphibian with tentacles instead of arms and a head composed of an undulant mass of what appear to be shifting, slimy transparent eggs filled with writhing larvae. In truth, these larvae constitute the mind and consciousness of the isqulug—its “body” is little more than an organic suit manufactured from the flesh of those it has consumed, analogous to the complex web of a spider or the hive of a colony of bees, but fully capable of movement and violence.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Aberration](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11)): DC 30\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 28\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 25\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Isqulug.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 11\">[Isqulug](/Monsters.aspx?ID=705)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Aberration\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=1\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Amphibious\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=207\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 149 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +24; [greater darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), host scent 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Aklo](/Languages.aspx?ID=13)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +22, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +24, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +22, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +22\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +7\r\n\r\n**Dex** +5\r\n\r\n**Con** +7\r\n\r\n**Int** +3\r\n\r\n**Wis** +7\r\n\r\n**Cha** +5\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Host Scent** An isqulug can precisely sense any creature infected with isqulugia within 30 feet, and knows the current stage of the disease.\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 31 [all-around vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=1)\r\n\r\n**Fort** +24 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +20 \r\n\r\n**Will** +18 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 230\r\n\r\n, regeneration 10 (deactivated by cold)\r\n\r\n**Immunities**\r\n[swarm mind](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=36)\r\n\r\n**Resistances**\r\nfire 10\r\n\r\n**Weaknesses**\r\ncold 10\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 25 feet, swim 25 feet; swamp stride\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\ntentacle +22 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 2d12+11 bludgeoning plus isqulugia\r\n\r\n**Primal Innate Spells** DC 30, attack +22\r\n- **Cantrips (5th)**\r\n[Dancing Lights](/Spells.aspx?ID=58)\r\n- **Cantrips (1st)**\r\n[Pass Without Trace](/Spells.aspx?ID=215)\r\n- **4th**\r\n[Fly](/Spells.aspx?ID=125)\r\n- **5th**\r\n[Control Water](/Spells.aspx?ID=51), [Entangle](/Spells.aspx?ID=103) (at will), [Hallucinatory Terrain](/Spells.aspx?ID=145), [Obscuring Mist](/Spells.aspx?ID=210) (at will)\r\n- **6th**\r\n[Tangling Creepers](/Spells.aspx?ID=331)\r\n\r\n**Expel Infestation** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" />  The isqulug expels larvae from the hivemind in its head in a 30-foot cone.
