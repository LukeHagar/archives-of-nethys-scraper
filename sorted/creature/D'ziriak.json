Averaging 7 feet in height, D'ziriaks have four arms, two legs, and a termite-like abdomen. The larger pair of arms, used for most tasks, have five-fingered hands with sharp, insectile claws. The smaller pair of arms are reserved for fine manipulations and are not effective in combat.\n\nD'ziriaks' otherwise dull brown carapaces are decorated with numerous runes glowing in bright colors. These tattoo-like runes indicate an individual's role in D'ziriak society, and set them apart from their home plane's other native inhabitants. The runes glow with natural bioluminescence, and D'ziriaks can make them flare brightly for an instant, at the expense of overstressing the biochemical glands that create and maintain the runes for an extended time. The color and shape of the runes are partially natural, but can be shaped and customized carefully over time to fit the individual's station.\n\nThe D'ziriak language is a mix of buzzes and chitters, and is spoken by few other creatures. D'ziriaks prefer to communicate with other species using telepathy rather than endure the sound of their language being \"butchered by fleshy throats.\" D'ziriaks organize into hive cities led by a king and queen. These hive cities consist of impressive spires, yet these towers are only the foremost part of the settlement, with many more chambers reaching deep below for residences, workshops, and fungus farms. D'ziriak settlements are lit inside and out with alchemical and magical light sources, often in the shapes of runes. These dimly glowing towers provide travelers with landmarks, and perhaps promise safe havens, on the otherwise gloomy Shadow Plane.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Aberration](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11)): DC 18\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 16\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 13\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Dziriak.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 3\">[D'ziriak](/Monsters.aspx?ID=644)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Aberration\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=1\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Shadow\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=143\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 104 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +10; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[D'ziriak](/Languages.aspx?ID=58), [Shadowtongue](/Languages.aspx?ID=21); [telepathy 100 feet](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=37)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2) +8, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +6, [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11) +10, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +10, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +8\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +1\r\n\r\n**Dex** +3\r\n\r\n**Con** +1\r\n\r\n**Int** +1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** +4\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 19 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +6 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +12 \r\n\r\n**Will** +10 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 45\n\n**Glow** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [light](/Traits.aspx?ID=100)) 20 feet.
