As guardians of their mountain homes, giant eagles attempt to prevent the encroachment of civilization upon wild land and the predations of wicked humanoid settlements. Unlike ordinary eagles, which tend to be solitary creatures, giant eagles congregate within aeries holding up to a dozen members and work together to protect their domains.\n\n Giant eagles have wingspans up to 30 feet across and weigh up to 500 pounds. These impressive birds cannot be easily broken or cowed. A giant eagle may allow trusted terrestrial friends to ride it, but they invariably resist saddles, harnesses, or other equipment that might suggest they are mere beasts of burden rather than trusted companions. Giant eagles are long-lived and take debts and oaths very seriously, often remembering slights for years and remaining slow to forgive.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Beast](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2), [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 18\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 16\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 13\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Eagle_GiantEagle.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 3\">[Giant Eagle](/Monsters.aspx?ID=173)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"NG\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Beast\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=20\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 141</row>\n\n**Perception** +11; low-light vision\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Auran](/Languages.aspx?ID=15), [Sylvan](/Languages.aspx?ID=10); (can’t speak any language)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +11, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +8\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +3\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +1\r\n\r\n**Int** +0\r\n\r\n**Wis** +2\r\n\r\n**Cha** +2\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 19 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +6 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +11 \r\n\r\n**Will** +9 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 45\n\n**Evasion** When a giant eagle rolls a success on a Reflex save, it gets a critical success instead.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 10 feet, fly 60 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nbeak +12,\r\n**Damage** 2d8+5 piercing\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\ntalon +12 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170)),\r\n**Damage** 1d10+5 slashing plus Grab\n\n**Eagle Dive** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" />  The giant eagle Flies up to double its fly Speed in a straight line, descending at least 10 feet, and then makes a talon Strike.\r\n\r\n**Snatch**   A giant eagle can Fly at half Speed while it has a creature grabbed or restrained in its talons, carrying that creature along with it.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Allies in the Skies</title>\r\n\r\nAeries of giant eagles can make potent allies to those who respect their territories and approach without malice in their hearts.
