This animated object's level can be no higher than the dybbuk's level – 2. This possession ends when the object is destroyed or the dybbuk leaves it by using this ability again.

If the dybbuk took control of the target with Malevolent Possession, when the dybbuk departs, the target has only incoherent memories of the interval it was possessed. If a creature dies while possessed by the dybbuk and its corpse remains intact, the dybbuk can immediately inhabit the corpse (see Inhabit Object) as a reaction, in which case the corpse becomes an animated object.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Cruel Puppet Masters</title>\r\n\r\nDybbuks revel in tricking mortals and using their telekinetic abilities to sow fear in the hearts of those around them.
