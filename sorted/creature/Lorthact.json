But Lorthact was not satisfied in his station—like so many devils— and concocted a plan to reverse roles with [Eiseth](/Deities.aspx?ID=169), one of Hell's Queens of the Night. Lorthact hoped to gain control of the [erinyes](/Monsters.aspx?ID=111) armies of Hell and a substantial portion of Dis, while Eiseth would take the role of his consort. \n\nEiseth uncovered the plot, and Lorthact found himself the target of her legendary fury. His allies and patrons abandoned him, unwilling to bring Eiseth's wrath upon themselves, and Lorthact fled Hell entirely. He leapt from plane to plane, unable to find refuge until at last he slipped Eiseth's pursuit by hiding as a mortal in the city of Korvosa.\n\n Korvosa proved a fruitful haven and hideout for Lorthact. He quickly found a mortal powerful enough to further his ambition but foolish enough to bargain with him: Volshyenek Ornelos. It wasn't long before Lorthact replaced the man, and for over a century, Lorthact led the Acadamae directly. When Volshyenek's identity drew too much attention from Eiseth's minions, he faked “Ornelos's” death and continued to direct the wizards' college from the shadows until today. He collected souls over the years—primarily through an elaborate hoax known as the Breaching Festival—hoping to eventually rebuild his name and reputation in Hell's hierarchy, but patience was never one of Lorthact's virtues.\n\n His attempts to quicken the process have backfired twice in recent years, both as the direct result of adventurers accidentally interfering with his plots. In the years since these risky failures, Lorthact sacrificed much of his infernal power to maintain his metaphysical secrecy from Eiseth. Now but a shadow of his former power (already much reduced from his original strength as an Infernal Duke), Lorthact is risking everything in a final attempt to regain an edge by supporting the [vampire, strigoi](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=314) progenitor Aliriel, planning to betray her and claim complete control over Ileosa's soul once she returns to life.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Fiend](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 45\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 43\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 40\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 16\">[Lorthact](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1945)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Unique\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=161\" />\r\n<trait label=\"LE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Devil\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=44\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fiend\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=70\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Shadows at Sundown](/Sources.aspx?ID=121) pg. 62</row>\n\n**Perception** +27; [greater darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Abyssal](/Languages.aspx?ID=12), [Aklo](/Languages.aspx?ID=13), [Azlanti](/Languages.aspx?ID=49), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Draconic](/Languages.aspx?ID=2), [Dwarven](/Languages.aspx?ID=3), [Elven](/Languages.aspx?ID=4), [Ignan](/Languages.aspx?ID=18), [Infernal](/Languages.aspx?ID=19), [Jotun](/Languages.aspx?ID=8), [Shoanti](/Languages.aspx?ID=41), [Thassilonian](/Languages.aspx?ID=52), [Undercommon](/Languages.aspx?ID=11), [Varisian](/Languages.aspx?ID=44); [telepathy](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=37) 300 feet, [_tongues_](/Spells.aspx?ID=340)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Academia Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +32, [Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +28, [Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2) +30, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +33, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +31, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +31, [Legal Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +30, [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11) +30, [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13) +27, [Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14) +30, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +32\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +6\r\n\r\n**Dex** +6\r\n\r\n**Con** +6\r\n\r\n**Int** +6\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** +9\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n[Staff of Power](/Equipment.aspx?ID=361)\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 38 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +28 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +30 \r\n\r\n**Will** +25 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 300\n\n**Immunities**\r\n[divination](/Traits.aspx?ID=47), [fire](/Traits.aspx?ID=72)\r\n\r\n**Resistances**\r\n[mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106) 15, physical 15 (except [silver](/Equipment.aspx?ID=379))\r\n\r\n**Weaknesses**\r\ngood 15\r\n\r\n**Divination Immunity** As a side effect of existing slightly outside the normal time stream, Lorthact is difficult to detect via [divination](/Traits.aspx?ID=47) spells and abilities.

He can recharge his staff of power as a prepared spellcaster by using his arcane spell slots. He has one spell slot to prepare arcane spells of each level from 1st to 8th, and can prepare any Common arcane spell in these slots during his daily preparations.

In Volshyenek's form, he loses his fly Speed and claw Strikes, doesn't inflict additional mental damage with his Strikes, and reduces his AC to 34. He gains a +4 status bonus on [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) checks to appear human in this guise.\r\n\r\n**Staff of Power**   Lorthact's [_staff of power_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=361) is tipped with a pair of metal tines that grant the weapon the [versatile piercing](/Traits.aspx?ID=200) trait.\r\n\r\n**Thought Theft**  ([Curse](/Traits.aspx?ID=38), [Divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [Enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61), [Mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) Any creature that takes mental damage from Lorthact's claws or staff must succeed at a DC 37 Will save or become [stupefied 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=37) (stupefied 2 on a critical failure). Further mental damage dealt by Lorthact increases the value of the stupefied condition by 1 on a failed save to a maximum of stupefied 4. Whenever Lorthact causes a creature to become stupefied in this way, he absorbs some of those thoughts and gains a +1 status bonus on all Will saving throws and Intelligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based skill checks until the end of his next turn.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Lorthact's Cult</title>\r\n\r\nLorthact's cult is incredibly small.

Staff of Power Lorthact's staff of power is tipped with a pair of metal tines that grant the weapon the versatile piercing trait. Thought Theft (Curse, Divine, Enchantment, Mental) Any creature that takes mental damage from Lorthact's claws or staff must succeed at a DC 37 Will save or become stupefied 1 (stupefied 2 on a critical failure). Further mental damage dealt by Lorthact increases the value of the stupefied condition by 1 on a failed save to a maximum of stupefied 4. Whenever Lorthact causes a creature to become stupefied in this way, he absorbs some of those thoughts and gains a +1 status bonus on all Will saving throws and Intelligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based skill checks until the end of his next turn. Lorthact's Cult Lorthact's cult is incredibly small. Even in his reduced state, he can still grant spells to his few remaining clerics (none of whom appear in this adventure). His symbol is a staff wrapped in scrolls.
