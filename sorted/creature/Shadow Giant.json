Their cultures vary greatly depending on whether the giants reside in their land of origin or have relocated to the Material Plane. On the Shadow Plane, they live in familiar groups and uphold a nomadic way of life as they roam across ancestral lands between shadowy forests and misty chasms. These hunter-gatherers pass down lore through oral histories, conduct pilgrimages to unholy ziggurats of black stone, and bathe in the blood of their long-standing foes, including rival shadow giant clans and velstracs intent on enslaving their kind. On the Material Plane, conversely, they are secretive and isolationist, keeping apart from other peoples in forbidding structures of black stone in high, isolated mountain valleys.\n\n Standing 15 feet tall, with gray skin and hair only a shade lighter, shadow giants are fearsome foes with a well-earned reputation as zealous warmongers and ruthless combatants. They rarely interact with outsiders, though they may treat with proven warriors who show the giants the respect and deference they feel they deserve. Only a small subset of shadow giants worship [Zon-Kuthon](/Deities.aspx?ID=20), and most of these Kuthites are so firmly entrenched in the culture of Nidal that their Shadow Plane-dwelling kin would hardly recognize them. Most shadow giants instead practice an ancient religion, unique to their people, with its own bloody themes of sacrifice and self-mutilation.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 31\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 29\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 26\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Giant_ShadowGiant.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 13\">[Shadow Giant](/Monsters.aspx?ID=681)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"LE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Giant\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=79\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Shadow\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=143\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 127 <sup>2.0</sup>, [Pathfinder #147: Tomorrow Must Burn](/Sources.aspx?ID=8) pg. 79</row>\n\n**Perception** +20; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Jotun](/Languages.aspx?ID=8), [Shadowtongue](/Languages.aspx?ID=21)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +27, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +22, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +21\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +8\r\n\r\n**Dex** +2\r\n\r\n**Con** +5\r\n\r\n**Int** +0\r\n\r\n**Wis** +1\r\n\r\n**Cha** +3\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n_+1 [resilient](/Equipment.aspx?ID=279) [breastplate](/Armor.aspx?ID=10)_, [sack with 5 rocks](/Equipment.aspx?ID=45), _+1 [striking](/Equipment.aspx?ID=280) [spiked chain](/Weapons.aspx?ID=60)_\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 33 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +25 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +20 \r\n\r\n**Will** +23 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 275\n\n**[Attack of Opportunity](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=3)** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /><br />**[Catch Rock](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=7)** <actions string=\"Reaction\" />\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 35 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\n_spiked chain _+27 ([Disarm](/Traits.aspx?ID=175), [reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192), [Trip](/Traits.aspx?ID=196)),\r\n**Damage** 3d8+18 slashing plus pall of shadow\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nfist +26 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 3d8+18 bludgeoning plus pall of shadow\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nrock +26 ([Brutal](/Traits.aspx?ID=249), [range increment 120 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=248)),\r\n**Damage** 2d8+18 bludgeoning\n\n**Pall of Shadow**  ([Divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [Necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117), [Shadow](/Traits.aspx?ID=143)) When a shadow giant hits with a melee Strike, the target must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or become [drained 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=10) and take a –1 status penalty to Perception checks involving sight as long as they remain drained.
