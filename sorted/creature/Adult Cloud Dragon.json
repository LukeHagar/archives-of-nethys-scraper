Cloud dragons range in color from light blue to a pale, milky white and have thick, curling horns and rather short snouts. They keep lairs among the extreme altitudes of the highest mountain peaks but are away on their many journeys as often as they're at home. Cloud dragons spend long hours surveying the lands they fly over from great heights, but they are creatures of whim, making it hard to predict what will pique their curiosity and bring them winging down to converse or investigate something on the ground. Cloud dragons seldom perform acts of outright malice, but they are not often charitable either. A cloud dragon is as likely to simply pluck something they desire off the ground and fly away with it as they are to bargain fairly.\n\nA cloud dragon's ever-changing interests never seem to stray toward the complicated schemes and long-term plans of other dragons. These rovers are creatures of the moment, and although they are as mentally gifted as other true dragons, their interests remain in the here and now. Yet the cloud dragon's penchant for living in the moment is not a personality flaw—they're more than capable of anticipating long-term results of their actions and won't make foolish choices simply to pursue a current interest. At the same time, cloud dragons have little interest in worrying about the future and are as confident in their ability to handle tomorrow's problems as they are today's.\n\nCloud dragon hoards tend to be well-guarded or well-hidden, as a natural result of their roving habits often taking them away from their lairs for extended periods. Their treasuries include a wide variety of items—they are driven to gather a broad range of prizes rather than collecting one type of item intensively. To a cloud dragon, a diversified hoard is a perfect hoard.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Dragon](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2)): DC 34\r\n\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Elemental](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2), [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 34\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 32\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 29\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/DragonCloud.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 14\">[Adult Cloud Dragon](/Monsters.aspx?ID=625)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Huge\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Air\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=5\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Dragon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=50\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Elemental\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=57\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 90 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +28; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), mist vision, [scent (imprecise) 60 feet](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=33)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Auran](/Languages.aspx?ID=15), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Draconic](/Languages.aspx?ID=2), [Jotun](/Languages.aspx?ID=8)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +23, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +28, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +26, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +26, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +28, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +24, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +23, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +26\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +7\r\n\r\n**Dex** +3\r\n\r\n**Con** +5\r\n\r\n**Int** +4\r\n\r\n**Wis** +6\r\n\r\n**Cha** +6\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Mist Vision** Fog and mist don't impair a cloud dragon's vision; they ignore the [concealed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=4) condition from fog and mist.\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 36 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +26 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +23 \r\n\r\n**Will** +26 \r\n\r\n+1 status to all saves vs. magic\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 254\n\n**Immunities**\r\nelectricity, [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [sleep](/Traits.aspx?ID=145)\n\n**[Frightful Presence](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=17)** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=68), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) 90 feet, DC 32<br />**Deflecting Cloud** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> **Trigger** The dragon is the target of a ranged attack; **Requirements** The dragon is aware of the attack and has a free wing; **Effect** The cloud dragon flexes a wing and creates a billowing cloud of mist.
