Upon first glance, these guardians resemble ornate doors made entirely of steel or even mithral, but when trespassers try to force their way past, the doorwarden transforms into a skilled and sturdy soldier bearing its “door” like a towering shield.\n\n Perceptive travelers can sometimes spot a door warden before its magic becomes obvious. The door often bears a round disk or similar embossment that resembles a shield boss designed for bashing, and the bar that can be lowered to block entry resembles an arm clasping a longsword by the hilt. The original doorwardens crafted by the elves included a motif of elven armor and a metal mask in the style of Alseta’s own, though other cultures embellish their own doorwardens with their own themes and sometimes even their own ancestral weapons, such as axes for dwarven doorwardens.\n\n Doorwardens sometimes know about the chambers they guard, and they have been known to speak to trespassers, especially elves. But a doorwarden cannot be persuaded to stand aside; it is bound to the portal where it has been placed and will defend it until destroyed.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Construct](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2), [Crafting](/Skills.aspx?ID=4)): DC 22\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 20\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 17\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Doorwarden.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 5\">[Doorwarden](/Monsters.aspx?ID=433)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"LN\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Construct\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=35\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #145: Hellknight Hill](/Sources.aspx?ID=4) pg. 86</row>\n\n**Perception** +13; low-light vision; _[see invisibility_](/Spells.aspx?ID=271)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +13, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +11\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +6\r\n\r\n**Dex** +0\r\n\r\n**Con** +3\r\n\r\n**Int** -1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +1\r\n\r\n**Cha** +2\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n[Longsword](/Weapons.aspx?ID=31), [steel shield](/Shields.aspx?ID=3) (Hardness 5, HP 20, BT 10) with [shield boss](/Weapons.aspx?ID=41)\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 22 (24 with shield raised)\r\n\r\n**Fort** +12 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +7 \r\n\r\n**Will** +10 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 60\n\n**Immunities**\r\nbleed, death effects, disease, doomed, drained, fatigued, healing, necromancy, nonlethal attacks, paralyzed, poison, sickened, unconscious\r\n\r\n**Resistances**\r\nphysical 5 (except bludgeoning)\n\n**Attack of Opportunity** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /><br /> **Reactive Shield** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> **Trigger** An enemy hits the doorwarden with a melee Strike. **Effect** The doorwarden can Raise its Shield and gain its shield’s benefit to AC against the triggering attack.<br /> **Shield Block** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> When the doorwarden uses Shield Block against a melee attack from a creature within 5 feet, it can also push the creature 5 feet.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 20 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nlongsword +15 ([reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192), [versatile P](/Traits.aspx?ID=200)),\r\n**Damage** 1d8+9 slashing\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nshield boss +15,\r\n**Damage** 1d6+9 bludgeoning\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\ndoor +13,\r\n**Damage** 1d4+8 bludgeoning\r\n\r\n**Arcane Innate Spells** DC 19\r\n- **2nd**\r\n[See Invisibility](/Spells.aspx?ID=271)\r\n\r\n**Imitate Door** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([Concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32)) Until the next time it acts, the doorwarden appears to be a door.
