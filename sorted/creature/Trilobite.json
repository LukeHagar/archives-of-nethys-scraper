Instead of jaws, trilobites have specialized structures called gnathobases at the base of some of their legs. These serrated and jagged structures grind and masticate any prey the trilobite latches onto, enabling the creatures to feed on anything from hard-shelled clams to soft-bodied creatures. While not particularly fast on their own, they can employ scuttling bursts of speed to dart into ocean silt or seaweed beds to escape predators.\n\n Oceanic wizards of many types employ trilobites as familiars. In addition to trilobites' durability, their ubiquity means they make capable spies for their masters as they travel unnoticed throughout the depths.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Animal](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 13\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 11\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 8\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature -1\">[Trilobite](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1347)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Tiny\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Animal\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=9\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Aquatic\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=168\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 3](/Sources.aspx?ID=66) pg. 275</row>\n\n**Perception** +8; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), [wavesense](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=41) (imprecise) 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\n\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +4, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +5, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +4\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +1\r\n\r\n**Dex** +3\r\n\r\n**Con** +2\r\n\r\n**Int** -5\r\n\r\n**Wis** +2\r\n\r\n**Cha** +0\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 15 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +4 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +7 \r\n\r\n**Will** +4 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 7\n\n**Curl Up** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> **Trigger** The trilobite takes damage; **Effect** The trilobite gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of its next turn.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** swim 25 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\ngnathobase +7 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179)),\r\n**Damage** 1d4+1 slashing\n\n**Quick Escape** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" />  The trilobite swims up to double its Speed and attempts to [Hide](/Actions.aspx?ID=62).\r\n\r\n</column>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"creature-family-271\" />",
