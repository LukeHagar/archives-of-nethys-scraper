Their inscrutability is a boon to one of their most significant interests—mercantilism— and many haughty witchwyrds openly revel in the befuddlement inspired by their mysterious guises and mannerisms. Witchwyrds have a keen eye for new opportunities and markets, and a witchwyrd almost always knows when someone is trying to pull one over on them.\n\n These four-armed humanoid creatures have hairless blue-gray skin, are typically 6-1/2 feet tall, and weigh 300 pounds. Their hands have three evenly sized and spaced digits in a tripod-like arrangement. When not trying to blend in with the local community, witchwyrds favor outlandish, loose-fitting clothes in bright reds or yellows and a signature conical hat. They tend to prefer the driest, warmest regions of the lands they visit—perhaps an indicator of their mysterious home world. This, however, is the only indicator; witchwyrds are notoriously close-mouthed about details of this distant world, and with good reason: most witchwyrds on Golarion have never visited their ancestral home. To these witchwyrds, the notion of a home planet is a constant thorn in their side, and when asked, many choose to ignore the question altogether. Others are so agitated by these queries that they respond with impatience or even violence. Some scholars have theorized a connection between witchwyrds and several other four-armed creatures, but like with questions of their place of origin, witchwyrds have little to say about the topic.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 24\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 22\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 19\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Witchwyrd.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 6\">[Witchwyrd](/Monsters.aspx?ID=861)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"LN\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 294 <sup>2.0</sup>, [Pathfinder #149: Against the Scarlet Triad](/Sources.aspx?ID=14) pg. 90</row>\n\n**Perception** +12; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Draconic](/Languages.aspx?ID=2); one or more planar languages; [_tongues_](/Spells.aspx?ID=340)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2) +16, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +15, [Desert Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +14, [one or more Lore skills related to a specific plane](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +14, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +15, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +15\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +3\r\n\r\n**Dex** +3\r\n\r\n**Con** +1\r\n\r\n**Int** +4\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** +5\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n_+1 [ranseur](/Weapons.aspx?ID=35)_\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 22 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +13 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +13 \r\n\r\n**Will** +15 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 110\n\n**Resistances**\r\nforce 5\n\n**Absorb Force** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> ([arcane](/Traits.aspx?ID=11), [evocation](/Traits.aspx?ID=65), [force](/Traits.aspx?ID=75)) **Frequency** once per round; **Trigger** A [_magic missile_](/Spells.aspx?ID=180) is fired at the witchwyrd, and the witchwyrd is aware of it and has a free hand; **Effect** The witchwyrd “catches” the missile, absorbing it and causing that hand to glow while it holds this energy.
