They tame insects, spiders, and other such creatures to serve as faithful allies. Mitflits have lost most of their ancestral gremlin magic, leaving these incomplete beings full of doubt and insecurity. Mitflits find companionship in the other base creatures of the world, and forge bonds of friendship with vermin, the only other beings that seem willing to accept them. A social structure, even one in which they are bullied, partially fills the hole within mitflits’ personalities, and they rarely rebel or rail out unless their rage hits a breaking point.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Fey](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 13\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 11\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 8\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Gremlin_Mitflit.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature -1\">[Mitflit](/Monsters.aspx?ID=245)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"LE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Small\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fey\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=69\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Gremlin\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=221\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 192</row>\n\n**Perception** +4; darkvision, scent (imprecise) 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Undercommon](/Languages.aspx?ID=11)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +5, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +1, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +3, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +5, [Thievery](/Skills.aspx?ID=17) +5\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** -1\r\n\r\n**Dex** +3\r\n\r\n**Con** +0\r\n\r\n**Int** -1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +1\r\n\r\n**Cha** -1\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Self-Loathing** ([emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) A mitflit’s self-loathing makes it easy to influence.
