Cuetzmonquali is capable of growing any number of horns from its head, on which it can impale and trap its enemies. Each horn grows in a burst of searing flame that burns flesh and scales and results in a blackened obsidian spike jutting from its forehead. These horns molt off occasionally, leaving behind warnings of the beast's presence.\n\n In combat, Cuetzmonquali is a terrifying foe who uses its horns to skewer foes, unleashes white-hot blasts of flame to devastate those who don't approach, and injects a potent burning venom that ignites a foe from within their own body, sapping their strength. Against groups of weaker foes, it simply tramples them to death underfoot. Anyone courageous enough to face Cuetzmonquali and powerful or cunning enough to slay the creature can lay claim to the treasure that lies in its belly: the legendary artifact known as the [_Spear of the Destroyer's Flame_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=1472).\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Beast](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2), [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 46\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 44\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 41\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Cuetzmonquali.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 17\">[Cuetzmonquali](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1722)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Unique\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=161\" />\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Huge\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Beast\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=20\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fire\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=72\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Monsters of Myth](/Sources.aspx?ID=107) pg. 16</row>\n\n**Perception** +32; [greater darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), [scent](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=33) (imprecise) 60 feet, smoke vision\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Abyssal](/Languages.aspx?ID=12), [Ignan](/Languages.aspx?ID=18), [Requian](/Languages.aspx?ID=34); (can't speak any language)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +30, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +33, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +30, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +28, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +30\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +9\r\n\r\n**Dex** +5\r\n\r\n**Con** +8\r\n\r\n**Int** -2\r\n\r\n**Wis** +4\r\n\r\n**Cha** +3\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Follower of the Flame** Cuetzmonquali recognizes the might of the wielder of the _[Spear of the Destroyer's Flame](/Equipment.aspx?ID=1472)_.
