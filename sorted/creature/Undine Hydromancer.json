These planar scions are often athletic and lithe, but they are easily distracted by auditory sensations because of how much louder and clearer sound rings above the waves.\n\n Undines are perhaps the most settled of all geniekin, often forming communities along the coast or even on the water itself. In the latter case, they prefer to settle in ship-towns that sometimes number dozens of vessels in all shapes and sizes. The undines who fill these communities are similarly diverse, bringing aspects of multiple cultures together to form one whole. Ship-towns are permanent, but fluid—they grow, recede, and migrate constantly as undine families add their ships to or remove them from the flotilla. An undine town like this may remain at sea for years, its residents coming ashore only on rare occasions to collect wood for cookfires or to repair their homes. The paradoxically ever-shifting permanence of these communities reflects the undine virtues of adaptability and freedom, while also maintaining the prime importance of the community.\n\n Undine hydromancers are quite valued on these floating settlements, if only for their ability to create fresh drinking water while adrift on the sea.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 15\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 13\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 10\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/PlanarScion_Undine.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 1\">[Undine Hydromancer](/Monsters.aspx?ID=763)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"CG\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Amphibious\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=207\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Human\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=90\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Undine\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=314\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 203 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +5\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Aquan](/Languages.aspx?ID=14), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2) +3, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +3, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +7, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +7, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +5, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +5\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +0\r\n\r\n**Dex** +2\r\n\r\n**Con** +1\r\n\r\n**Int** +0\r\n\r\n**Wis** +2\r\n\r\n**Cha** +4\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n[Dagger](/Weapons.aspx?ID=3)\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 16 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +4 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +5 \r\n\r\n**Will** +7 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 15\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 25 feet, swim 25 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\ndagger +7 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179), [versatile S](/Traits.aspx?ID=200)),\r\n**Damage** 1d4 piercing\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\ndagger +7 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [thrown 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=195), [versatile S](/Traits.aspx?ID=200)),\r\n**Damage** 1d4 piercing\r\n\r\n**Primal Spontaneous Spells** DC 17, attack +9\r\n- **Cantrips (1st)**\r\n[Acid Splash](/Spells.aspx?ID=3), [Detect Magic](/Spells.aspx?ID=66), [Know Direction](/Spells.aspx?ID=169), [Stabilize](/Spells.aspx?ID=307), [Tanglefoot](/Spells.aspx?ID=330)\r\n- **1st**\r\n[Create Water](/Spells.aspx?ID=53), [Heal](/Spells.aspx?ID=148), [Hydraulic Push](/Spells.aspx?ID=154)\r\n\r\n**Sorcerer Bloodline Spells** DC 17, attack +9,  (1 Focus Point)\r\n- **1st**\r\n[Elemental Toss](/Spells.aspx?ID=505)\n\n</column>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"creature-family-145\" />",
