They dedicate their entire lives to the preservation of nature—a role that they believe nature itself has selected them to carry out. Wood giants are patient and kind to those who show respect and care for wild places. Although most wood giants consider civilization as simply another part of the world, they value places untouched by permanent structures and dense humanoid settlements.\n\n Wood giants have long, drooping ears and more slender builds than most giants. Despite their size, they are graceful and agile, able to move through dense forests and brush with little sound. They have been known to work closely with druids and others who share their respect for the sanctity of wilderness regions. Wood giants spend their days patrolling vast swaths of territory, foraging, and keeping an eye out for any who would despoil their lands. While they respect the connection to nature they share with many fey creatures and remain on good terms with them, wood giants see most fey as far too flighty to take part in any long-term plans.\n\n An average wood giant stands 14 feet tall and weighs 1,200 pounds.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 22\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 20\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 17\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Giant_WoodGiant.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 6\">[Wood Giant](/Monsters.aspx?ID=678)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"CG\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Giant\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=79\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 124 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +15; low-light vision\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Jotun](/Languages.aspx?ID=8), [Sylvan](/Languages.aspx?ID=10); [_speak with animals_](/Spells.aspx?ID=293)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +13, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +15, [Forest Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +14, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +14, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +13, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +13\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +5\r\n\r\n**Dex** +5\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** +2\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** +1\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n[Hide Armor](/Armor.aspx?ID=7), [_+1 composite longbow _](/Weapons.aspx?ID=74) (20 arrows), [Shortsword](/Weapons.aspx?ID=43)\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 24 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +17 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +14 \r\n\r\n**Will** +13 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 120\n\n**[Catch Rock](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=7)** <actions string=\"Reaction\" />\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 35 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nshortsword +17 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192), [versatile S](/Traits.aspx?ID=200)),\r\n**Damage** 1d8+11 piercing\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nfist +17 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 1d6+11 bludgeoning\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\n_composite longbow_ +18 ([deadly d10](/Traits.aspx?ID=174), [range increment 100 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=248), [reload 0](/Traits.aspx?ID=254), [volley 30 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=201)),\r\n**Damage** 1d8+8 piercing\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nrock +17 ([Brutal](/Traits.aspx?ID=249), [range increment 120 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=248)),\r\n**Damage** 2d6+11 bludgeoning\r\n\r\n**Primal Innate Spells** DC 23\r\n- **2nd**\r\n[Entangle](/Spells.aspx?ID=103), [Tree Shape](/Spells.aspx?ID=342)\r\n- **3rd**\r\n[Earthbind](/Spells.aspx?ID=94)\r\n- **4th**\r\n[Speak with Plants](/Spells.aspx?ID=294)\r\n- **Constant (2nd)**\r\n[Pass Without Trace](/Spells.aspx?ID=215), [Speak with Animals](/Spells.aspx?ID=293)\r\n\r\n**Piercing Shot** <actions string=\"Single Action\" />  The wood giant shoots an arrow at a target so that it glances off the first target to strike another target behind the first one.
