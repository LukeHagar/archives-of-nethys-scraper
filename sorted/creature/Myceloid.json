For a myceloid colony, any battle with humanoids is cause for excitement, as this new fodder presents so many delicious possibilities.\n\n Myceloids consider humanoids to have an ideal life cycle of four simple steps. During childhood, they wander naive and afraid, unaware of myceloid colonies. In adulthood, humanoids discover their true purpose as they taste purple pox and become enslaved by the myceloids' spores. Next, they die, giving rise to a new myceloid. They're then sent on to the afterlife upon becoming a myceloid meal. Eating humanoid flesh is not a necessity—a myceloid can survive on any decaying matter—but it's certainly a pleasure.\n\n Myceloids rarely make alliances, but when they do, they invite their new allies to share a meal to seal the pact. Few outsiders appreciate this hospitality. Most myceloids have deep purple caps studded with off-white lumps. Their necks and bodies bear resemblance to the stipes of tough, leathery fungi. Smaller mushrooms often grow on a myceloid's body, which the creatures view as either adornments or particularly convenient snacks. They stand roughly as tall as a [dwarf](/Ancestries.aspx?ID=1), with comparably stout builds.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Fungus](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 19\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 17\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 14\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Myceloid.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 4\">[Myceloid](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1242)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fungus\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=77\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 3](/Sources.aspx?ID=66) pg. 181</row>\n\n**Perception** +10; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), [scent](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=33) (imprecise) 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Undercommon](/Languages.aspx?ID=11); [telepathy](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=37) 100 feet (myceloids and those afflicted by purple pox only)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +11, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +10\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +4\r\n\r\n**Dex** +3\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** -1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +2\r\n\r\n**Cha** +0\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 20 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +14 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +9 \r\n\r\n**Will** +10 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 70\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\nslashing 5\r\n\r\n**Spore Pop** If a myceloid is reduced to 0 HP by a critical hit, it pops, forcing it to immediately Emit Spores, even if it has already used the ability that day.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 20 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nfist +14,\r\n**Damage** 2d6+4 bludgeoning plus purple pox\n\n**Emit Spores** <actions string=\"Single Action\" />  **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The myceloid expels spores in a 10-foot burst centered on a corner of its own space.
