Guards usually operate in pairs or small groups, but when a serious emergency threatens, guards muster at the nearest keep, watch station, or other rallying point and then move out in search of their quarry. Alternatively, guard troops might be stationed at important locations in the city, such as the front gates, the main prison, or the entrance to the ruler's castle.\n\n Individual guards may not be particularly well trained or experienced, but in large numbers they can defeat bandits, wild creatures that have slipped past the city gates, or the occasional drunken [ogre](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=78). A group of city guards is usually accompanied and commanded by a single captain, who does most of the talking and gives individual guards their orders. The members of this city guard squadron have trained together to perform simple tactics but not advanced maneuvers.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 20\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 18\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 15\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/CityGuard_Squadron.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 5\">[City Guard Squadron](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1094)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"LN\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Gargantuan\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Human\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=90\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Troop\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=367\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 3](/Sources.aspx?ID=66) pg. 47</row>\n\n**Perception** +12\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +14, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +11, [Settlement Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +9\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +5\r\n\r\n**Dex** +0\r\n\r\n**Con** +3\r\n\r\n**Int** +0\r\n\r\n**Wis** +2\r\n\r\n**Cha** +2\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Seek Quarry** City guards can spend 1 minute to designate a single creature for whom they have a physical description as their quarry.
