When the plant senses the approach of suitable prey through its sensitive, shallowly buried root system, it rises up like an agitated snake and unfurls its brightly colored bloom, an act that releases a cloud of mind-numbing pollen. Persistent stories claim the viper vine can lure prey into its clutches by swaying with a hypnotic motion, but this effect is in fact created by this invisible, odorless pollen cloud.\n\n Since a viper vine gains nourishment by consuming creatures rather than through ingesting moisture and soil, it has developed rudimentary locomotion and can drag itself along the ground with its tentacle-like roots. It even has a form of rudimentary sentience, allowing it to not only discern differences in prey and make limited tactical decisions, but also to avoid creatures that are particularly large or dangerous-looking.\n\n The area around viper vine hunting grounds is often strewn with the partially devoured remains of victims. It's not unusual to find the rotting corpses of wild animals, ill-fated adventurers, and even giants in the plant's immediate vicinity, along with a scattering of incidental treasure left behind on the corpses. A viper vine rarely returns to the carcass of a creature it killed earlier, preferring to hunt fresh meat.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Plant](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 31\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 29\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 26\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/ViperVine.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 13\">[Viper Vine](/Monsters.aspx?ID=854)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Plant\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=125\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 287 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +22; [low-light vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=23), [tremorsense (imprecise) 60 feet](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=40)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\n\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +27, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +24\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +8\r\n\r\n**Dex** +5\r\n\r\n**Con** +7\r\n\r\n**Int** -4\r\n\r\n**Wis** +5\r\n\r\n**Cha** -3\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 33 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +26 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +24 \r\n\r\n**Will** +22 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 270\n\n**Resistances**\r\npoison 15\n\n**Cold Vulnerability** When exposed to a [cold](/Traits.aspx?ID=27) effect, the viper vine is overwhelmed by lethargy, becoming [slowed 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=35) for 1d4 rounds.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 20 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njaws +27 ([reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 3d6+11 piercing plus 3d6 poison\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nvine +27 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [reach 15 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 3d10+11 bludgeoning plus [Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=18)\n\n**Captivating Pollen** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([Enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61), [Incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=93), [Mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [Poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126)) The viper vine releases a 60-foot emanation of invisible pollen that stays in the air for 5 rounds unless dispersed by a moderate or stronger wind.
