Many who have assumed that their adorability and relatively small size equates to safety have met swift and grisly ends on a whimwyrm's fangs or magic.\n\n A whimwyrm is a slender, sleek dragon, not much longer than seven feet from snout to tail, but its speed in combat is unnerving. When a whimwyrm attacks, be it with its fanged mouth or its long tail, it makes several quick, darting snaps or lashes at once.
