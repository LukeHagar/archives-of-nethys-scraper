Their petals radiate from their heads in various hues with a serrated, leafy, beard-like ruff. When particularly excited, their eyes and petals glow with collected sunlight, and when they become depressed or saddened, their usually vibrant coloration grows correspondingly muted. These shifts in coloration are echoed in sunflower leshy art, which can lead to unexpected color palettes for artworks. For example, a human artist might illustrate Hell as a place of glowing lava and flickering flames, drawing upon many vibrant colors, but to a sunflower leshy, the only proper way to depict a place like Hell is in morose grays, blacks, and whites.\n\n The more adventurous sunflower leshys leave their communities to grow bonds with nearby settlements of humanoids. When interacting with humanoids, sunflower leshys are some of the most likely to act friendly and give strangers a chance to prove their good intentions, though they remain cautious. They're often accompanied by other, more powerful leshys.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Plant](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 15\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 13\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 10\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Leshy_SunflowerLeshy.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 1\">[Sunflower Leshy](/Monsters.aspx?ID=716)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Small\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Leshy\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=225\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Plant\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=125\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 160 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +7; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Druidic](/Languages.aspx?ID=23), [Sylvan](/Languages.aspx?ID=10); [_speak with plants_](/Spells.aspx?ID=294) (sunflowers only)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +6, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +8, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +5, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +7\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +0\r\n\r\n**Dex** +3\r\n\r\n**Con** +1\r\n\r\n**Int** +0\r\n\r\n**Wis** +2\r\n\r\n**Cha** +3\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 16 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +4 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +10 \r\n\r\n**Will** +7 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 20\n\n**Heliotrope** <actions string=\"Free Action\" /> ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [evocation](/Traits.aspx?ID=65), [light](/Traits.aspx?ID=100), [primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=134)) 20 feet; **Requirements** The sunflower leshy begins its turn in an area of bright light; **Effect** The sunflower leshy reflects the sun or another source of bright light from their face.
