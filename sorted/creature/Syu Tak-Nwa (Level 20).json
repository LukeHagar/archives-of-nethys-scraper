This makes her immune to tripping, and she ignores the effects of difficult terrain (but not greater difficult terrain). She can use her living hair to perform precise tasks such as picking up objects and performing simple Interact actions. She can also deliver hexes through her hair. Whenever Tak-nwa successfully casts a [hex](/Traits.aspx?ID=324) focus spell that requires 2 or more actions to cast and that doesn't require a spell attack roll, if her target is within reach, as part of the spellcasting activity she can make a hair Strike against the foe before applying any effects of the hex. If this Strike misses, the hex has no effect.\r\n\r\n**Familiar**   Tak-nwa's familiar is an elephant hawk moth named Yon-so. Yon-so has a fly Speed of 40 feet, [darkvision](/Familiars.aspx?ID=5), and [scent](/Familiars.aspx?ID=11) as an imprecise sense to a range of 30 feet. Yon-so can speak Tien, and when Yon-so rolls a success on a Reflex or Fortitude save it takes no damage against the effect.\r\n\r\n**Silkworm's Basket** <actions string=\"Three Actions\" /> ([Certain Kill](/Traits.aspx?ID=384), [Conjuration](/Traits.aspx?ID=33)) Syu Tak-nwa tears thousands of minute portals into space, sending a single hair through each. The hairs emerge at a space within 30 feet, braiding and twining together to create a cube 20 feet to each side. This has the effects of a 10th-level [_force cage_](/Spells.aspx?ID=690), except that Syu Tak-nwa does not need to sustain the basket; it has a duration of 1 minute. While the Silkworm's Basket persists, Syu Tak-nwa is [quickened](/Conditions.aspx?ID=32) and can use the extra action only to make a hair or braid Strike against any target within the basket, regardless of her distance to them. She can't create more than one basket at a time.\r\n\r\n</column>",
