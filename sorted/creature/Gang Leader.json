Evasion When the gang leader rolls a success on a Reflex save, they get a critical success instead. Surprise Attack On the first round of combat, if the gang leader rolls Deception or Stealth for initiative, creatures who haven't acted are flat-footed to the gang leader. Nimble Dodge Reaction Trigger The gang leader is targeted with an attack by an attacker they can see; Effect The gang leader gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against the triggering attack. --- Speed 30 feet Melee Single Action shortsword +18 (Agile, Magical, versatile S), Damage 1d6+10 piercing Ranged Single Action sling +18 (Propulsive, range increment 50 feet, reload 1), Damage 1d6+8 bludgeoning Brutal Rally Reaction (Auditory, Emotion, Linguistic, Mental) Trigger The gang leader rolls a critical hit against a creature; Effect All allies that can see the gang leader gain a +1 circumstance bonus to attack rolls until the start of the gang leader's next turn. Gang Up Any enemy is flat-footed against the gang leader's melee attacks due to flanking as long as the enemy is within melee reach of both the gang leader and one of the gang leader's allies. Quick Draw Single Action The gang leader Interacts to draw a weapon, then Strikes with that weapon. Sneak Attack The gang leader deals an extra 2d6 precision damage to flat-footed creatures.
