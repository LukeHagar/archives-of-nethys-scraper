Although they typically make their lairs among the highlands, the pursuit of justice leads silver dragons to travel far and wide—often into the very heart of realms overrun by evil. These exemplars of righteousness are ceaseless in their determination to help the weak, spread honor, and stamp out evil.\n\n Silver dragons are sleek and sinuous. Their hides resemble nothing so much as a suit of gleaming armor, lending further credence to the popular myth that silver dragons are the paladins of dragonkind. The zeal with which they seek out, confront, and defeat evil is unsurpassed even among their metallic cousins, and they adhere to strict codes of honor usually passed down from parent to hatchling. On occasion, they instead learn these codes from trusted mentors, usually other silver dragons or gold dragons. As they age, they become even more dedicated to their codes, often adding new and even more restrictive clauses to the systems that guide their behavior.\n\n Silver dragons are incredibly altruistic and regularly consort with the citizens of goodly societies, of which they consider themselves protectors and guides. In addition to responding to evil threats, silver dragons work to prevent evil from taking root in the first place, and they ensure mortals under their care are well fed, educated, and treated with dignity. Although silver dragons can seem overzealous or even eager to join the fight against evil, they know that the best way to rid the world of corruption is to stamp out strife and disillusionment at their source, not to passively sit back and watch it grow into an unsolvable problem. Silver dragons can be vindictive, but they can also be forgiving; for evildoers who seek to atone for their sins and turn over a new leaf, the support of a silver dragon is both unwavering and invaluable.\n\n Many silver dragons are also drawn to religious endeavors, venerating deities such as Iomedae, Sarenrae, and other deities concerned with justice, virtue, and redemption.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Dragon](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2)): DC 41\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 39\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 36\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/DragonSilver_AncientSilverDragon.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 19\">[Ancient Silver Dragon](/Monsters.aspx?ID=156)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"LG\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Gargantuan\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Cold\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=27\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Dragon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=50\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 127</row>\n\n**Perception** +32; darkvision, fog vision, scent (imprecise) 60 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Auran](/Languages.aspx?ID=15), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Draconic](/Languages.aspx?ID=2), [Dwarven](/Languages.aspx?ID=3), [Sylvan](/Languages.aspx?ID=10)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +27, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +38, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +34, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +37, [Medicine](/Skills.aspx?ID=9) +33, [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13) +32, [Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14) +30\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +9\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +5\r\n\r\n**Int** +5\r\n\r\n**Wis** +5\r\n\r\n**Cha** +7\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Fog Vision** The silver dragon ignores the concealed condition from fog and clouds.\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 45 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +34 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +31 \r\n\r\n**Will** +34 \r\n\r\n+1 status to all saves vs. magic\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 410\n\n**Immunities**\r\ncold, paralyzed, sleep\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\nfire 15\r\n\r\n**Frightful Presence** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=68), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) 90 feet, DC 40<br /> **Cold Aura** ([cold](/Traits.aspx?ID=27), [aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206)) 15 feet, 3d6 cold damage.
