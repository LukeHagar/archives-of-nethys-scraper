The truth is even worse: a _final blade_ contains only a limited amount of metaphysical space to hold souls, and once it's full, the souls coalesce into a fearsome, malevolent entity called a gray death. The more souls trapped by a _final blade_, the more powerful the gray death becomes. A gray death doesn't pose much of a threat while contained within the _final blade_, other than to give the guillotine an aura of palpable malevolence. When freed, however, the gray death becomes a nearly unstoppable menace.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Spirit](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11)): DC 45\r\n\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Undead](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 45\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 43\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 40\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 20\">[Gray Death](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1641)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Rare\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=137\" />\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Huge\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Incorporeal\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=222\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Spirit\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=149\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Undead\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=160\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Night of the Gray Death](/Sources.aspx?ID=99) pg. 68</row>\n\n**Perception** +33; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), [lifesense](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=21) 1,000 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1); telepathy 100 feet\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +40, [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11) +34, [Performance](/Skills.aspx?ID=12) +38, [Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14) +34\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** -5\r\n\r\n**Dex** +7\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** +6\r\n\r\n**Wis** +7\r\n\r\n**Cha** +10\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**[Lifesense](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=21)** ([divination](/Traits.aspx?ID=47), [occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120)) A gray death senses the vital essence of living creatures within range.\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 44 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +31 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +35 \r\n\r\n**Will** +33 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 330\n\n**Immunities**\r\ndisease, fear, paralyzed, poison, precision, unconcious\r\n\r\n**Resistances**\r\nall damage 15 (except force, _ghost touch_, or positive; double resistance vs. non-magical)\r\n\r\n**Weaknesses**\r\nmental 15\r\n\r\n**Soul Bleed** ([aura](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=5), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117), [occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120)) 1,000 feet.
