If even a single worm escapes, the worm that walks will eventually re-form using a process that typically takes 1d10 days.<br /> While the exact circumstances and surroundings determine how long the worm that walks's foes have to dispatch the fleeing worms before they escape, usually its foes have only a single round. Typically, this requires the application of an area effect or [splash](/Traits.aspx?ID=150) weapon within 1 round to the space where the worm that walks collapsed. After any amount of area or splash damage is dealt to that space, the character dealing the damage must attempt a DC 15 flat check. Each subsequent area or splash damage effect performed on the area reduces the DC of this flat check by 2, to a minimum of DC 5. If any of these flat checks succeed, none of the worms escape, and the worm that walks is destroyed permanently. At the GM's discretion, clever means of trapping or otherwise detaining the vermin may extend the time allowed to finish off the worm that walks.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\ntendril +29 ([reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 4d8+14 [persistent piercing damage](/Conditions.aspx?ID=29)\r\n\r\n**Occult Spontaneous Spells** DC 34, attack +26\r\n- **Cantrips (7th)**\r\n[Daze](/Spells.aspx?ID=61), [Detect Magic](/Spells.aspx?ID=66), [Light](/Spells.aspx?ID=171), [Mage Hand](/Spells.aspx?ID=177), [Shield](/Spells.aspx?ID=280)\r\n- **1st**\r\n[Charm](/Spells.aspx?ID=34), [Illusory Disguise](/Spells.aspx?ID=159), [Mindlink](/Spells.aspx?ID=195), [Ray of Enfeeblement](/Spells.aspx?ID=244) (4 slots)\r\n- **2nd**\r\n[Comprehend Language](/Spells.aspx?ID=46), [Illusory Creature](/Spells.aspx?ID=158), [Mirror Image](/Spells.aspx?ID=197), [Undetectable Alignment](/Spells.aspx?ID=348) (4 slots)\r\n- **3rd**\r\n[Dream Message](/Spells.aspx?ID=90), [Haste](/Spells.aspx?ID=147), [Hypercognition](/Spells.aspx?ID=156), [Slow](/Spells.aspx?ID=289) (4 slots)\r\n- **4th**\r\n[Dimension Door](/Spells.aspx?ID=69), [Modify Memory](/Spells.aspx?ID=200), [Suggestion](/Spells.aspx?ID=315), [Veil](/Spells.aspx?ID=355) (4 slots)\r\n- **5th**\r\n[Black Tentacles](/Spells.aspx?ID=23), [Mind Probe](/Spells.aspx?ID=193), [Phantom Pain](/Spells.aspx?ID=220), [Subconscious Suggestion](/Spells.aspx?ID=314) (4 slots)\r\n- **6th**\r\n[Dispel Magic](/Spells.aspx?ID=78), [Dominate](/Spells.aspx?ID=87), [Paranoia](/Spells.aspx?ID=214), [Summon Entity](/Spells.aspx?ID=321) (4 slots)\r\n- **7th**\r\n[Phantasmal Killer](/Spells.aspx?ID=219), [Visions of Danger](/Spells.aspx?ID=358), [Warp Mind](/Spells.aspx?ID=369) (3 slots)\r\n\r\n**Squirming Embrace** <actions string=\"Single Action\" />  The worm that walks Strides, ending its movement sharing a space with a creature, and deals 5d8 piercing damage to the creature.
