She spent her younger days sneaking away from her village to explore Nantambu, and the need to avoid watchful eyes, be they grippli or Nantambiyan, quickly taught Muruwa the necessity of stealth. While she initially used her sojourns into the city to make off with sweets and other snacks, Muruwa found herself returning to learn more about the city's people. It was during one of these visits that Muruwa learned of the Magaambya and began to develop a fascination with magic.\n\n As her curiosity grew, Muruwa decided to enroll in the Magaambya, and so she set out for Nantambu one last time. After arriving, the intrepid grippli took to living on the streets and earning coin through various odd jobs. Once she saved enough money to buy her first set of supplies, she enrolled in the academy. Muruwa now dedicates most of her time to learning all that she can about magic and the world beyond the jungle she calls home.\n\n Muruwa has a difficult time relating with others and takes a while to open up. She's found that sharing stories about life in the jungle with Kalaggi comes naturally, though, and Muruwa considers the Ekujae elf to be her closest friend at the academy.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 25\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 23\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 20\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 1\">[Muruwa](/NPCs.aspx?ID=1752)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Unique\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=161\" />\r\n<trait label=\"CG\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Grippli\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=264\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Threshold of Knowledge](/Sources.aspx?ID=109) pg. 13</row>\n\n**Perception** +6; low-light vision\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Elven](/Languages.aspx?ID=4), [Grippli](/Languages.aspx?ID=48), [Mwangi](/Languages.aspx?ID=39)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +6, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +6, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +3, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +3, [Insect Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +4, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +3, [Jungle Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +4, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +4, [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11) +4, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +6, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +4, [Thievery](/Skills.aspx?ID=17) +6\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +3\r\n\r\n**Dex** +3\r\n\r\n**Con** +1\r\n\r\n**Int** +1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +1\r\n\r\n**Cha** +0\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n[Backpack](/Equipment.aspx?ID=4), [Chalk](/Equipment.aspx?ID=12) (10), [Crowbar](/Equipment.aspx?ID=18), [Dagger](/Weapons.aspx?ID=3) (2), [Hand Adze](/Weapons.aspx?ID=144), [Hand Crossbow](/Weapons.aspx?ID=69) (10 bolts), [minor elixir of life](/Equipment.aspx?ID=91), [Studded Leather Armor](/Armor.aspx?ID=5), [Thieves' Tools](/Equipment.aspx?ID=58), [Writing Set](/Equipment.aspx?ID=63), 3 sp\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 18 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +4 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +8 \r\n\r\n**Will** +6 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 15\n\n**Nimble Dodge** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> **Trigger** Muruwa is targeted with a melee or ranged attack by an attacker she can see; **Effect** Muruwa gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against the triggering attack.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 25 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\ndagger +6 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179), [versatile S](/Traits.aspx?ID=200)),\r\n**Damage** 1d4+3 piercing\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nhand adze +6 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Forceful](/Traits.aspx?ID=180), [Grippli](/Traits.aspx?ID=264), [Sweep](/Traits.aspx?ID=194)),\r\n**Damage** 1d6+3 piercing\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\ndagger +6 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [thrown 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=195), [versatile S](/Traits.aspx?ID=200)),\r\n**Damage** 1d4+3 piercing\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nhand adze +6 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Forceful](/Traits.aspx?ID=180), [Grippli](/Traits.aspx?ID=264), [Sweep](/Traits.aspx?ID=194), [thrown 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=195)),\r\n**Damage** 1d6+3 piercing\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nhand crossbow +6 ([range increment 60 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=248), [reload 1](/Traits.aspx?ID=254)),\r\n**Damage** 1d6 piercing\n\n**Snaptongue Grippli**   Muruwa increases her [unarmed](/Traits.aspx?ID=199) reach by 5 feet when delivering touch range spells and when performing any Interact actions she could perform with one hand.\r\n\r\n**[Sneak Attack](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=34)**   Muruwa deals an additional 1d6 precision damage to [flat-footed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=16) creatures.\r\n\r\n**Surprise Attack**   On the first round of combat, if Muruwa rolls [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) or [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) for initiative, creatures that haven't acted yet are [flat-footed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=16) to her.\r\n\r\n**Ancestry Feat**   [Grippli Weapon Familiarity](/Feats.aspx?ID=2818)\r\n\r\n**Class Feat**   [Nimble Dodge](/Feats.aspx?ID=550)\r\n\r\n**Skill Feats**   [Forager](/Feats.aspx?ID=786), [Quick Jump](/Feats.aspx?ID=825)\r\n\r\n</column>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"creature-family-298\" />",
