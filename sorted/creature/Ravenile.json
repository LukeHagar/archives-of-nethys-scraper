Almost twice as large as typical iruxis, raveniles have a more ferocious set of jaws and deadly claws. A ravenile's tail is much shorter than that of lizardfolk, however, lacking the heft to make it an effective natural weapon. Raveniles are as intelligent as their iruxi cousins, though many assume they are mindless brutes from their bestial appearance.\n\n Raveniles hatch from eggs fertilized not by other iruxis, but by predatory extraplanar scavengers. Many lizardfolk tell stories—some true, some merely myth—of these scavengers to reinforce cultural taboos against leaving eggs undefended. At birth, raveniles look like other iruxi children, though perhaps they exhibit small hints of what they will become: a stubbier tail, wider feet, or a single tusk-like tooth. As raveniles age, they develop an increased appetite and metabolism. During one painful week at the cusp of maturity, raveniles experience an agonizing growth spurt. They shed their skin at least twice a day, their muscle mass increases exponentially, and their bones crack and reset. During this transformation, raveniles experience immense pain and exhibit reflexive violence. When the transformation is complete, the ravenile regains their wits, but by then, they've usually caused irreparable harm. Few lizardfolk communities welcome raveniles after their transformation, and some settlements suffer so much damage that they must be abandoned entirely.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 37\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 35\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 32\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Ravenile.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 14\">[Ravenile](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1002)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Rare\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=137\" />\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Lizardfolk\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=226\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #159: All or Nothing](/Sources.aspx?ID=48) pg. 84</row>\n\n**Perception** +25\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Draconic](/Languages.aspx?ID=2), [Iruxi](/Languages.aspx?ID=32)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +25, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +28, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +28, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +23, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +23\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +8\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +5\r\n\r\n**Int** -1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +1\r\n\r\n**Cha** +0\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Deep Breath** A ravenile can hold their breath for 20 minutes.\r\n\r\n**Items**\r\n_+1 [resilient](/Equipment.aspx?ID=279) [studded leather armor](/Armor.aspx?ID=5)_\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 24 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +29 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +26 \r\n\r\n**Will** +23 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 306\r\n\r\n, regeneration 20 (deactivated by fire or acid)\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\nfire 10\r\n\r\n**[Attack of Opportunity](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=3)** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> \r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 20 feet, swim 10 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njaws +29 ([reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 3d10+12 piercing\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nclaw +29 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 3d8+8 slashing\n\n**Forced Regeneration** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([Concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32)) **Requirements** The ravenile's regeneration is currently active; **Effect** The ravenile regains 20 HP.\r\n\r\n**Furious Wallop** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" />  **Requirements** The ravenile's regeneration is currently deactivated; **Effect** The ravenile makes a melee Strike.
