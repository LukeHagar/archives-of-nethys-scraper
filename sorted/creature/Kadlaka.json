Though they shy from most humanoids, kadlakas readily form friendships with ravens and other birds, and they sometimes make temporary alliances with people who prove themselves capable stewards of wild animals and the natural order of things. When they do settle on a roost—whether for a single season or a lifetime—kadlakas often position themselves as guardians of a natural feature or local flock.
