The zelekhut resembles a mechanical centaur crafted from silvery metal with golden clockwork wings adorning its back. Instead of hands, the zelekhut's arms end in long, barbed chains that crackle with electricity. Whether sent by the powers of Axis or summoned by mortal authorities, the zelekhut seeks out those who continually evade justice—either through active flight, or by abusing their power and station—so as to bring justice to the multiverse's most notorious fugitives and criminals. Indeed, many a zelekhut's quarry are as famous for their ability to evade capture as for the crimes they commit.\n\nThough the zelekhut is implacable and unrelenting in enforcing sentences, it does not pass judgments of its own or take the initiative in pursuing targets of opportunity. While hunting a condemned serial killer or notorious thief across half a dozen planes, the zelekhut wouldn't shift a single hoof to capture a corrupt ruler whose offenses are far greater. All zelekhuts understand that laws can and must differ from place to place, and it is not the zelekhut's job to moralize, merely to obey its rightful assignments and track down those who seek to flee their punishment.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Monitor](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 26\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 24\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 21\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Aeon_Zelekhut.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 9\">[Zelekhut](/Monsters.aspx?ID=537)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"LN\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Aeon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=208\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Inevitable\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=223\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Monitor\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=111\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 9 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +21; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), [_true seeing_](/Spells.aspx?ID=344)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Celestial](/Languages.aspx?ID=16), [Infernal](/Languages.aspx?ID=19), [Utopian](/Languages.aspx?ID=36); truespeech\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +18, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +21, [Axis Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +15, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +16, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +21\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +6\r\n\r\n**Dex** +5\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** +0\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** +3\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Truespeech** A zelekhut can speak with and understand any creature with a language.\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 28 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +17 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +20 \r\n\r\n**Will** +18 \r\n\r\n+1 status to all saves vs. magic\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 160\n\n**Immunities**\r\ndeath effects, disease, emotion, poison, unconscious\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\nchaotic 10\r\n\r\n**[Attack of Opportunity](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=3)** <actions string=\"Reaction\" />\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 40 feet, fly 40 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nchain +21 ([Lawful](/Traits.aspx?ID=99), [Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 2d10+6 slashing plus 2d6 electricity and 1d6 lawful plus [Knockdown](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=20)\r\n\r\n**Divine Innate Spells** DC 28\r\n- **4th**\r\n[Clairaudience](/Spells.aspx?ID=39), [Clairvoyance](/Spells.aspx?ID=40), [Dimensional Anchor](/Spells.aspx?ID=70), [Dispel Magic](/Spells.aspx?ID=78), [Paralyze](/Spells.aspx?ID=213) (×3)\r\n- **5th**\r\n[Locate](/Spells.aspx?ID=173)\r\n- **Constant (6th)**\r\n[True Seeing](/Spells.aspx?ID=344)\r\n\r\n**Rituals** DC 32\r\n\r\n- **3rd**\r\n[Geas](/Rituals.aspx?ID=12)\r\n\r\n**Double Attack** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" />  The zelekhut makes two chain Strikes, each targeting a different creature.
