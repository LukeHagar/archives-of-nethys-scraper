Immune to poison and able to traverse sticky webs thanks to the thick slime that covers their bodies, tixitogs steal food cocooned in spider lairs and prey on spiders themselves, but they are careful never to kill so many that their food supply runs out. Their favorite meal, however, is the odd adventurer or spelunker who stumbles into their nest.\n\n These strange creatures have oblong bodies coated in a viscous and transparent slime, three large black eyes, and eight thick, multi-jointed limbs, four of which are inverted and point upward, allowing the monster to easily crawl on either the ceiling or floor of narrow caverns and squeeze through narrow spaces. Their jaws appear small and tubular when closed but peel apart and stretch to terrifying proportions when opened, as their dozens of pointed teeth part to reveal a freakishly long tongue.\n\n A tixitog usually hides from the spiders in the lair it has claimed, not out of fear but to keep the spiders from abandoning the lair and moving elsewhere. When a tixitog emerges from the shadows, most spiders flee from it rather than attack, and the tixitog uses this behavior to direct entire swarms of spiders where it pleases. This is typically bad news for bands of adventurers who find themselves within a tixitog’s lair; in the mass hysteria caused by a skittering swarm of spiders headed straight toward them, spelunkers typically fail to notice the more dangerous threat that follows closely behind.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Aberration](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11)): DC 20\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 18\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 15\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Tixitog.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 3\">[Tixitog](/Monsters.aspx?ID=438)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Aberration\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=1\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #145: Hellknight Hill](/Sources.aspx?ID=4) pg. 91</row>\n\n**Perception** +9; darkvision, web sense (imprecise) 60 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Aklo](/Languages.aspx?ID=13), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +8, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +10, [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11) +7, [Spider Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +9, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +10\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +3\r\n\r\n**Dex** +3\r\n\r\n**Con** +2\r\n\r\n**Int** +0\r\n\r\n**Wis** +2\r\n\r\n**Cha** -1\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Web Sense** The tixitog can detect the vibrations of creatures touching a web that the tixitog is also touching.\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 19 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +9 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +10 \r\n\r\n**Will** +7 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 40\n\n**Immunities**\r\npoison\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 25 feet, climb 25 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njaws +10,\r\n**Damage** 1d12+5 piercing\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\ntongue +12 ([reach 20 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** tongue pull\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nleg +10 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170)),\r\n**Damage** 1d10+5 bludgeoning\n\n**[Swallow Whole](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=35)** <actions string=\"Single Action\" />  Small, 1d12+3 bludgeoning, Rupture 10\r\n\r\n**Tongue Pull**   When a tixitog hits a Small or smaller creature with its tongue Strike, the target is pulled into the tixitog’s mouth.
