Its hound-like appearance mimics one of humanity's trustiest hunting companions—with a few choice modifications, of course. Few hunting dogs, for example, sport sturdy metal plating and an integrated crossbow bolt launcher.

Shieldmarshals sometimes drop boxes of extra crossbow bolts just inside sewer entrances, enabling clockwork hunters to resupply as needed.\n\n Other businesses that tend to purchase clockwork hunters include warehouses, butchers, and bakers—essentially, anywhere rats and other vermin tend to congregate. Though quick, a clockwork hunter's body isn't very sturdy and tends to fall apart after only minor abuse.
