They are formed of living light given corporeal shape, and they serve as beacons, guiding mortals out of their darkest moments and toward the path of righteousness. Their luminous bodies can flicker with the subtlety of a candle flame or flare up like a torch. Lantern archons can control all aspects of their light as easily as other creatures control their facial expressions, leading them to change color, twinkle, and otherwise dim and brighten in time with their actions and words. While effervescent and chipper in conversation, lantern archons are impressively stoic mobile support troops and guardians in times of conflict, and are capable of uniting to form powerful warriors of light called gestalts.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Celestial](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 15\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 13\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 10\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Archon_LanternArchon.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 1\">[Lantern Archon](/Monsters.aspx?ID=30)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"LG\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Small\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Archon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=13\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Celestial\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=23\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 26</row>\n\n**Perception** +6; darkvision\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Celestial](/Languages.aspx?ID=16), [Draconic](/Languages.aspx?ID=2), [Infernal](/Languages.aspx?ID=19)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +8, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +6, [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13) +6\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** -5\r\n\r\n**Dex** +3\r\n\r\n**Con** +1\r\n\r\n**Int** -1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +1\r\n\r\n**Cha** +1\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 16 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +6 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +10 \r\n\r\n**Will** +4 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 20\n\n**Resistances**\r\n[fire](/Traits.aspx?ID=72) 3\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\nevil 3\r\n\r\n**Retributive Strike** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> A lantern archon can also make a Retributive Strike with its light ray.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** fly 40 feet\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nlight ray +8 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Good](/Traits.aspx?ID=83), [Fire](/Traits.aspx?ID=72), [Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [range 30 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=248)),\r\n**Damage** 1d4 fire plus 1d4 good\r\n\r\n**Divine Innate Spells** DC 17\r\n- **Cantrips (1st)**\r\n[Light](/Spells.aspx?ID=171)\r\n- **1st**\r\n[Detect Alignment](/Spells.aspx?ID=65) (at will; evil only), [Heal](/Spells.aspx?ID=148)\r\n- **4th**\r\n[Read Omens](/Spells.aspx?ID=247)\r\n\r\n**Gestalt** <actions string=\"Three Actions\" /> ([Concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32), [Divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [Transmutation](/Traits.aspx?ID=157)) Nine lantern archons can use this activity, all within 1 round of the first, to merge together to form a composite being for 7 rounds that appears as a glowing warrior of light.
