These angels arise from the souls of stalwart nurturers and protectors, and share a specific connection with a creature's vital essence—its life force. Movanic devas are most concerned with guiding and protecting good creatures during their mortal lives, so once a soul has passed into the River of Souls, the movanic deva leaves its protection to the soul angels, or monadic devas. As part of their stewardship over good creatures, movanic devas can waken within animals a level of sapience to allow them to become kindly and benevolent as well, thus increasing the flow of goodness into the afterlife. They also spend time patrolling the [Positive Energy Plane](/Planes.aspx?ID=3) and [Negative Energy Plane](/Planes.aspx?ID=2), seeking to contain significant threats to life.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Celestial](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 27\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 25\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 22\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Angel_MovanicDeva.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 10\">[Movanic Deva](/Monsters.aspx?ID=542)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"NG\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Angel\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=8\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Celestial\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=23\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 14 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +22; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Celestial](/Languages.aspx?ID=16), [Draconic](/Languages.aspx?ID=2), [Infernal](/Languages.aspx?ID=19); [_tongues_](/Spells.aspx?ID=340)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +20, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +22, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +22, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +22, [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13) +19, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +17, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +17\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +6\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** +4\r\n\r\n**Wis** +5\r\n\r\n**Cha** +5\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n_+1 [striking](/Equipment.aspx?ID=280) [bastard sword](/Weapons.aspx?ID=15)_\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 30 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +21 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +17 \r\n\r\n**Will** +19 \r\n\r\n+1 to all saves vs. magic\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 195\n\n**Immunities**\r\nnegative\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\nevil 10\r\n\r\n**Aura of Vitality** ([abjuration](/Traits.aspx?ID=2), [aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48)) 20 feet.
