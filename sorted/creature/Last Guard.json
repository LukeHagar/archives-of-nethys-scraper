Troop Defenses --- Speed fly 40 feet; troop movement Form Up Single Action The troop chooses one of the squares it currently occupies and redistributes its squares to any configuration in which all squares are contiguous and within 15 feet of the chosen square. The troop can't share its space with other creatures. Frightful Battle Cry Two Actions (Auditory, Divine, Emotion, Enchantment, Fear, Mental, Sonic) The last guards unleash a soul-shaking bellow in unison. All creatures in a 60-foot cone take 7d6 sonic damage (DC 42 basic Will save). Any creature that fails its save is also frightened 3 (or frightened 4 on a critical failure). If the troop occupies 8 or fewer squares, this area decreases to a 30-foot cone. Ghostly Blades Single Action to Three Actions Frequency once per round; Effect The last guards engage in a coordinated attack with their spectral curve blades against each enemy within 5 feet (DC 40 basic Reflex save). The damage depends on the number of actions. Single Action 1d8+2 slashing and 1d8 negative damage Two Actions 2d8+14 slashing and 2d8 negative damage Three Actions 3d8+14 slashing and 3d8 negative damage Spectral Charge Three Actions The last guards charge, swarming through their foes.

Any creature that fails its save is also drained 1 (or drained 2 on a critical failure). The troop can affect each creature only once in a single use of Spectral Charge. Troop Movement Whenever the troop Strides, they first Form Up as a free action to condense into a 20-foot-by-20-foot area (minus any missing squares), then move up to their Speed. This works just like a Gargantuan creature moving. Armies of Legend Last guards are formed under very specific and tragic circumstances.
