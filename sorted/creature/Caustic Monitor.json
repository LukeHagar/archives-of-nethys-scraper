These corrosive fluids originally developed as a means of protection from large insects such as giant mosquitos. The thick layer of mucus that naturally coats the monitors' scaly skin makes it difficult for most other creatures to get too close, let alone prey upon the lizard.\n\n Caustic monitors also use their corrosive biological features to their hunting advantage, particularly by expelling the acidic contents of their stomach at prey. Even when not making use of their acid, caustic monitors can be deadly predators: They grab onto smaller creatures using their powerful forelimb muscles and are remarkably agile, considering their size and weight.\n\n Most caustic monitors live among rocky terrain such as pebble beaches, natural caves, and along sandy river shoals. A caustic monitor's mucus corrodes only flesh, so its den is safe from damage, but corroded plant life near a cave is a telltale sign that a caustic monitor lives nearby. Hardy adventurers and fortune seekers must weigh the potential benefits of hunting this beast—as its acid is highly prized among alchemists—against the obvious risks.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Animal](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 36\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 34\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 31\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Lizard_CausticMonitor.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 13\">[Caustic Monitor](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1398)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Rare\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=137\" />\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Huge\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Animal\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=9\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #166: Despair on Danger Island](/Sources.aspx?ID=85) pg. 86</row>\n\n**Perception** +22; [low-light vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=23), [scent](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=33) (imprecise) 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\n\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +24, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +28, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +20\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +7\r\n\r\n**Dex** +5\r\n\r\n**Con** +5\r\n\r\n**Int** -4\r\n\r\n**Wis** +4\r\n\r\n**Cha** -2\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 34 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +24 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +23 \r\n\r\n**Will** +20 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 235\n\n**Corrosive Flesh** A creature that touches the caustic monitor takes 2d8 acid damage (DC 32 [basic](/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Fortitude save).<br />**Gnashing Grip** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> **Trigger** A creature grabbed by the caustic monitor's jaws fails a check to [Escape](/Actions.aspx?ID=79); **Effect** The caustic monitor's jaws deal 2d8 piercing damage and the triggering creature is exposed to caustic monitor venom.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 40 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njaws +27 ([reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 2d10+9 piercing plus 2d8 acid, [Improved Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=27), and caustic monitor venom\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\ntalon +27,\r\n**Damage** 2d8+13 slashing plus 2d6 [persistent bleed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=29)\n\n**Caustic Spray** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([Acid](/Traits.aspx?ID=3)) The caustic monitor spits a spray of corrosive bile that deals 5d8 acid damage in a 20-foot cone (DC 32 [basic](/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Reflex save).
