These might be the faithful haunting symbols of their faith, warriors clinging to their old weapons, or the greedy inhabiting their precious wealth. These spirits' physical bodies have long since degraded, but they keep their corrupted relics pristine. The spirits manifest on the unsuspecting or curious, determined to destroy anyone who would dare show any interest in their one precious possession.\n\n Though rare, there are several kinds of corrupted relics. The bound spirit can manifest in different ways, from animating an ancient weapon to possessing anyone who dons the item. Destroying the relic often ends up being the simplest, most direct way to banish the haunt itself. Destroying or dispelling the spirit without destroying the relic, however, can sometimes leave priceless treasure behind.\n\n The amulet shown here has the [air](/equipment/relics) and [death](/equipment/relics) aspects. Its minor gifts, [deadly spark](/Relics.aspx?ID=1) and [death gaze](/Relics.aspx?ID=19), power some of the spirit's abilities.
