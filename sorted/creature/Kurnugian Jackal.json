When that jackal bears a litter, one pup is born with a third eye in the center of its forehead. If the pup can survive to maturity, this jackal gains superior intelligence and psychic abilities, becoming a full-fledged Kurnugian jackal, so named after the Mother of Monsters' [Abyssal](/Planes.aspx?ID=13) realm. With increased cleverness comes an appetite to sow chaos in the name of Lamashtu. When a Kurnugian jackal reaches the pinnacle of their power, they appear twice as large as a regular jackal and far more cunning.\n\n A Kurnugian jackal enjoys stalking the outskirts of settlements, looking for lone individuals they can ambush. Once they spot their prey, they open their third eye to hypnotize and lure their target in. Often, a Kurnugian jackal leads victims into the wilderness and then releases their hold, leaving the victims lost with no memory of how they got there. Most succumb to exposure or the dangers of local wildlife as the jackal looks on gleefully. They seem to gain sustenance from their victims' predicament but also feast on the deceased victims' flesh. If their prey reaches safety, the Kurnugian jackal repeats the process on subsequent nights.\n\n Some Kurnugian jackals are adopted as objects of worship by Lamashtan cults, and others gather followers on their own. Their resemblance to Lamashtu's religious symbol affords them a great deal of reverence, and they sometimes claim to speak directly for the Mother of Monsters. A cult with a Kurnugian jackal often acts more boldly than one without.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Beast](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2), [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 24\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 22\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 19\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 6\">[Kurnugian Jackal](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1024)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"CE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Beast\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=20\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Troubles in Otari](/Sources.aspx?ID=55) pg. 61</row>\n\n**Perception** +17; [low-light vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=23), [scent](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=33) (imprecise) 60 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Abyssal](/Languages.aspx?ID=12), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +18, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +11, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +13, [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11) +11, [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13) +13, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +18\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +4\r\n\r\n**Dex** +5\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** +1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** +0\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 23 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +14 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +17 \r\n\r\n**Will** +11 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 98\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\n[cold iron](/Equipment.aspx?ID=375) 5\r\n\r\n**Inflict Pain** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> ([concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=163)) When a target affected by the Kurnugian jackal's Hypnotic Stare ability takes damage, the jackal can focus the power of their third eye to intensify the pain of this damage, increasing the damage dealt by 1d6.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 35 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njaws +15 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170)),\r\n**Damage** 2d6+5 piercing plus [Knockdown](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=20)\r\n\r\n**Divine Innate Spells** DC 21\r\n- **1st**\r\n[Charm](/Spells.aspx?ID=34), [Grim Tendrils](/Spells.aspx?ID=141)\r\n- **2nd**\r\n[Hideous Laughter](/Spells.aspx?ID=150), [See Invisibility](/Spells.aspx?ID=271)\r\n- **3rd**\r\n[Paralyze](/Spells.aspx?ID=213)\r\n\r\n**Hypnotic Stare** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([Concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32), [Divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [Mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [Visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=163)) The Kurnugian jackal opens their third eye to look at a target within 30 feet that can see the jackal.
