Powerful spellcasters can draw them from the [Dimension of Time](/Planes.aspx?ID=21) via rare rituals, but doing so attracts the hounds' ire, so few who traffic in such rituals live long enough to spread their knowledge. While the hounds possess great cunning and cruel intellect, they rarely interact with other creatures—other than to hunt and destroy those who have attracted their unblinking attention.\n\n Once a hound catches scent of a mortal to hunt, it calls others of its ilk. The pack then pursues its victim through all space and time until it catches, slays and devours them. Those pursued can escape only by avoiding all angles, as hounds of Tindalos could step through them from nothingness at any time.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Aberration](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11)): DC 28\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 26\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 23\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/HoundOfTindalos.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 7\">[Hound of Tindalos](/Monsters.aspx?ID=702)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Rare\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=137\" />\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Aberration\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=1\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Time\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=313\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 146 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +17; [greater darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Aklo](/Languages.aspx?ID=13)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +17, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +15, [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11) +17, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +17, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +13\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +4\r\n\r\n**Dex** +6\r\n\r\n**Con** +2\r\n\r\n**Int** +6\r\n\r\n**Wis** +4\r\n\r\n**Cha** +2\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 25 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +13 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +17 \r\n\r\n**Will** +15 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 90\n\n**Immunities**\r\n[controlled](/Conditions.aspx?ID=6), [emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60)\r\n\r\n**Resistances**\r\nmental 10, poison 10, physical 10\n\n**Otherworldly Mind** ([mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) Whenever a creature targets the hound with a [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106) effect, that creature takes 4d6 mental damage (DC 25 basic Will save).
