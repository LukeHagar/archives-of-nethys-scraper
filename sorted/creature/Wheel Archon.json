Wheel archons often serve as messengers or harbingers for the armies of heaven, as their stubborn, indomitable natures make them ill-suited for missions requiring diplomacy or tact. Indeed, they have a legendary intolerance and single-mindedness in the pursuit of the punishment of evil.\n\n Wheel archons can't tolerate deceit and easily see through lies. The sensation of this celestial being's divine eyes all fixing upon a single target is usually enough to encourage honesty, but when a wheel archon detects a falsehood, their righteous wrath takes over and they mete out punishment to sinners without quarter.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Celestial](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 40\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 38\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 35\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/WheelArchon.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 16\">[Wheel Archon](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2079)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Rare\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=137\" />\r\n<trait label=\"LG\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Huge\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Archon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=13\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Celestial\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=23\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #183: Field of Maidens](/Sources.aspx?ID=145) pg. 82</row>\n\n**Perception** +28; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), [_discern lies_](/Spells.aspx?ID=74), [_true seeing_](/Spells.aspx?ID=344)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Celestial](/Languages.aspx?ID=16), [Draconic](/Languages.aspx?ID=2), [Infernal](/Languages.aspx?ID=19); [_tongues_](/Spells.aspx?ID=340)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +31, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +30, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +29, [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13) +28, [Warfare Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +29\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +6\r\n\r\n**Dex** +9\r\n\r\n**Con** +6\r\n\r\n**Int** +5\r\n\r\n**Wis** +6\r\n\r\n**Cha** +3\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 41 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +26 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +31 \r\n\r\n**Will** +28 \r\n\r\n+1 status to all saves vs. [magic](/Traits.aspx?ID=103)\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 230\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\nevil 15\r\n\r\n**All-Knowing Eyes** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [divination](/Traits.aspx?ID=47), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=163)) 30 feet.
