While Burrowing, if Somnalu would move through a space occupied by another creature, that creature must attempt a DC 36 Reflex save to avoid falling into the trench and taking the acid damage.

On a success, Somnalu drains the creature's life through its skin. The creature must succeed at a DC 36 Fortitude save or become [drained 2](/Conditions.aspx?ID=10) (drained 1 on a success, no effect on a critical success). Somnalu gains temporary Hit Points equal to the amount of Hit Points the creature loses from this Strike.\r\n\r\n**Vent Fumes** <actions string=\"Three Actions\" />  Somnalu blasts poison gas in a 30-foot radius. The gas lingers for 1 round, and all creatures that begin their turn in the gas or enter the gas take 4d8 poison damage (DC 36 [basic](/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Fortitude save). Any creature in the gas is [concealed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=4), and other creatures are concealed to all creatures in the gas.
