They disguise themselves as massive dunes before rising up to attack living creatures. The most infamous zaramuuns kill any living creatures they find, but others simply rob their victims of all metal and stone possessions before fleeing. Although zaramuuns insist they are only reclaiming what was taken from their ancestral earth, this is simple self-delusion; most zaramuuns use their stolen goods as payment and material components to conjure fiends, for Zaramuuns were exiled from the Plane of Earth after worshipping fiends who promised to give them power over other elementals. This worship gradually transformed into servitude, and now many zaramuuns believe that if they send enough souls to their masters, they will be set free.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Elemental](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2), [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 35\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 33\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 30\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Zaramuun.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 16\">[Zaramuun](/Monsters.aspx?ID=422)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"CE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Earth\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=55\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Elemental\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=57\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 339</row>\n\n**Perception** +30; darkvision, tremorsense 60 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Abyssal](/Languages.aspx?ID=12), [Terran](/Languages.aspx?ID=22)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +31, [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13) +26, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +27\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +9\r\n\r\n**Dex** +5\r\n\r\n**Con** +6\r\n\r\n**Int** +0\r\n\r\n**Wis** +5\r\n\r\n**Cha** -1\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 39 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +34 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +30 \r\n\r\n**Will** +25 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 291\n\n**Immunities**\r\nparalyzed, poison, sleep\n\n**Attack of Opportunity** <actions string=\"Reaction\" />\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 35 feet, burrow 35 feet; sand glide\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nfist +33,\r\n**Damage** 4d12+13 bludgeoning\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nrock or metal debris +29 ([range increment 120 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=248)),\r\n**Damage** 4d8+13 bludgeoning\r\n\r\n**Divine Innate Spells** DC 37, attack +31\r\n- **4th**\r\n[Suggestion](/Spells.aspx?ID=315) (at will)\r\n- **6th**\r\n[Disintegrate](/Spells.aspx?ID=76), [Spirit Blast](/Spells.aspx?ID=301)\r\n- **8th**\r\n[Dimensional Anchor](/Spells.aspx?ID=70) (at will)\r\n- **Constant (8th)**\r\n[Dimensional Anchor](/Spells.aspx?ID=70)\r\n\r\n**Divine Rituals** DC 37\r\n\r\n- **5th**\r\n[Planar Ally](/Rituals.aspx?ID=16)\r\n\r\n**Dune** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([Concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32)) Until the next time it acts, the zaramuun appears to be a sand dune.
