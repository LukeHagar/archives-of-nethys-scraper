On a trip to deliver relics there, two Ekujae lore-bearers brought their daughter, Ekene. After concluding their business, they told Ekene that she was to stay and learn. Her first lonely night in the dormitory was also the first time the serious young elf ever wept.\n\n Ekene spent her youth training to be one of the Ekujae's defenders. She believed the warrior's road was her life's path, not that of a scholar. She works hard at her studies to make her parents proud, even though she still doesn't feel like she belongs. Ekene's traditional Ekujae paint markings have faded since her arrival and she has intentionally chosen not to reapply them. She hopes to have her family apply new markings upon her return that better represent the person she will become upon leaving the Magaambya, whether or not it's who they expect her to be.\n\n Ekene is generally amiable, but is particularly close with Muruwa, as the two share a love for climbing trees and spending time outdoors.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 25\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 23\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 20\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 1\">[Ekene](/NPCs.aspx?ID=1750)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Unique\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=161\" />\r\n<trait label=\"LG\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Elf\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=58\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Threshold of Knowledge](/Sources.aspx?ID=109) pg. 11</row>\n\n**Perception** +4; [low-light vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=23)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Elven](/Languages.aspx?ID=4), [Mwangi](/Languages.aspx?ID=39)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +7, [Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2) +4, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +6, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +4, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +7, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +4, [Warfare Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +4\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +3\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +0\r\n\r\n**Int** +1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +1\r\n\r\n**Cha** +0\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n[lesser alchemist's fire](/Equipment.aspx?ID=75) (2), [Backpack](/Equipment.aspx?ID=4), [Chalk](/Equipment.aspx?ID=12) (10), [Dagger](/Weapons.aspx?ID=3) (2), [minor elixir of life](/Equipment.aspx?ID=91) (2), [Rope](/Equipment.aspx?ID=44), [Writing Set](/Equipment.aspx?ID=63), 9 sp\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 19 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +5 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +9 \r\n\r\n**Will** +6 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 16\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nfist +7 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179), [Nonlethal](/Traits.aspx?ID=188), [Unarmed](/Traits.aspx?ID=199)),\r\n**Damage** 1d6+3 bludgeoning\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\ncrane wing +7 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179), [Nonlethal](/Traits.aspx?ID=188), [Unarmed](/Traits.aspx?ID=199)),\r\n**Damage** 1d6+3 bludgeoning\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\ndagger +7 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179), [versatile S](/Traits.aspx?ID=200)),\r\n**Damage** 1d4+3 piercing\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nbomb +4 ([thrown 20 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=195)),\r\n**Damage** varies\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\ndagger +7 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [thrown 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=195), [versatile S](/Traits.aspx?ID=200)),\r\n**Damage** 1d4+3 piercing\r\n\r\n**Arcane Innate Spells** DC 13\r\n- **Cantrips (1st)**\r\n[Detect Magic](/Spells.aspx?ID=66), [Shield](/Spells.aspx?ID=280)\r\n\r\n**Crane Stance** <actions string=\"Single Action\" />  **Requirements** Ekene is unarmored; **Effect** Ekene enters the stance of a crane, holding her arms in an imitation of a crane's wings and using flowing, defensive motions.
