He has natural charm and good looks and fully expects to become an ambassador for his people when he's older. He considers his education at the Magaambya to be a pleasant dalliance, and he spends most his time with the friends he's made there. Zane is an intelligent young man with something of a lazy streak, simply putting in the necessary work to get by.\n\n When Zane was a toddler, his parents gave him to local priests for a blessing in a local river. Playful water spirits took notice of the baby and stole him from the inattentive priests. Zane's parents believed he'd been drowned and lost. A year and a day after Zane disappeared, he washed back up on the banks of the river and was reunited with his relieved but puzzled family. Since then, Zane has felt the stirring of fey magic within him, but his family insisted on putting the disappearance firmly in the past and moving on. Zane's budding powers frightened his family, so he learned to keep them hidden, something he no longer has to do since his enrollment in the Magaambya.\n\n Due to his charm, Zane is quick to make friends, but he's found he has the most in common with Ekene. The two both know how it feels to be misunderstood and understand the heavy weight of the expectations placed upon them by their families and communities.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 25\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 23\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 20\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 1\">[Zane Ikundi](/NPCs.aspx?ID=1754)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Unique\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=161\" />\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Half-Orc\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=86\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Human\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=90\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Orc\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=124\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Threshold of Knowledge](/Sources.aspx?ID=109) pg. 15</row>\n\n**Perception** +3; low-light vision\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Mwangi](/Languages.aspx?ID=39), [Sylvan](/Languages.aspx?ID=10)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2) +5, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +7, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +7, [Genealogy Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +5, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +3, [Performance](/Skills.aspx?ID=12) +7, [Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14) +5\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +0\r\n\r\n**Dex** +2\r\n\r\n**Con** +1\r\n\r\n**Int** +2\r\n\r\n**Wis** +0\r\n\r\n**Cha** +4\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n[Backpack](/Equipment.aspx?ID=4), [lesser bottled lightning](/Equipment.aspx?ID=76), [Dagger](/Weapons.aspx?ID=3), [minor elixir of life](/Equipment.aspx?ID=91) (3), [Mirror](/Equipment.aspx?ID=35), [Writing Set](/Equipment.aspx?ID=63), 7 sp\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 15 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +4 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +5 \r\n\r\n**Will** +5 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 15\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 25 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\ndagger +3 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179), [versatile S](/Traits.aspx?ID=200)),\r\n**Damage** 1d4 piercing\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nbomb +2 ([thrown 20 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=195)),\r\n**Damage** varies\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\ndagger +5 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [thrown 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=195), [versatile S](/Traits.aspx?ID=200)),\r\n**Damage** 1d4 piercing\r\n\r\n**Primal Spontaneous Spells** DC 17, attack +7\r\n- **Cantrips (1st)**\r\n[Electric Arc](/Spells.aspx?ID=97), [Detect Magic](/Spells.aspx?ID=66), [Ghost Sound](/Spells.aspx?ID=132), [Prestidigitation](/Spells.aspx?ID=229), [Produce Flame](/Spells.aspx?ID=236)\r\n- **1st**\r\n[Charm](/Spells.aspx?ID=34), [Gritty Wheeze](/Spells.aspx?ID=1092), [Nettleskin](/Spells.aspx?ID=1093) (3 slots)\r\n\r\n**Sorcerer Bloodline Spells** DC 17, 1 Focus Point\r\n- **1st**\r\n[Faerie Dust](/Spells.aspx?ID=508)\r\n\r\n**Dangerous Sorcery**   When Zane Casts a Spell from his spell slots, if the spell deals damage and doesn't have a duration, he gain a status bonus to that spell's damage equal to the spell's level.\r\n\r\n**Ancestry Feat**   [Natural Ambition](/Feats.aspx?ID=70)\r\n\r\n**Class Feat**   [Dangerous Sorcery](/Feats.aspx?ID=603)\r\n\r\n**Skill Feats**   [Courtly Graces](/Feats.aspx?ID=772)\r\n\r\n</column>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"creature-family-298\" />",
