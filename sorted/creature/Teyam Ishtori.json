Each eye contains an 8th-level spell that targets one creature (usually one eye has [_maze_](/Spells.aspx?ID=187) and the other [_polar ray_](/Spells.aspx?ID=224)). The demilich can Activate an eye. This uses the number of spellcasting actions the spell requires, and also requires command and envision components. When the demilich casts a spell from a gemstone eye, that eye stops glowing for 1d4 rounds, during which time that eye's spell can't be used. Occasionally, one or both of the two demilich eye gems can be harvested from a destroyed demilich as [magic items](/Equipment.aspx?ID=489).\r\n\r\n**Devour Soul** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([Arcane](/Traits.aspx?ID=11), [Necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117), [Negative](/Traits.aspx?ID=118)) **Requirements** A soul has been trapped in one of the demilich's blight quartz gems (see Trap Soul) for 24 hours. **Effect** The demilich consumes the soul. The soul is utterly destroyed, and the demilich regains HP equal to double the creature's level.\r\n\r\n**Mental Magic**   A demilich can replace all material and somatic components for casting spells with verbal components, and can replace all Interact components for activating magic items with envision components.\r\n\r\n**Staff Gems**   A demilich long ago absorbed the spells from a staff into gemstone nodules embedded in its skull, with larger nodules representing higher-level spells. It can cast any of the spells as though it were Activating the staff, and regains 1 charge per 4 hours spent in torpor, to a maximum of 10 charges. <br />Teyam Ishtori has the spells from a [_staff of power_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=361).\r\n\r\n**Trap Soul**   <actions string=\"Single Action\" />; command **Frequency** once per day per gem; **Effect** Ten blight quartz gemstones on the demilich's skull can trap the souls of the living. The Activated gem casts [_bind soul_](/Spells.aspx?ID=21). This _bind soul_ can target and affect a [dying](/Conditions.aspx?ID=11) creature instead of a corpse. The dying creature can attempt a DC 43 Fortitude save; if it succeeds, it doesn't die and its soul is not trapped but it's enervated 2 (or is unaffected entirely on a critical success). When the soul of a creature gets trapped, the creature's body swiftly turns to dust.<br /> The gemstones work like the black sapphires used in _bind soul_, except that they can hold creatures of up to 17th level and have a value of 200 gp apiece. The demilich can Devour a Soul it has trapped.\r\n\r\n</column>",
