Unlike most giants, cloud giants are quite morally diverse. A handful are neutral, but of the others, roughly half are good, while the other half are evil. Good cloud giants are often civic-minded builders of roads and settlements, and are interested in trading goods as well as cultural innovations. It’s not uncommon for such giants to approach their neighbors with diplomacy and build strong relationships with other peaceful peoples. Conversely, evil cloud giants are often isolationist and xenophobic. Preferring hidden mountain valleys and settlements in the caves and among the crags of lonely peaks, they raid for what they want and treat other creatures like inconsequential insects. These opposing philosophies can generate a great deal of strife among neighboring cloud giant communities, and the raiders often threaten the trade deals of their peaceful cousins.\n\n Legends persist of floating cities ruled by magically gifted cloud giant queens and kings.
