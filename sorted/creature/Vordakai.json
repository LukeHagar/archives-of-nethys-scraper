When this [cyclops](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=25) tyrant was defeated during the chaos following Earthfall, one of his apprentices claimed his name as well as his greatest treasure, the [_Oculus of Abaddon_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=1747). Though he had been the least of the necromancer's apprentices, the new Vordakai was nevertheless a powerful wizard, but it would take more than power to claim the true Vordakai's mantle. Betrayed by followers of the original leader who refused to serve him, the new Vordakai was sealed into his own tomb, and over the passage of eons, the cyclops [lich](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=68) atrophied.\n\n Although much weakened today, Vordakai remains a dangerous opponent who can devastate a poorly prepared party on his own. Don't be afraid to play Vordakai as arrogant creature—he has existed for longer than most creatures on Golarion, after all, and if he makes arrogant mistakes (such as neglecting to cast spells defensively or provoking [Attacks of Opportunity](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=3)), that not only gives the PCs a chance to survive but also helps to establish the ancient lich as both overconfident and a bit careless from his long period of quiescence. Keep in mind that Vordakai is the most powerful foe the PCs have encountered in the _Kingmaker Adventure Path_ thus far, and in defeating him, they will accomplish something truly legendary.\n\n If Vordakai has the chance to prepare for battle before combat, he takes 3 rounds to cast [_tongues_](/Spells.aspx?ID=340), [_resist energy_](/Spells.aspx?ID=256) (choosing an energy type he knows the PCs favor as a result of watching them via his familiar), and then [_mirror image_](/Spells.aspx?ID=197) just before entering battle. Finally, he activates [_true seeing_](/Spells.aspx?ID=344) using the _Oculus of Abaddon_ before entering combat (doing so in the first round of a fight if instead he's caught by surprise by the PCs).\n\n Once combat begins, Vordakai starts by casting [_dominate_](/Spells.aspx?ID=87) on the party's strongest healer; if successful, he commands the healer to his side to defend him by attacking anyone who attacks the lich in melee. On subsequent rounds, Vordakai uses ranged magic against the party, casting [_vampiric exsanguination_](/Spells.aspx?ID=353) as soon as he's reduced to 100 Hit Points or fewer. When facing only one or two foes, he prefers to attack with Consume Memories followed by a hand Strike, opting to save his spells for an emergency.\n\n The greatest diminishment of Vordakai's power is represented through the loss of his [_soul cage_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=1545)—the magical item he initially used to trap his own soul and enable his transformation into a lich in the first place. He cannot create a replacement as long as he remains atrophied, but his arrogance works against him here. Only if he's reduced below 20 Hit Points does he realize that the PCs have a very good chance to defeat him, and if he survives long enough to take a turn after this realization, he casts his 5th-level [_dimension door_](/Spells.aspx?ID=69) to flee to area C5 of his tomb. If he's able to escape in this way, he'll wait for a few days before returning to his tomb, infuriated if the PCs have released his prisoners and robbed him blind. At this point, Vordakai can become a recurring villain in your campaign!\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Undead](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 40\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 38\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 35\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Vordakai.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 12\">[Vordakai](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2200)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Unique\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=161\" />\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Undead\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=160\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Kingmaker Adventure Path](/Sources.aspx?ID=150) pg. 606</row>\n\n**Perception** +23; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), [_true seeing_](/Spells.aspx?ID=344)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Cyclops](/Languages.aspx?ID=30), [Daemonic](/Languages.aspx?ID=31), [Jotun](/Languages.aspx?ID=8), [Necril](/Languages.aspx?ID=20)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Abaddon Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +27, [Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +20, [Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2) +25, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +21, [Crafting](/Skills.aspx?ID=4) +23, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +21, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +21, [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11) +25, [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13) +25\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +5\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +5\r\n\r\n**Int** +7\r\n\r\n**Wis** +5\r\n\r\n**Cha** +5\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n[_Oculus of Abaddon_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=1747), spellbook\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 33 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +23 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +20 \r\n\r\n**Will** +25 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 200\r\n([negative healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=42))\n\n**Immunities**\r\n[death](/Traits.aspx?ID=40) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126), [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38)\r\n\r\n**Resistances**\r\n[cold](/Traits.aspx?ID=27) 10, physical 10 (except [magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103) bludgeoning)\n\n**Atrophied Lich** Sometimes, a lich that remains immobile and insensible for extended periods of time—as Vordakai did after he was imprisoned in his tomb just prior to Earthfall 10,000 years ago—can become atrophied.
