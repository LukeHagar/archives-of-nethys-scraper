They're known to eat giant rats, then take over the rats' burrows as homes. Giant toads have large poison glands behind their eyes that enable them to coat their skin with poison. This leads to them having very few natural predators, and populations can quickly explode if left unchecked. While most consider giant toads dangerous pests, some groups of [ogres](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=78) and [hill giants](/Monsters.aspx?ID=220) cultivate them to collect their poison for recreational use.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Animal](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 16\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 14\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 11\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Toad_GiantToad.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 2\">[Giant Toad](/Monsters.aspx?ID=828)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Animal\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=9\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 261 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +8; [low-light vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=23), [scent (imprecise) 30 feet](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=33)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\n\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +9, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +6\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +5\r\n\r\n**Dex** +2\r\n\r\n**Con** +3\r\n\r\n**Int** -4\r\n\r\n**Wis** +2\r\n\r\n**Cha** -2\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 17 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +9 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +8 \r\n\r\n**Will** +6 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 36\n\n**Poisonous Warts** Any creature that hits the giant toad with an unarmed Strike or otherwise touches the toad is exposed to giant toad poison.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 25 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nbite +11,\r\n**Damage** 1d8+5 piercing plus [Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=18)\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\ntongue +11 ([reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** tongue grab\n\n**Giant Toad Poison**  ([Poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126)) **Saving Throw** DC 19 Fortitude; **Maximum Duration** 6 rounds; **Stage 1** [stupefied 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=37) (1 round); **Stage 2** stupefied 1 and [confused](/Conditions.aspx?ID=5) (1 round)\r\n\r\n**[Swallow Whole](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=35)** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([Attack](/Traits.aspx?ID=15)) Medium, 1d8+2 bludgeoning, Rupture 8\r\n\r\n**Tongue Grab**   A creature hit by the giant toad's tongue becomes [grabbed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=20) by the giant toad.
