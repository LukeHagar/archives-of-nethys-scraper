These skelms bully and exploit the souls of the dead, binding souls and undead to keep themselves indefinitely young. They bully living victims as well, stoking regret and shame even from inconsequential minutiae or outright fabrications until these feelings become unbreakable ties that the skelm can leverage from beyond the grave. A soul skelm's attentions can leave a victim isolated from friends and allies, making them all the more susceptible to the skelm's manipulations.\n\n Ambitious soul skelms—often those who arise from [palace skelms](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1303)—search out powerful, high-strung mortals and trick them into bringing ridicule or shame on themselves. After their victim's death, the skelms gleefully remind them of their mortal failings, feeding on their despair.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Fiend](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 27\r\n\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 27\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 25\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 22\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Skelm_SoulSkelm.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 10\">[Soul Skelm](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1304)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"LE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fiend\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=70\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Skelm\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=364\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 3](/Sources.aspx?ID=66) pg. 241</row>\n\n**Perception** +19; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), [scent](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=33) (imprecise) 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Aklo](/Languages.aspx?ID=13), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +22, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +21, [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11) +19, [Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14) +19, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +17\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +6\r\n\r\n**Dex** +3\r\n\r\n**Con** +5\r\n\r\n**Int** +3\r\n\r\n**Wis** +5\r\n\r\n**Cha** +7\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n_+1 [striking](/Equipment.aspx?ID=280) [ghost touch](/Equipment.aspx?ID=297) [spiked chain](/Weapons.aspx?ID=60)_\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 29 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +19 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +17 \r\n\r\n**Will** +21 \r\n\r\n–2 to all saves vs. [emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60) effects\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 170\n\n**Immunities**\r\n[possession](/Traits.aspx?ID=129)\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\n[cold iron](/Equipment.aspx?ID=272) 10\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nfist +22 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Evil](/Traits.aspx?ID=64), [Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103)),\r\n**Damage** 2d8+12 bludgeoning plus [Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=18)\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nantler +22 ([Evil](/Traits.aspx?ID=64), [Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103)),\r\n**Damage** 2d12+12 piercing plus [Knockdown](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=20)\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\n_spiked chain_ +23 ([Disarm](/Traits.aspx?ID=175), [Evil](/Traits.aspx?ID=64), [Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [Trip](/Traits.aspx?ID=196)),\r\n**Damage** 2d8+12 slashing plus [Knockdown](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=20)\r\n\r\n**Occult Innate Spells** DC 29\r\n- **2nd**\r\n[Invisibility](/Spells.aspx?ID=164) (at will), [Silence](/Spells.aspx?ID=287) (at will)\r\n- **4th**\r\n[Dimension Door](/Spells.aspx?ID=69) (at will)\r\n- **5th**\r\n[Harm](/Spells.aspx?ID=146), [Illusory Creature](/Spells.aspx?ID=158), [Mind Probe](/Spells.aspx?ID=193), [Modify Memory](/Spells.aspx?ID=200)\r\n- **7th**\r\n[Plane Shift](/Spells.aspx?ID=222) (self only; [Astral](/Planes.aspx?ID=8) or [Material Plane](/Planes.aspx?ID=1) only)\r\n\r\n**Bully the Departed** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([Auditory](/Traits.aspx?ID=16), [Emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [Mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [Occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120), [Enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61)) The skelm draws upon the spirit of one of his deceased victims, tormenting their soul beyond the grave.
