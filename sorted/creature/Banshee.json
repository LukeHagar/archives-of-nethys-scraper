Some banshees arise from elves who were slain by trusted friends and allies, or whose loved ones betrayed them on their deathbeds. Others spawn from elves whose treacherous deeds shortly before their deaths left a stain upon their souls. Regardless of their origin, banshees despise the living. This hatred of life is all too often a horrific inversion of their personalities in life. Some speculate that the more kind-hearted the elf (and the more wrenching the betrayal), the crueler the banshee.\n\n Banshees rarely stray far from where they perished and typically haunt thick forests and canopied swamps where little light graces the ground. Many banshees can be found in the elven nation of Kyonin, specifically in Tanglebriar, the sinister domain of the demon Treerazer. Similarly, a large number of banshees can be found lurking about the edges of drow settlements in the Darklands, as plenty of cruelty and betrayal exists in drow culture.\n\n Banshees’ mere touch inflicts pain and primal fear, and those exposed to their wails of grief rarely survive the experience.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Spirit](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11)): DC 38\r\n\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Undead](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 38\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 36\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 33\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Banshee.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 17\">[Banshee](/Monsters.aspx?ID=39)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"CE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Incorporeal\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=222\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Spirit\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=149\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Undead\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=160\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 34</row>\n\n**Perception** +32; hears heartbeats (imprecise) 60 feet, darkvision\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Elven](/Languages.aspx?ID=4)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +31, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +32, [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11) +25\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** -5\r\n\r\n**Dex** +6\r\n\r\n**Con** +2\r\n\r\n**Int** +0\r\n\r\n**Wis** +7\r\n\r\n**Cha** +7\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Hears Heartbeats** The banshee can hear heartbeats within 60 feet (imprecise).<br /> **Sunlight Powerlessness** If in direct sunlight, the banshee is slowed 1 and can’t use actions that have the attack trait.\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 39 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +25 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +29 \r\n\r\n**Will** +32 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 250\r\n([negative healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=42))\n\n**Immunities**\r\n[disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126), precision, [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38)\n\n**Resistances**\r\nall damage 12 (except [force](/Traits.aspx?ID=75), [_ghost touch_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=297), or [positive](/Traits.aspx?ID=128); double resistance vs. non-[magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103))\n\n**Vengeful Spite** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> ([evocation](/Traits.aspx?ID=65), [occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120)); **Trigger** A foe critically hits the banshee, or the banshee critically fails their save against a foe’s damaging effect. **Effect** The banshee lashes back at their tormentor, dealing 4d10+14 mental damage (DC 38 basic Will save) and applying the effects of terrifying touch based on the results of the same Will save.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** fly 60 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nhand +32 ([Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179), [Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103)),\r\n**Damage** 4d10+14 negative plus terrifying touch\n\n**Spectral Ripple**   When a banshee Strides at least 10 feet, they’re concealed until the start of their next turn.\r\n\r\n**Terrifying Touch**  ([Emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [Enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61), [Fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=68), [Occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120)) A creature damaged by the banshee’s touch that isn’t already [frightened](/Conditions.aspx?ID=19) must attempt a DC 38 Will save (DC 43 if the attack was a critical hit).
