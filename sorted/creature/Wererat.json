Because wererats typically dwell in metropolitan areas where they can hide in plain sight, practically any city-goer could be a wererat in disguise—from the quiet shopkeep to the city’s criminal mastermind. The bustle of crowds and countless rat-holes make ghettos and shantytowns favored homes for wererats, especially since in these poorer districts the wererat can kill out of greed or fear with little chance of the authorities noticing. In some cities, wererats operate entire thieves’ guilds or organized crime rings, and membership requires willfully submitting to the wererat’s cursed bite. Wererats look very similar to ratfolk when in hybrid form, apart from potential differences in size, but ratfolk have no love for these monsters.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Beast](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2), [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 16\r\n\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 16\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 14\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 11\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Werecreature_Wererat.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 2\">[Wererat](/Monsters.aspx?ID=410)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"LE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Beast\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=20\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Human\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=90\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Werecreature\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=243\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 329</row>\n\n**Perception** +8; low-light vision, scent (imprecise) 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1); rat empathy\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +8, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +6, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +5, [Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14) +4, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +8\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +2\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +2\r\n\r\n**Int** +0\r\n\r\n**Wis** +2\r\n\r\n**Cha** +1\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Rat Empathy** ([divination](/Traits.aspx?ID=47), [primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=134)) The wererat can communicate with rodents.\r\n\r\n**Items**\r\n[Leather Armor](/Armor.aspx?ID=4), [Hand Crossbow](/Weapons.aspx?ID=69) (20 bolts)\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 19 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +6 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +10 \r\n\r\n**Will** +8 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 45\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\nsilver 5\r\n\r\n**Nimble Dodge** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> **Trigger** The wererat is targeted with a melee or ranged attack by an attacker it can see. **Effect** The wererat gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against the triggering attack.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 25 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nshortsword +10 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179), [versatile S](/Traits.aspx?ID=200)),\r\n**Damage** 1d6+4 piercing\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nclaw +10 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179)),\r\n**Damage** 1d6+2 slashing\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njaws +10 ([Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179)),\r\n**Damage** 1d8+2 piercing plus curse of the wererat\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nhand crossbow +10 ([range increment 60 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=248), [reload 1](/Traits.aspx?ID=254)),\r\n**Damage** 1d6 piercing\n\n**[Change Shape](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=8)** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([Concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32), [Polymorph](/Traits.aspx?ID=127), [Primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=134), [Transmutation](/Traits.aspx?ID=157)) Human with fist +10 for 1d4+2 bludgeoning, or Small rat with Speed 30 feet, climb 10 feet.\r\n\r\n**Curse of the Wererat**  ([Curse](/Traits.aspx?ID=38), [Necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117), [Primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=134)) This curse affects only humanoids. **Saving Throw** DC 18 Fortitude save.
