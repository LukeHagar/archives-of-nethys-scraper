Animated by loneliness, the embittered spirit binds itself to the material world in a body made of bits and oddments of a lost childhood—wooden blocks, scraps of blankets, ratty dolls, buttons, carved trinkets, and glass marbles.

When they sense the living, attic whisperers attempt to lure them into their clutches by calling out to them using the voice of a small child.
