Plot Hooks Game Masters might consider the following plot hooks as a means of integrating Eleukas into any Pathfinder Second Edition game. Eleukas needs help recovering an escaped prisoner who has made threats on the lives of a local family The heroes must defeat a marauding creature that can only be permanently killed by acid damage. Eleukas falls victim to some charm or possession effect and the heroes must stop him without killing him. While the heroes are investigating strange happenings in Otari, Eleukas lends his aid as someone who can make introductions to helpful townspeople and perhaps even convince Captain Longsaddle to overlook well-intentioned misdemeanors.
