The hilly island bears several ruins of the Ghol-Gan empire, the culture that represented the greatness of the cyclopes in an age long since perished. It was while lying in the crumbling hall of one of these ruins one night that Halbrux had the vision that changed her life.\n\n Halbrux had always been something of an outcast in her family. She didn't experience the painful, never-ending hunger that drives the cyclops psyche to the extent that her kin did. Though not much more than a minor physiological difference, it meant that Halbrux developed a milder, more easy-going, and less gluttonous personality. Still, she exhibited her fair share of brutal strength and often responded with fury if attacked, as when an older cousin might be bored or want to take away her supper. As a result, she was typically ignored and left to wander the island on her own. She learned nothing to temper her natural inclinations toward selfishness and cruelty, though socializing more with her family wouldn't have done much to mitigate these tendencies.\n\n Because Halbrux wasn't determinedly hunting her next meal while wandering, she began to pay attention to the ruins that covered the island. She explored them in earnest, entering chambers that hadn't been disturbed in untold generations and finding the occasional historical clue or treasure.\n\n The day of her vision, teenage Halbrux had carefully worked her way through an opening in the ancient ceiling of a mostly submerged great hall. The walls contained faded murals depicting a celebration of some kind. She studied the murals for hours, trying to piece together its narrative but largely failing to comprehend it. Exhausted and demoralized, she fell asleep on the floor—and then the murals came alive! In a vision of vivid detail, Halbrux beheld the ancient day of celebration. The hall's murals recorded a victory over an immense dragon who had threatened the cyclopes' city, and the momentous defeat had ushered in a time of great prosperity. She experienced this moment with the most profound joy of her life.\n\n Halbrux's ability to see the future had never quite worked like it should; instead, she had suddenly gained the ability to see the past. Her explorations took on new intensity, and she sought to experience further visions. This passion solidified into a sense of greater purpose as she began to document and share what she learned. Her kin had little interest in her exploits, though a few of the wiser ones grasped that she was doing something important for cyclopskind.\n\n Documenting the ruins on the island took several years and inspired her to set off in search of new discoveries. Her voyages took her to several other islands in the Shackles. Though not averse to ridding an area of its occupants, she preferred to find uninhabited places or even to make a deal with locals to give her unfettered access. Halbrux has always considered uncovering the lost knowledge of the past empire and triggering her visions about it to be her most important role.\n\nHalbrux has pursued these goals for decades, and her personal knowledge of the Ghol-Gan empire surpasses most known lore about it. She's began to wonder whether her visions are part of something greater, perhaps something that will lead her to restoring the might of the Ghol-Gan empire in the present day. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Campaign Role</title> Halbrux is one of the heroes' chief antagonists in the Prison of the Vacant Eye. She not only works the prisoners hard and summarily executes those who shirk their labor, but she allows her brutish cyclops minions to bully them without repercussions. However, unlike the catfolk warden Yonsuu, Halbrux's main goal in the prison isn't to serve as a jailer. She's a historian captivated by the ruins and determined to study them at any cost. There's a slim chance the heroes might find common cause with Halbrux, as they also know the value of scholarly research. If they offer her the ability to keep studying the ruins in exchange for better behavior (including letting the prisoners go, and eschewing her relationship with her aggressive kin), she accepts—studying the ruins is more important to her than just about anything else.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14)): DC 38\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 36\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 33\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 11\">[Halbrux Far-Sight](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1693)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Unique\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=161\" />\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Giant\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=79\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #171: Hurricane's Howl](/Sources.aspx?ID=101) pg. 88</row>\n\n**Perception** +21; [low-light vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=23)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Cyclops](/Languages.aspx?ID=30), [Jotun](/Languages.aspx?ID=8)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +22, [Crafting](/Skills.aspx?ID=4) +22, [Fortune-Telling Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +22, [Ghol-Gan Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +24, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +22, [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11) +22, [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13) +21, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +19\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +7\r\n\r\n**Dex** +0\r\n\r\n**Con** +2\r\n\r\n**Int** +7\r\n\r\n**Wis** +2\r\n\r\n**Cha** +5\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n_+2 [striking](/Equipment.aspx?ID=280) [greatclub](/Weapons.aspx?ID=22)_, [average manacles](/Equipment.aspx?ID=32) (4)\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 30 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +23 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +17 \r\n\r\n**Will** +21 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 195\n\n**Resolve** When Halbrux rolls a success on a Will save, she<br />gets a critical success instead.<br />**Flash of History** <actions string=\"Free Action\" /> ([divination](/Traits.aspx?ID=47), [fortune](/Traits.aspx?ID=76), [occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120)) **Frequency** three times per day; **Trigger** Halbrux is about to attempt a skill check; **Effect** Halbrux peers into lore of the past and increases the level of success by one step (for example, a success becomes a critical success).\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\n_greatclub_ +24 ([Backswing](/Traits.aspx?ID=173), [Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [Shove](/Traits.aspx?ID=193)),\r\n**Damage** 2d10+9 bludgeoning\r\n\r\n**Divine Spontaneous Spells** DC 30, attack +22\r\n- **Cantrips (6th)**\r\n[Daze](/Spells.aspx?ID=61), [Detect Magic](/Spells.aspx?ID=66), [Light](/Spells.aspx?ID=171), [Prestidigitation](/Spells.aspx?ID=229), [Read Aura](/Spells.aspx?ID=246), [Shield](/Spells.aspx?ID=280)\r\n- **1st**\r\n[Create Water](/Spells.aspx?ID=53), [Purify Food and Drink](/Spells.aspx?ID=241), [Ray of Enfeeblement](/Spells.aspx?ID=244), [Sanctuary](/Spells.aspx?ID=266) (3 slots)\r\n- **2nd**\r\n[Augury](/Spells.aspx?ID=15), [Continual Flame](/Spells.aspx?ID=50), [Death Knell](/Spells.aspx?ID=63), [Heal](/Spells.aspx?ID=148) (3 slots)\r\n- **3rd**\r\n[Blindness](/Spells.aspx?ID=26), [Haste](/Spells.aspx?ID=147), [Neutralize Poison](/Spells.aspx?ID=207), [Wanderer's Guide](/Spells.aspx?ID=368) (3 slots)\r\n- **4th**\r\n[Freedom of Movement](/Spells.aspx?ID=128), [Globe of Invulnerability](/Spells.aspx?ID=137), [Outcast's Curse](/Spells.aspx?ID=211), [Read Omens](/Spells.aspx?ID=247) (3 slots)\r\n- **5th**\r\n[Flame Strike](/Spells.aspx?ID=120), [Harm](/Spells.aspx?ID=146), [Heal](/Spells.aspx?ID=148), [Vampiric Touch](/Spells.aspx?ID=354) (3 slots)\r\n- **6th**\r\n[Heroism](/Spells.aspx?ID=149), [Stoneskin](/Spells.aspx?ID=312), [True Seeing](/Spells.aspx?ID=344) (2 slots)\r\n\r\n**Revelation Spells** DC 30, 3 Focus Points\r\n- **6th**\r\n[Brain Drain](/Spells.aspx?ID=747), [Scholarly Recollection](/Spells.aspx?ID=450), [Vision of Weakness](/Spells.aspx?ID=765)\r\n\r\n**Curse of Torrential Knowledge**   When Halbrux uses her revelation spells, her mind fills with a flood of disorienting information.
