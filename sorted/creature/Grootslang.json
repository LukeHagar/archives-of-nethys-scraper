A grootslang stands 20 feet tall, with skin like plated armor and a pair of massive forearms. It sports six deadly tusks capable of piercing flesh and bone with ease. The rest of its body extends up to 60 feet long. A grootslang's face resembles that of an elephant, but much like its serpentine cousins, it can unhinge its lower jaw to swallow its prey.\n\n A person encountering a grootslang has a slight chance of reasoning with or bribing the beast, possibly escaping a deadly fate. A hoard of gems is no guarantee of safety, however, and a particularly cruel grootslang will just as likely go back on their word upon receiving the offering.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Beast](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2), [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 37\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 35\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 32\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Grootslang.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 16\">[Grootslang](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1433)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"CE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Gargantuan\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Beast\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=20\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [The Mwangi Expanse](/Sources.aspx?ID=89) pg. 298 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +28; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), [scent](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=33) (imprecise) 60 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Aquan](/Languages.aspx?ID=14), [Draconic](/Languages.aspx?ID=2), [Mwangi](/Languages.aspx?ID=39)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +34, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +28, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +26, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +23\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +9\r\n\r\n**Dex** +5\r\n\r\n**Con** +8\r\n\r\n**Int** +5\r\n\r\n**Wis** +6\r\n\r\n**Cha** +0\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Deep Breath** A grootslang can hold its breath for 1 hour.\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 38 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +30 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +27 \r\n\r\n**Will** +26 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 370\n\n**[Attack of Opportunity](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=3)** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> \r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 40 feet, swim 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nfoot +30 ([Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [reach 20 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 3d12+15 bludgeoning\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njaws +28 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [reach 15 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 3d10+15 piercing plus [Improved Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=27)\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\ntail +28 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [reach 30 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 3d10+15 bludgeoning plus [Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=18)\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\ntusk +30 ([Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [reach 20 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 3d12+15 piercing\n\n**Aquatic Elusion** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([Concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32), [Conjuration](/Traits.aspx?ID=33), [Teleportation](/Traits.aspx?ID=156), [Primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=134)) **Requirements** The grootslang is fully immersed in water; **Effect** The grootslang teleports to another body of water within 1 mile that is wide enough to hold the grootslang.\r\n\r\n**Defensive Coil** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" />  The grootslang coils its body.
