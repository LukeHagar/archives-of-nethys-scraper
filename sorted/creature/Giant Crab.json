They use their claws to defend themselves, hunt, and fight other crabs for territory. When confronted with threats from outside their species, most crabs prefer to flee, but when retreat isn't possible, they clamp on to their foes as tightly as they can.\n\nThe statistics presented here represent giant crabs that live close to the water's surface. Crabs that live deeper underwater often exhibit more extreme adaptations to their environment. Crabs who live in the depths where little light reaches gain darkvision and cold resistance, and those adapted to the most hostile reaches of the deep sea can detect nearby creatures through subtle shifts in ocean currents.\n\nThese skittering creatures are prized for their delicious meat, but their size makes them dangerous targets for harvesting.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Animal](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 16\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 14\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 11\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Crab_GiantCrab.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 2\">[Giant Crab](/Monsters.aspx?ID=588)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Animal\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=9\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Aquatic\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=168\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 55 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +8; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\n\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +7, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +8, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +7\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +4\r\n\r\n**Dex** +3\r\n\r\n**Con** +1\r\n\r\n**Int** -4\r\n\r\n**Wis** +2\r\n\r\n**Cha** -3\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 19 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +7 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +9 \r\n\r\n**Will** +8 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 24\n\n**Resistances**\r\nphysical 3 (except bludgeoning)\n\n**Vulnerable to [Prone](/Conditions.aspx?ID=31)** If a creature critically succeeds on a check to [Trip](/Actions.aspx?ID=40) the giant crab, the crab is flipped over onto its back in addition to the usual effects.
