Also known as “duck-billed dinosaurs” due to the unusual shape of their jaws, hadrosaurids are lumbering creatures that can rival an elephant for size, although they tend to be much less aggressive and are prone to flight when confronted with danger rather than stubbornly standing their ground. Many species of hadrosaurids have uniquely shaped crests on their heads that give each species its own unusual profile, making them easily recognizable even to an amateur dinosaur watcher.\n\nGiants and other oversized creatures have been known to domesticate hadrosaurids to serve as livestock. Despite their ability to sprint quickly, they don't make particularly viable mounts due to their timid natures, but in a large group, a panicked gathering of hadrosaurids can wreak great damage with their trampling.\n\nA hadrosaurid can walk for short distances on its hind legs but prefers to graze and travel on all fours. The typical hadrosaurid is 20 to 30 feet long and can weigh up to 10,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Animal](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 19\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 17\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 14\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Dinosaur_Hadrosaur.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 4\">[Hadrosaurid](/Monsters.aspx?ID=615)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Huge\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Animal\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=9\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Dinosaur\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=45\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 81 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +13; [low-light vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=23), [scent (imprecise) 30 feet](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=33)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\n\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +12, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +10\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +6\r\n\r\n**Dex** +2\r\n\r\n**Con** +3\r\n\r\n**Int** -4\r\n\r\n**Wis** +1\r\n\r\n**Cha** +0\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 21 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +12 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +10 \r\n\r\n**Will** +11 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 60\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\ntail +14 ([reach 15 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 2d6+8 bludgeoning\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nfoot +12 ([reach 15 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 2d4+8 bludgeoning\n\n**Sprint** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" />  **Frequency** once per minute; **Effect** The hadrosaurid Strides twice.
