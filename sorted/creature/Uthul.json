Its aura remains active, but it can’t make debris Strikes nor use Lightning Crash. Instead, any creature the uthul moves through takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage and 2d12 electricity damage. A creature can take this damage only once per round. A Large or smaller creature must also succeed at a DC 32 Reflex save or be picked up and held suspended within the vortex. Suspended creatures move with the uthul. A creature can attempt to escape by spending an action to attempt a DC 32 Reflex save (or a DC 32 Acrobatics check to maneuver in flight if it has a fly Speed). Upon escaping, or when the uthul transforms back into its storm cloud form, a suspended creature is hurled 1d4 × 10 feet in a random direction, then falls unless it can fly or otherwise remain aloft.
