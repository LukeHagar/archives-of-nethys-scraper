A quintessivore doesn't immediately kill its prey—it drags the creature to its lair and separates the victim's soul from their body with its bladed limbs. The flicking blades then pull out the creature's individuality, reducing the soul down to pure soul-stuff called quintessence, which the quintessivore then consumes.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Beast](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2), [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 32\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 30\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 27\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Quintessivore.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 10\">[Quintessivore](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1270)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Rare\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=137\" />\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Beast\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=20\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 3](/Sources.aspx?ID=66) pg. 209</row>\n\n**Perception** +17; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Abyssal](/Languages.aspx?ID=12), [Aklo](/Languages.aspx?ID=13), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Infernal](/Languages.aspx?ID=19), [Undercommon](/Languages.aspx?ID=11)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2) +25, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +17, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +19, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +20\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +3\r\n\r\n**Dex** +6\r\n\r\n**Con** +6\r\n\r\n**Int** +7\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** +3\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n_scroll of [dimensional anchor_](/Spells.aspx?ID=70), _scroll of [fly_](/Spells.aspx?ID=125)\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 28 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +22 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +20 \r\n\r\n**Will** +21 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 180\n\n**Instant Suspension** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> **Trigger** The quintessivore reduces a creature within 15 feet of it to 0 Hit Points; **Effect** The quintessivore uses Suspend Soul, targeting the creature.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 40 feet, climb 20 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nblade-leg +22 ([Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179), [Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103)),\r\n**Damage** 1d10+9 slashing damage plus 1d10 negative damage and tattered soul\r\n\r\n**Arcane Prepared Spells** DC 29, attack +21\r\n- **Cantrips (5th)**\r\n[Daze](/Spells.aspx?ID=61), [Detect Magic](/Spells.aspx?ID=66), [Mage Hand](/Spells.aspx?ID=177), [Ray of Frost](/Spells.aspx?ID=245), [Read Aura](/Spells.aspx?ID=246)\r\n- **1st**\r\n[Feather Fall](/Spells.aspx?ID=111), [Fleet Step](/Spells.aspx?ID=122), [Ray of Enfeeblement](/Spells.aspx?ID=244)\r\n- **2nd**\r\n[Comprehend Language](/Spells.aspx?ID=46), [See Invisibility](/Spells.aspx?ID=271), [Web](/Spells.aspx?ID=374)\r\n- **3rd**\r\n[Slow](/Spells.aspx?ID=289), [Vampiric Touch](/Spells.aspx?ID=354) (×2)\r\n- **4th**\r\n[Clairvoyance](/Spells.aspx?ID=40), [Enervation](/Spells.aspx?ID=687) (×2)\r\n- **5th**\r\n[Black Tentacles](/Spells.aspx?ID=23), [Grim Tendrils](/Spells.aspx?ID=141), [Passwall](/Spells.aspx?ID=216)\r\n\r\n**Feed on Quintessence**  ([Arcane](/Traits.aspx?ID=11), [Exploration](/Traits.aspx?ID=66), [Manipulate](/Traits.aspx?ID=104), [Necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) Over the course of 1 hour, the quintessivore removes and deconstructs the soul of a creature.

The creature can't decrease or increase its HP or dying value for 10 minutes. The creature can attempt a DC 29 Will save to avoid this effect. If the creature receives magical [healing](/Traits.aspx?ID=89), it can attempt a new save, ending the effect and being healed normally on a success. The effect ends if the quintessivore uses Suspend Soul again.\r\n\r\n**Tattered Soul**   A creature hit by the quintessivore's blade-leg Strike must succeed at a DC 29 Fortitude save or become [drained 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=10) (drained 2 on a critical failure).
