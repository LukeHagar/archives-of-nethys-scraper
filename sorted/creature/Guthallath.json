Few have seen the entire body of a guthallath, though; most of the time such a relic is buried up to its neck, covered in moss and stranded in some forgotten place. Yet, every so often, one of these harbingers of destruction reactivates in response to some unknown stimulus or rallying call, and when this happens, woe be unto any who stand in its way.\n\n While the guthallath’s ancient enemies are gone, it is an engine of pure destruction, designed to rampage for weeks or even months. While not intelligent enough to enjoy or regret its acts, the guthallath cannot be reasoned with—it is unaffected by most magic, and is unpredictable in how it selects its targets (and creatures it spares).\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Construct](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2), [Crafting](/Skills.aspx?ID=4)): DC 44\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 42\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 39\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Guthallath.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 19\">[Guthallath](/Monsters.aspx?ID=253)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Rare\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=137\" />\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Gargantuan\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Construct\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=35\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 199</row>\n\n**Perception** +30; darkvision, [_true seeing_](/Spells.aspx?ID=344)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\n\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +25, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +40\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +10\r\n\r\n**Dex** +2\r\n\r\n**Con** +8\r\n\r\n**Int** -4\r\n\r\n**Wis** +0\r\n\r\n**Cha** -1\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 43 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +38 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +32 \r\n\r\n**Will** +30 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 325\n\n**Immunities**\r\nbleed, death effects, disease, doomed, drained, fatigued, healing, magic (see below), necromancy, nonlethal attacks, paralyzed, poison, sickened, unconscious\r\n\r\n**Resistances**\r\nphysical 15 (except adamantine)\n\n**Erosion Aura** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=134)) 120 feet.
