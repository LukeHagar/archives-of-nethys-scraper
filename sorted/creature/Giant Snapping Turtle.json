Measuring over 20 feet long and weighing thousands of pounds, this creature is capable of swallowing a humanoid whole. Swamp-dwelling societies, particularly [boggards](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=16) and [lizardfolk](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=71), have often tried to domesticate giant snapping turtles to serve as powerful guardians, but in most cases the casualties pile up quickly. Those unfortunate enough to be swallowed whole by a giant snapping turtle find that even the creature's stomach is somewhat armored, making it difficult to cut through.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Animal](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 26\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 24\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 21\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Turtle_SnappingTurtle.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 9\">[Giant Snapping Turtle](/Monsters.aspx?ID=837)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Gargantuan\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Animal\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=9\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 269 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +17; [low-light vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=23), [scent (imprecise) 30 feet](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=33)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\n\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +20\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +7\r\n\r\n**Dex** +0\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** -4\r\n\r\n**Wis** +4\r\n\r\n**Cha** -2\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Deep Breath** The giant snapping turtle can hold its breath for 2 hours.\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 28 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +19 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +15 \r\n\r\n**Will** +19 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 170\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 20 feet, swim 40 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njaws +22,\r\n**Damage** 2d12+10 piercing plus [Improved Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=27)\n\n**Capsize** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([Attack](/Traits.aspx?ID=15), [Move](/Traits.aspx?ID=114)) The turtle tries to capsize an adjacent aquatic vessel of its size or smaller.
