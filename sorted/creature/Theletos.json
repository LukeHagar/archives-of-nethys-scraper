A theletos is a roughly spherical mass of crystals from which emerge four limbs, each split at the elbow and ending in three-fingered hands. A pair of crystalline tentacles also emerges from its body. Those who have been damaged by a theletos's tentacles describe a disorienting dilemma as they simultaneously feel forced to make a single choice while also being overwhelmed by the endless options available to choose from. Theletoses are more likely than most aeons to interfere in non-aeon societies, particularly in regions with draconian laws. Their involvement is twofold; a theletos concerns itself with both the freedom of individuals and the laws that restrict these individuals, even (or especially) when the two are in opposition.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Monitor](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 23\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 21\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 18\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Aeon_Theletos.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 7\">[Theletos](/Monsters.aspx?ID=536)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"LN\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Aeon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=208\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Monitor\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=111\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 8 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +18; darkvision\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\nenvisioning\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2) +16, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +16, [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13) +18, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +15\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +4\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +3\r\n\r\n**Int** +3\r\n\r\n**Wis** +5\r\n\r\n**Cha** +3\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Envisioning** When a theletos conveys information, it does so wordlessly through psychic projections.
