Their bodies consist of an oval abdomen, eight hollow tentacles, and a thick, tail-like limb ending in a ventral tube, which resembles a lamprey's mouth and is capable of intaking fluids at an astounding rate. While quoppopaks can clumsily maneuver on land, they prefer to move on water; quoppopaks glide along the surface of lakes or the ocean by thrusting their ventral tubes into the water, cycling liquid up through their bodies, then spraying the water back out in a high-pressure stream through their hollow, spear-like tentacles. Though the ventral tube can't expel fluids, it still poses a substantial threat to other creatures. Quoppopaks have gills, but they are located inside the creatures' abdomens, allowing them to draw their air from the water they siphon through their ventral tubes. Quoppopaks can hold some water in their abdomens for quick forays on land, but this is akin to humans holding their breath to go underwater, and the monsters' water reserves quickly deplete.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Aberration](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11)): DC 28\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 26\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 23\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Quappokap.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 11\">[Quoppopak](/Monsters.aspx?ID=779)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"NE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Aberration\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=1\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Aquatic\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=168\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 219 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Perception** +22; [low-light vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=23)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Aquan](/Languages.aspx?ID=14)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +23, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +22, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +23\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +7\r\n\r\n**Dex** +6\r\n\r\n**Con** +5\r\n\r\n**Int** -2\r\n\r\n**Wis** +5\r\n\r\n**Cha** +0\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 31 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +22 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +23 \r\n\r\n**Will** +18 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**HP** 195\n\n**[Attack of Opportunity](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=3)** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> Tentacle only.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 15 feet, swim 40 feet, water glide 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nbeak +24 ([reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 3d8+13 piercing\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\ntentacle +24 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [reach 15 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 2d8+13 bludgeoning plus [Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=18)\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nventral tube +24 ([reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 2d6+13 slashing plus 1d6 [persistent bleed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=29)\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nwater jet +23 ([range 100 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=248), [Water](/Traits.aspx?ID=165)),\r\n**Damage** 2d6+13 bludgeoning plus [Push](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=25) 5 feet\n\n**Flooding Thrust** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" />  **Requirements** The quoppopak's ventral tube is in water; **Effect** The quoppopak uses Tentacle Stab against a creature within reach; if either of these Strikes hits, the creature must attempt a DC 30 Reflex save.
