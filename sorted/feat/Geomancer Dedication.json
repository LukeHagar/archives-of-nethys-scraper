The GM might determine an attunement applies as long as it's prevalent enough around you. For instance, you might be in aquatic terrain on a riverbank or on a boat. Similarly, one place might count as multiple types of terrain, such as a mountain in the far north being both arctic and mountain. In this case, you choose only one terrain attunement effect, even if the spell has traits that would apply to each terrain type.\n\nCertain terrain attunements affect your enemies instead of you. If they do, when you cast the spell you apply the listed effect to all enemies who are either adjacent to you, in the area of the spell, or targeted by the spell. These enemies receive the listed saving throw against your spell DC to attempt to avoid the effect. \n<ul><li>**Aquatic** ([water](/Traits.aspx?ID=165)) You ride the currents of water. If you're in the water, you gain a swim Speed equal to your land Speed.

You gain resistance to physical damage (except [adamantine](/Equipment.aspx?ID=374)) equal to the spell level for 1 round.</li><li>**Plains** ([plant](/Traits.aspx?ID=125)) The growing fields and pulsing vitality of the plains provide you vigor.
