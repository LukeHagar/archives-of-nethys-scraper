You can expend your hourly use of _dimension door_ as a free action when you begin your turn. If you do, your Strides are augmented until the end of your turn, allowing you to instantly teleport to any point you could reach with your Speed instead of traversing normally to the location. While augmented, your Strides gain the [conjuration](/Traits.aspx?ID=33) and [teleportation](/Traits.aspx?ID=156) traits. Your augmented Strides don't trigger reactions that can be triggered by [move](/Traits.aspx?ID=114) actions or upon leaving or entering a square, unless those reactions trigger on teleportation.",
