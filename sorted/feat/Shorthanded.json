In a pinch, however, you can operate it with fewer people, provided you know what you're doing. You can operate a siege weapon with fewer than the minimum number of crew, at an increasing penalty. You and your crew take a –2 penalty to checks to [Load](/Rules.aspx?ID=1624), [Aim](/Rules.aspx?ID=1625), [Launch](/Rules.aspx?ID=1626), move, or [Repair](/Actions.aspx?ID=42) the weapon for each person below the minimum crew. The maximum number of missing minimum crew members you can handle with this feat is 5. For example, if a siege weapon had a minimum crew size of 8, you would still need a crew of 3, and you would take a –10 penalty when doing so.",
