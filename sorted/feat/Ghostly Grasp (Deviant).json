The arm reaches up to 15 feet, grabs an unattended object of 1 Bulk or less, and immediately deposits it in one of your free hands or at your feet. Alternatively, it reaches up to 15 feet and performs a simple Interact action like pushing open a window, though it can't perform actions that require significant mechanical dexterity. For every 5 levels you have, the amount the hand can lift increases by 1 Bulk, and the arm's range increases by 15 feet. Being ghostly, the arm can affect [ghosts](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=51), [spirits](/Traits.aspx?ID=149), and other [incorporeal](/Traits.aspx?ID=222) entities, though in most cases, you need an awakening for this to be useful.",
