The effects apply to a single weapon the creature is holding or one of the creature's [unarmed](/Traits.aspx?ID=199) attacks. You choose the rune and the effect applies to all creatures. You can use an action, which has the [concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32) trait, to extend the duration of the rune for 1 additional round up to a maximum of 1 minute. If this would give a weapon or unarmed attack more property runes than its normal maximum, an existing property rune (as the creature chooses) is suppressed until the spell ends.",
