These domains must be chosen from among your deity’s domains, your deity’s alternate domains, and up to one domain that isn’t on either list and isn’t anathematic to your deity. Any domain spell you cast from a domain that isn’t on either of your deity’s lists is always heightened to 1 level lower than usual for a focus spell.

If you take this feat and previously benefited from any effect that requires a domain your splinter faith doesn’t include, such as a domain spell from [Domain Initiate](/Feats.aspx?ID=265), you lose that effect.",
