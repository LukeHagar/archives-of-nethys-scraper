Reality buckles and twists under your sudden power—each tiefling has a unique transformation, but it might include sulfurous flames, choruses of shrieks, or twisting, serpentine lightning. Every creature within 10 feet of you is [deafened](/Conditions.aspx?ID=8) and [dazzled](/Conditions.aspx?ID=7) for 1 round unless they succeed at a Fortitude save using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. Your final form has the effects of [_divine vessel_](/Spells.aspx?ID=85) for a deity that shares an alignment with your fiendish lineage. Your final form resembles a creature from your fiendish lineage, and you remain in that form for 1 minute. While in your final form, you can cast [_chilling darkness_](/Spells.aspx?ID=36), [_fireball_](/Spells.aspx?ID=119), and [_lightning bolt_](/Spells.aspx?ID=172) as 6th-level divine innate spells, once each per use of this feat.\n\n When you emerge from your final form, you become [drained 3](/Conditions.aspx?ID=10). In addition, if you have this feat, you gain weakness 10 to good even when not in your final form, and you take good damage even if you aren't evil.\n\n**Special** At the GM's discretion, the specific elements of this feat can be adjusted to better fit the tiefling's lineage—for example, a GM might decide that a particular [beastbrood](/Feats.aspx?ID=2449) tiefling could cast a 6th-level [_phantasmal killer_](/Spells.aspx?ID=219) instead of _fireball_.",
