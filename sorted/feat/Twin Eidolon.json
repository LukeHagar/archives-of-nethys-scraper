While using Twin Eidolon, you use your eidolon's statistics other than your mental ability modifiers, including its evolutions. You can't cast spells (except spells your eidolon could cast), Activate or otherwise benefit from magic items that normally benefit you and not your eidolon, or use other actions it can't perform.
