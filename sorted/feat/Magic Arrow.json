When you use Magic Arrow, you can choose a type of magical ammunition that is typically not available to the type of ammunition you're using—for example, you can use [_climbing bolt_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=160) on an arrow, even though that magical ammunition is normally only found on bolts.\n\n**Special** You can select this feat multiple times.
