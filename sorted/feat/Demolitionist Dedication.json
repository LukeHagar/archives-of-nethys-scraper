The bombs explode at a specific time you determine (such as after your next action or at the start of your next turn, to a maximum of 1 minute), dealing their damage and splash damage to the inanimate object.

As a reminder, since you didn't throw the bombs, [Calculated Splash](/Feats.aspx?ID=99) and similar effects don't apply.
