The hideaway’s access point appears as an obviously magical gap within 1 foot of your body. Only you can access the hideaway; you can you use an Interact action each round to physically hold it open for another person. A successful [_dispel magic_](/Spells.aspx?ID=78) spell or similar effect against your spell DC and the hideaway’s counteract level of 2 expels the object; the object is also expelled if you become unconscious. After a successful _dispel magic _spell or when you become conscious again, the hideaway immediately reforms with no additional action from you. You can also dismiss the hideaway (if it is empty) or re-form it using a single action with the envision component.",
