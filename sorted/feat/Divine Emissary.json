It automatically succeeds its check to Aid you with Religion checks or automatically critically succeeds if you're a master in Religion.\n\n **Luminous** Your familiar glows with a comforting light. It sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for the next 30 feet. It can suppress or resume this light by using an action, which has the [concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32) trait.\n\n **Medic** Your familiar can draw upon the power of your deity to Cast a Spell once per day. The familiar can cast the 1-action version of [_heal_](/Spells.aspx?ID=148) at a level 2 levels lower than your highest-level spell slot, which it can cast only on you. You must be able to cast 3rd-level spells from spell slots to select this ability.\n\n **Radiant** Your familiar is filled with a divine radiance that makes it resistant to the forces of evil. Your familiar gains resistance to evil and [negative](/Traits.aspx?ID=118) damage equal to half your level.",
