You gain the [Alchemical Crafting](/Feats.aspx?ID=752) feat, a pool of infused reagents equal to your level, and advanced alchemy (allowing you to make alchemical items during your daily preparations without the normal cost or time expenditure). You can use your infused reagents only to make fireworks, Launch a Fireworks Display, and use other feats from the Fireworks Technician archetype. Your advanced alchemy level is 1. The rules for these are in the [Alchemical Crafting](/Feats.aspx?ID=752) feat, and rules for infused reagents and advanced alchemy are listed in the [alchemist](/Classes.aspx?ID=1) class. If you gain infused reagents from more than one source, you use the highest number of reagents to determine your pool rather than adding them together.\n\n You can also create special fireworks displays using your infused reagents, designed to create distinctive effects you can use to make onlookers marvel and even to gain an advantage in combat. You gain the Launch Fireworks Display action and learn some basic displays, and you can learn additional, more complex displays through other firework technician feats. The DC for any display is equal to your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.\n\n **Launch Fireworks Display** <actions string=\"Single Action to Three Actions\" /> (see below); ([manipulate](/Traits.aspx?ID=104)); **Cost** 1 or more batches of infused reagents; **Requirements** You have a free hand; **Effect** You set off a fireworks display.

A firework display has the listed traits, and if it costs more than 1 batch of infused reagents, it is noted in its Cost entry.\n\n **Comet** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=163)) You shoot a streak of shining light in a 60-foot line.

As part of this action, you can also [Point Out](/Actions.aspx?ID=97) a single creature in the line, and your allies do not need to hear or understand you.\n\n **Flower** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=163)) You ignite a ring of sparks, creating a shape that might be reminiscent of a flower blooming in the sky. Each enemy with 20 feet of you must attempt a Fortitude save.

When you launch a salute display, you can choose a [confused](/Conditions.aspx?ID=5) or [fascinated](/Conditions.aspx?ID=14) ally within 60 feet. If the ally you chose is fascinated, the noise is so violent that it acts as a [hostile effect](/Rules.aspx?ID=300) for the purpose of their fascinated condition (though it has no negative repercussions) automatically ending most applications of the fascinated condition. If they're confused, the sound is so loud and violent that it might snap the ally out of confusion. They can immediately attempt the flat check to remove the confused condition which normally occurs when a creature is damaged.
