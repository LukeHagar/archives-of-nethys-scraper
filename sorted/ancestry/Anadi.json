Some tones look simple or muted while other remain striking and vibrant, with most patterns inherited from an anadi's parentage. A typical anadi measures five feet in length from their front legs to their rear legs when standing comfortably.\n\n All anadi possesses the ability to transform into a human guise. This form can resemble any human ethnicity, but it's usually one that blends in with the region of an anadi's hatching. Anadi reach physical maturity after 13 years, going through multiple phases of molting along the way. A typical anadi lives to be about 80 years old.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Society</title>\r\nAnadi live in a communal society, sharing peaceful lives farming mushrooms or weaving warm blankets. Their culture places great value on cooperation and mutual respect. Due to this cultural upbringing, anadi often have issues facing severe conflict and often come off to other ancestries as very shy. Their history of dealing with arachnophobia in other peoples—which anadi understand is often instinctual and very difficult to control—likewise means that anadi do their best to be accommodating and comforting, even in situations that aren't necessarily fair to them.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Alignment and Religion</title>\r\nThe cooperative nature of anadi society and their dislike of violence means many anadi lean toward good alignments. They're more often neutral than chaotic or lawful, though the latter aren't unheard of.  Legends say [Grandmother Spider](/Deities.aspx?ID=37) rescued anadi people from servitude and brought them to Golarion, becoming their patron deity in the process. Her values of mutual care and playful trickery interweave into anadi culture, and even those who don't worship her tell tales of her adventures.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Adventurers</title>\r\nAnadi who answer the call to adventure often do so to learn more about the world at large. Common anadi backgrounds include [artisan](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=4), [emissary](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=12), [herbalist](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=20), [hunter](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=22), and [scholar](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=36). Anadi adventurers who want to support their communities often become [clerics](/Classes.aspx?ID=5) or [druids](/Classes.aspx?ID=6). [Rogue](/Classes.aspx?ID=10) remains a popular choice among those who seek to hide their true form.

Only reveal your true form to people who have earned your trust. Openly express sympathy for misrepresented and unfairly stigmatized cultures.
