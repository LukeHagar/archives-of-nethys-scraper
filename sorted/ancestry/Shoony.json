Their fur can be a variety of hues and patterns, with the most common colors being fawn or black, and their loose skin gives even the fittest shoony a pudgy appearance. Shoonies have short, curly tails that sometimes wag involuntarily when the shoony is content or particularly excited or pleased. Like canines, shoonies cannot sweat; they pant to mitigate heat and exertion, and it is not uncommon to see a shoony with a perpetually lolling tongue.\n\n A shoony reaches maturity after just 8 to 10 years, and the elders of their villages rarely reach the age of 50. Little differentiates male and female shoonies except during the late stages of pregnancy, and as they age, both sexes develop graying facial fur, wrinkled skin, and frail joints. The average shoony is 3-1/2 feet tall and weighs 100 pounds.\n\n<title level=\"2\">Society</title>\r\nDespite the shoony drive toward communal living, most shoony settlements are farming villages with populations of no more than a hundred. Shoonies work hard to make their lands bountiful and recognize that large, dense populations can negatively affect the ecosystem. Monster attacks, natural disasters, and exploitation from stronger cultures have all also limited the spread of shoonies across the Inner Sea region.\n\n Despite their short lifespans, shoonies are happy-go-lucky people with an irrepressible love for the land and their fellow shoonies, and remain optimistic even under the worst circumstances. The simple pleasures of living on this beautiful world, engaging in hard work, and surrounding themselves with loved ones motivate shoonies to push through the hardships that all too often befall their people.\n\n<title level=\"2\">Alignment and Religion</title>\r\nMost shoony societies encourage empathy and loyalty, so they’re rarely evil, but they’re also practical, traditional, and timid. Most shoony adventurers are neutral good or lawful good. Religion is a cornerstone of shoony village life; shoonies primarily worshipped Aroden until his apparent death. In his absence, many shoonies have adopted [Erastil](/Deities.aspx?ID=6) as their patron deity because his emphasis on family, community, and living off the land naturally meshes with typical shoony values. Noble shoonies— especially warriors—sometimes look to [Iomedae](/Deities.aspx?ID=9) as an exemplar of integrity, hard work, and sacrifice.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Adventurers</title>\r\nFew shoonies willingly choose to leave their homeland and friends in favor of facing the unknown, and the circumstances that lead a shoony to adventure are often dramatic and life-altering, if not tragic. That said, some shoonies do travel the world in search of riches to bring back to their village or to avenge their kinfolk, and shoony adventurers who show bravery or ingenuity are sure to earn a place in the legends of their people.\n\n Typical shoonies have the [acolyte](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=1), [farmhand](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=14), [hunter](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=22), [laborer](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=23), or [warrior](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=35) backgrounds from the _Core Rulebook_, or the [animal wrangler](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=135) or [rigger](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=142) backgrounds from the _Extinction Curse Player’s Guide_. Many shoony adventurers are [fighters](/Classes.aspx?ID=7) who hone their skills to become stalwart defenders of their friends. Some shoonies pursue religious study and become [clerics](/Classes.aspx?ID=5) or [champions](/Classes.aspx?ID=4), while others develop their foraging and hunting skills as talented [druids](/Classes.aspx?ID=6) and [rangers](/Classes.aspx?ID=9).\n\n<title level=\"2\">Names</title>\r\nWith their strong family values and emphasis on found friends, it’s no wonder that shoonies take particular pride in naming their children after other loved ones. Shoony names are short, guttural, and often sound like loose strings of unassociated vowels and soft consonants to people of other ancestries.
