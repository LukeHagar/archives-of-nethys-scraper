Members Assassin (Creature 8), Bandit (Creature 2), Burglar (Creature 4), Charlatan (Creature 3), Fence (Creature 5), Grave Robber (Creature 1), Ruffian (Creature 2) Criminal Scams Common scams criminals run include sending fake collectors for nonexistent charities to seek donations for the diseased and downtrodden; rigged games of chance at local fairs offering worthless prizes, and flashy sideshows concealing the work of pickpockets in the audience; and plants who offer to help travelers find accommodations but lead them to inns with exorbitant prices. Fantasy Crimes While many crimes in Pathfinder are similar to crimes in the real world, certain crimes are possible only in a world of magic. These include using magic to win a wager, malicious uses of curses, violating autonomy with enchantment magic, falsifying divinations, violating privacy with divinations, or trespassing via teleportation. More Scams Fraudsters sell fake alchemical items, medicines, charms, talismans, or other minor magics. Unscrupulous moneylenders take advantage of lax business regulations to employ predatory repayment terms. Phony fortune-tellers and mediums use cold-reading techniques to lull gullible marks. Protection Money Criminal organizations often find it easier to demand protection money from locals than go to the trouble of stealing it. “Protection” includes an implicit assumption that those who pay up are safe from those criminals, and some also promise retribution against other criminals.
