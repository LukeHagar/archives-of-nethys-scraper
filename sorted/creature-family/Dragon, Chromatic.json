Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each color of dragon unleashes its own flavor of murderous cruelty—be it by claw, tooth, or breath—and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful as they age. Their lust for treasure, food, bloodshed, and control are legendary. Physically powerful with egos to match, these dragons are often morally depraved and act as criminal masterminds, vicious tyrants, or voracious raiders. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Shape-Changing Dragons</title> Some dragons can take humanoid form, allowing them to infiltrate settlements or influence others without revealing their true nature. They gain the following ability:<br /> **Change Shape** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([arcane](/Traits.aspx?ID=11), [concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32), [polymorph](/Traits.aspx?ID=127), [transmutation](/Traits.aspx?ID=157)) The dragon takes on the appearance of any Small or Medium humanoid. This doesn’t change its Speed or attack and damage bonuses with its Strikes, but might change the damage type its Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning). \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Chromatic Dragon Spellcasters</title> Each type of chromatic dragon features a sidebar on spellcasting dragons of that type. To make a chromatic dragon spellcaster, remove the dragon’s Draconic Frenzy and Draconic Momentum abilities, and give it the spells outlined in its sidebar. You can swap out any number of these with other arcane spells, provided you keep the same number of spells for each level. You might also want to increase the dragon’s Intelligence or Charisma modifier by 1 or 2 to reflect its mastery of magic. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Chromatic Dragons of Golarion</title> The chromatic dragons that dwell around the Inner Sea region are cruel and sinister monsters who inspire as much fear as reverence. These terrible beasts are no mere myth, however, but a very real threat to the people with whom they share their lands. Most dwell in the wild places of the world, and only the most brazen of them regularly meddle in mortal affairs. The dragons of Golarion believe that they are descended from two original beings, Apsu and Tiamat, and their rich mythology attempts to explain the origins of the age-old war between chromatic and metallic dragons.\n\n Black dragons thrive in swampy wildernesses like the Mushfens in Varisia or the wrecked coastline now known as the Sodden Lands, while blue dragons prefer the sand-swept deserts of Thuvia and Osirion. Brutish green dragons roam the forests of the River Kingdoms in abundance and even the elven kingdom of Kyonin, particularly in the demon-tainted Tanglebriar. One of the most infamous red dragons, Aashaq, a wyrm priestess of the draconic god Dahak, makes her home among the isles of the Shackles, where she lords over her followers and leads raids throughout the Inner Sea region. White dragons, though they may be found in virtually any mountain range in Avistan, are perhaps most prevalent around the Crown of the World, where they threaten travelers caravaning across the Path of Aganhei.\n\n<title level=\"2\">Group Families</title>\r\n[Dragon, Black](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=165), [Dragon, Blue](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=166), [Dragon, Green](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=167), [Dragon, Red](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=168), [Dragon, White](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=169)\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_4_RelatedCreatures.png\">Apsu</title>\r\n\r\nApsu, the Waybringer, is the god of good dragons, leadership, and peace.
