Their beauty is a source of great pride but is also something of a weakness, as crystal dragons are easily angered by insults about their appearance. Despite their relatively benign natures when compared to other true dragons, crystal dragons can be short tempered and prone to finding insults where none were intended. Although their opinions are changeable, crystal dragons prefer orderly environments and are not fond of sudden interruptions or distractions.\n\n  Crystal dragons build their lairs in underground grottoes, where they cultivate environments of great beauty. Their exacting standards and vivid imaginations mean that they are always working to improve the appearance or layout of some part of their lair. These lairs are unique to each individual crystal dragon, but there are always plenty of reflective surfaces that allow the dragon to observe their own appearance. These range from crystals to reflecting pools to finely crafted mirrors, which are arranged throughout the lair in a pleasing array. Gifts of well-crafted or magical mirrors are an excellent way to curry favor with a crystal dragon.\n\n  Although crystal dragons are easily distracted by their sparkling collections or their vanity, they remain good-hearted creatures at the core and make friends quickly. While a crystal dragon tends to find evil creatures uncouth and unpleasant, any other nearby denizen or inhabitant of their home could become fast friends or beloved pets, depending upon the creature's capacity for conversation (and for providing the frequent praise and compliments that crystal dragons hunger for).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Adult Crystal Dragon](/Monsters.aspx?ID=628) (Creature 11), [Ancient Crystal Dragon](/Monsters.aspx?ID=629) (Creature 16), [Young Crystal Dragon](/Monsters.aspx?ID=627) (Creature 7)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Crystal Dragon Spellcasters</title>\r\n\r\nCrystal dragon spellcasters tend to cast the following spells. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Young</title> **Primal Prepared Spells** DC 25, attack +18; **3rd** [_earthbind_](/Spells.aspx?ID=94), [_meld into stone_](/Spells.aspx?ID=188); **2nd** [_faerie fire_](/Spells.aspx?ID=107), [_glitterdust_](/Spells.aspx?ID=136), [_shatter_](/Spells.aspx?ID=279); **1st** [_grease_](/Spells.aspx?ID=140), [_mending_](/Spells.aspx?ID=189), [_pass without trace_](/Spells.aspx?ID=215); **Cantrips (3rd)** [_acid splash_](/Spells.aspx?ID=3), [_detect magic_](/Spells.aspx?ID=66), [_light_](/Spells.aspx?ID=171), [_prestidigitation_](/Spells.aspx?ID=229), [_telekinetic projectile_](/Spells.aspx?ID=334) \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Adult</title> **Primal Prepared Spells** DC 30, attack +24; as young crystal dragon, plus **5th** [_cloak of colors_](/Spells.aspx?ID=41), [_wall of stone_](/Spells.aspx?ID=365); **4th** [_hallucinatory terrain_](/Spells.aspx?ID=145), [_shape stone_](/Spells.aspx?ID=276), [_stoneskin_](/Spells.aspx?ID=312); **3rd** [_haste_](/Spells.aspx?ID=147); **Cantrips (5th)** [_dancing lights_](/Spells.aspx?ID=58), [_detect magic_](/Spells.aspx?ID=66), [_light_](/Spells.aspx?ID=171), [_prestidigitation_](/Spells.aspx?ID=229), [_telekinetic projectile_](/Spells.aspx?ID=334) \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Ancient</title> **Primal Prepared Spells** DC 37, attack +32; as adult crystal dragon, plus **7th** [_energy aegis_](/Spells.aspx?ID=100), [_spell turning_](/Spells.aspx?ID=297), [_volcanic eruption_](/Spells.aspx?ID=360); **6th** [_flesh to stone_](/Spells.aspx?ID=123), [_stone tell_](/Spells.aspx?ID=310), [_true seeing_](/Spells.aspx?ID=344); **5th** [_chromatic wall_](/Spells.aspx?ID=37); **Cantrips (7th)** [_dancing lights_](/Spells.aspx?ID=58), [_detect magic_](/Spells.aspx?ID=66), [_light_](/Spells.aspx?ID=171), [_prestidigitation_](/Spells.aspx?ID=229), [_telekinetic projectile_](/Spells.aspx?ID=334)\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_4_RelatedCreatures.png\">Shardizhad</title>\r\n\r\nStill a relatively young crystal dragon, Shardizhad has already made a name for herself in the city of Wati in Osirion.
