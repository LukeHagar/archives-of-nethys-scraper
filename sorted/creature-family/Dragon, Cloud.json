Cloud dragons range in color from light blue to a pale, milky white and have thick, curling horns and rather short snouts. They keep lairs among the extreme altitudes of the highest mountain peaks but are away on their many journeys as often as they're at home. Cloud dragons spend long hours surveying the lands they fly over from great heights, but they are creatures of whim, making it hard to predict what will pique their curiosity and bring them winging down to converse or investigate something on the ground. Cloud dragons seldom perform acts of outright malice, but they are not often charitable either. A cloud dragon is as likely to simply pluck something they desire off the ground and fly away with it as they are to bargain fairly.\n\n  A cloud dragon's ever-changing interests never seem to stray toward the complicated schemes and long-term plans of other dragons. These rovers are creatures of the moment, and although they are as mentally gifted as other true dragons, their interests remain in the here and now. Yet the cloud dragon's penchant for living in the moment is not a personality flaw—they're more than capable of anticipating long-term results of their actions and won't make foolish choices simply to pursue a current interest. At the same time, cloud dragons have little interest in worrying about the future and are as confident in their ability to handle tomorrow's problems as they are today's.\n\n  Cloud dragon hoards tend to be well-guarded or well-hidden, as a natural result of their roving habits often taking them away from their lairs for extended periods. Their treasuries include a wide variety of items—they are driven to gather a broad range of prizes rather than collecting one type of item intensively. To a cloud dragon, a diversified hoard is a perfect hoard.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Adult Cloud Dragon](/Monsters.aspx?ID=625) (Creature 14), [Ancient Cloud Dragon](/Monsters.aspx?ID=626) (Creature 19), [Young Cloud Dragon](/Monsters.aspx?ID=624) (Creature 10)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Cloud Dragon Spellcasters</title>\r\n\r\nCloud dragon spellcasters tend to cast the following spells. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Young</title> **Primal Prepared Spells** DC 29, attack +23; **4th** [_freedom of movement_](/Spells.aspx?ID=128), [_hallucinatory terrain_](/Spells.aspx?ID=145), [_speak with plants_](/Spells.aspx?ID=294); **3rd** [_earthbind_](/Spells.aspx?ID=94), [_haste_](/Spells.aspx?ID=147), [_stinking cloud_](/Spells.aspx?ID=309); **2nd** [_animal messenger_](/Spells.aspx?ID=11), [_faerie fire_](/Spells.aspx?ID=107), [_speak with animals_](/Spells.aspx?ID=293); **1st** [_feather fall_](/Spells.aspx?ID=111), [_negate aroma_](/Spells.aspx?ID=206), [_shocking grasp_](/Spells.aspx?ID=283); **Cantrips (4th)** [_dancing lights_](/Spells.aspx?ID=58), [_detect magic_](/Spells.aspx?ID=66), [_electric arc_](/Spells.aspx?ID=97), [_prestidigitation_](/Spells.aspx?ID=229), [_read aura_](/Spells.aspx?ID=246) \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Adult</title> **Primal Prepared Spells** DC 34, attack +29; as young cloud dragon, plus **6th** [_heal_](/Spells.aspx?ID=148), [_slow_](/Spells.aspx?ID=289), [_true seeing_](/Spells.aspx?ID=344); **5th** [_banishment_](/Spells.aspx?ID=19), [_death ward_](/Spells.aspx?ID=64), [_passwall_](/Spells.aspx?ID=216); **Cantrips (6th)** [_dancing lights_](/Spells.aspx?ID=58), [_detect magic_](/Spells.aspx?ID=66), [_electric arc_](/Spells.aspx?ID=97), [_prestidigitation_](/Spells.aspx?ID=229), [_read aura_](/Spells.aspx?ID=246) \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Ancient</title> **Primal Prepared Spells** DC 41, attack +36; as adult cloud dragon, plus **9th** [_heal_](/Spells.aspx?ID=148), [_storm of vengeance_](/Spells.aspx?ID=313); **8th** [_dispel magic_](/Spells.aspx?ID=78), [_moment of renewal_](/Spells.aspx?ID=201), [_punishing winds_](/Spells.aspx?ID=240); **7th** [_energy aegis_](/Spells.aspx?ID=100), [_plane shift_](/Spells.aspx?ID=222), [_unfettered pack_](/Spells.aspx?ID=350); **Cantrips (9th)** [_dancing lights_](/Spells.aspx?ID=58), [_detect magic_](/Spells.aspx?ID=66), [_electric arc_](/Spells.aspx?ID=97), [_prestidigitation_](/Spells.aspx?ID=229), [_read aura_](/Spells.aspx?ID=246)\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_4_RelatedCreatures.png\">Zanembis</title>\r\n\r\nWhile most cloud dragons prefer solitude and avoid confrontations, Zanembis is an excellent example of how failed dragonslaying attempts can create problems.
