Their sleek black scales and serpentine grace allow them to strike from hiding, and they are known for playing with their prey before finally finishing it. These creatures of shadowy energy and unwholesome appetites prefer the necrotic flesh of undead creatures to any other meal. This strange hunger can be of accidental benefit to nearby humanoid societies, but ultimately they hunt and kill undead creatures for the taste, rather than out of any desire to protect others from the undead. The benefit is always short-lived, however. When umbral dragons exhaust their preferred prey, they turn on whatever living creatures happen to be nearby. Umbral dragons sometimes go to great lengths to obtain their favorite meals, even creating undead creatures that they then feast upon.\n\n  For all their power, umbral dragons are uninterested in fair battles. When faced with foes that pose any kind of actual danger to them, umbral dragons flee into the shadows and seek to strike back through pawns or minions rather than risk their own lives. Their treasure hoards are varied and diverse, often augmented by loot stolen from crypts the dragons have turned into feeding grounds. They have a strong respect for and interest in traditions and heirlooms, and they often seek to augment their hoards with items of great value that have been handed down through the generations of those whose corpses and ghosts they've fed upon.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Adult Umbral Dragon](/Monsters.aspx?ID=635) (Creature 15), [Ancient Umbral Dragon](/Monsters.aspx?ID=636) (Creature 20), [Young Umbral Dragon](/Monsters.aspx?ID=634) (Creature 11)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_4_RelatedCreatures.png\">Ugothogo</title>\r\n\r\nDenizens of the Midnight Mountains in the Darklands worship the ancient umbral dragon Ugothogo as a deity.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Umbral Dragon Spellcasters</title>\r\n\r\nUmbral dragon spellcasters tend to cast the following spells. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Young</title> **Primal Prepared Spells** DC 29, attack +24; **4th** [_gaseous form_](/Spells.aspx?ID=129), [_hallucinatory terrain_](/Spells.aspx?ID=145), [_nightmare_](/Spells.aspx?ID=208); **3rd** [_bind undead_](/Spells.aspx?ID=22), [_blindness_](/Spells.aspx?ID=26), [_slow_](/Spells.aspx?ID=289); **2nd** [_death knell_](/Spells.aspx?ID=63), [_gentle repose_](/Spells.aspx?ID=131), [_humanoid form_](/Spells.aspx?ID=153); **1st** [_charm_](/Spells.aspx?ID=34), [_item facade_](/Spells.aspx?ID=166), [_ray of enfeeblement_](/Spells.aspx?ID=244); **Cantrips (4th)** [_chill touch_](/Spells.aspx?ID=35), [_ghost sound_](/Spells.aspx?ID=132), [_ray of frost_](/Spells.aspx?ID=245), [_read aura_](/Spells.aspx?ID=246), [_sigil_](/Spells.aspx?ID=286) \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Adult</title> **Primal Prepared Spells** DC 35, attack +30; as young umbral dragon, plus **6th** [_dominate_](/Spells.aspx?ID=87), [_true seeing_](/Spells.aspx?ID=344), [_vampiric exsanguination_](/Spells.aspx?ID=353); **5th** [_black tentacles_](/Spells.aspx?ID=23), [_shadow blast_](/Spells.aspx?ID=273), [_shadow siphon_](/Spells.aspx?ID=274); **Cantrips (6th)** [_chill touch_](/Spells.aspx?ID=35), [_ghost sound_](/Spells.aspx?ID=132), [_ray of frost_](/Spells.aspx?ID=245), [_read aura_](/Spells.aspx?ID=246), [_sigil_](/Spells.aspx?ID=286) \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Ancient</title> **Primal Prepared Spells** DC 41, attack +38; as adult umbral dragon, plus **9th** [_disjunction_](/Spells.aspx?ID=77), [_massacre_](/Spells.aspx?ID=186), [_weird_](/Spells.aspx?ID=375); **8th** [_disappearance_](/Spells.aspx?ID=73), [_horrid wilting_](/Spells.aspx?ID=152), [_maze_](/Spells.aspx?ID=187); **7th** [_eclipse burst_](/Spells.aspx?ID=96), [_mask of terror_](/Spells.aspx?ID=185), [_plane shift_](/Spells.aspx?ID=222); **Cantrips (9th)** [_chill touch_](/Spells.aspx?ID=35), [_ghost sound_](/Spells.aspx?ID=132), [_ray of frost_](/Spells.aspx?ID=245), [_read aura_](/Spells.aspx?ID=246), [_sigil_](/Spells.aspx?ID=286)\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature Family Group\">Dragon, Primal</title>\r\n\r\n**Related Families**\r\n[Dragon, Brine](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=175), [Dragon, Cloud](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=176), [Dragon, Crystal](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=177), [Dragon, Magma](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=178)",
