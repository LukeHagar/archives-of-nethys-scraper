Their temperament and tendency for violent outbursts ensure that the typical magma dragon lives a solitary life, with hatchlings often bickering or fighting to establish dominance among themselves before they leave the nest. A magma dragon always has a reason for their outbursts and can always justify their sudden turns in mood, yet they rarely feel the need to do so.\n\n  Magma dragons build lairs within volcanically active mountains or deep underground amid vast lakes of bubbling magma. As with all true dragons, magma dragons keep hoards of treasure, but the nature of their searing lairs limits the type of valuables they collect to metals, gems, and items capable of resisting the heat of a volcano's core.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Adult Magma Dragon](/Monsters.aspx?ID=470) (Creature 13), [Adult Magma Dragon](/Monsters.aspx?ID=632) (Creature 13), [Ancient Magma Dragon](/Monsters.aspx?ID=471) (Creature 18), [Ancient Magma Dragon](/Monsters.aspx?ID=633) (Creature 18), [Young Magma Dragon](/Monsters.aspx?ID=469) (Creature 9), [Young Magma Dragon](/Monsters.aspx?ID=631) (Creature 9)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Magma Dragon Spellcasters</title>\r\n\r\nMagma dragon spellcasters tend to cast the following spells. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Young</title> **Primal Prepared Spells** DC 28, attack +20; **4th** [_stoneskin_](/Spells.aspx?ID=312), [_wall of fire_](/Spells.aspx?ID=362); **3rd** [_haste_](/Spells.aspx?ID=147), [_slow_](/Spells.aspx?ID=289), [_stinking cloud_](/Spells.aspx?ID=309); **2nd** [_glitterdust_](/Spells.aspx?ID=136), [_obscuring mist_](/Spells.aspx?ID=210), [_restore senses_](/Spells.aspx?ID=259); **1st** [_air bubble_](/Spells.aspx?ID=5), [_grease_](/Spells.aspx?ID=140), [_pass without trace_](/Spells.aspx?ID=215); **Cantrips (4th)** [_detect magic_](/Spells.aspx?ID=66), [_prestidigitation_](/Spells.aspx?ID=229), [_produce flame_](/Spells.aspx?ID=236), [_read aura_](/Spells.aspx?ID=246), [_tanglefoot_](/Spells.aspx?ID=330) \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Adult</title> **Primal Prepared Spells** DC 33, attack +25; as young magma dragon, plus **6th** [_fire seeds_](/Spells.aspx?ID=117), [_true seeing_](/Spells.aspx?ID=344); **5th** [_cloudkill_](/Spells.aspx?ID=42), [_elemental form_](/Spells.aspx?ID=98), [_flame strike_](/Spells.aspx?ID=120); **4th** [_hallucinatory terrain_](/Spells.aspx?ID=145); **Cantrips (6th)** [_detect magic_](/Spells.aspx?ID=66), [_prestidigitation_](/Spells.aspx?ID=229), [_produce flame_](/Spells.aspx?ID=236), [_read aura_](/Spells.aspx?ID=246), [_tanglefoot_](/Spells.aspx?ID=330) \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Ancient</title> **Primal Prepared Spells** DC 42, attack +34; as adult magma dragon, plus **8th** [_earthquake_](/Spells.aspx?ID=95), [_horrid wilting_](/Spells.aspx?ID=152), [_power word stun_](/Spells.aspx?ID=228); **7th** [_fiery body_](/Spells.aspx?ID=115), [_plane shift_](/Spells.aspx?ID=222), [_volcanic eruption_](/Spells.aspx?ID=360); **6th** [_flesh to stone_](/Spells.aspx?ID=123); **Cantrips (8th)** [_detect magic_](/Spells.aspx?ID=66), [_prestidigitation_](/Spells.aspx?ID=229), [_produce flame_](/Spells.aspx?ID=236), [_read aura_](/Spells.aspx?ID=246), [_tanglefoot_](/Spells.aspx?ID=330)\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_4_RelatedCreatures.png\">Moschabbatt</title>\r\n\r\nThe ancient magma dragon Moschabbatt dwells in a vast chamber hidden within Droskar's Crag, the largest volcano in the Inner Sea region.
