The key to understanding green dragons is to understand their obsession with knowledge and self-discipline. Any careful approach that takes advantage of a green dragon's fixations may end in a diplomatic outcome, but any misstep or slight can provoke a savage attack. Like most chromatic dragons, green dragons do not suffer fools—and the threshold for what they consider foolish is very low.\n\n  Though more open than their chromatic cousins to dealing with other creatures and dragons, green dragons prefer an isolated and quiet life. They tend to lair in the most forbidding parts of a forest, surrounded by tangled thickets, or else at the heart of some dismal gulch. If the terrain is suitable, some green dragons make their home in natural caves, which they expand to suit their needs.\n\n  Green dragons' pride leads them to see to the preservation of their forest homes. They feel that a verdant and lush forest is something that they alone have cultivated. This leads some green dragons to follow the path of druidism, though most prefer to study the arcane arts and occult lore. Most of them delve deeply into one particular field of study, and correspond with other scholars in the field by adopting a pen name that hides their true nature. Regardless of their chosen focus, green dragons seek to improve themselves, and their desire for knowledge makes them more likely to deal diplomatically with other creatures in order to obtain new information.\n\n  Their hoards are typically well kept, organized, and filled with tomes of lore and scrolls of magic along with antiquities they collect for their own inscrutable reasons. Many of these treasures come from across the globe, and many an adventurer has survived an encounter with a green dragon by stroking its ego and plying it with rare artifacts or lost lore from ancient cultures.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Adult Green Dragon](/Monsters.aspx?ID=134) (Creature 12), [Ancient Green Dragon](/Monsters.aspx?ID=135) (Creature 17), [Young Green Dragon](/Monsters.aspx?ID=133) (Creature 8)\n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature Family Group\">Dragon, Chromatic</title>\r\n\r\n**Related Families**\r\n[Dragon, Black](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=165), [Dragon, Blue](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=166), [Dragon, Red](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=168), [Dragon, White](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=169)",
