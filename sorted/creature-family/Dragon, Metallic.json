Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals' lives—and of their passing—always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don't seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water—though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other.\n\n In addition to metallic dragons and their [chromatic counterparts](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=34), other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes. Countless other types of dragons are sure to exist, including dragons on far-fiung planes of existence and, it is rumored, primeval dragons who soar between the stars. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Shape-Changing Dragons</title> Some dragons can take humanoid form, allowing them to infiltrate settlements or influence others without revealing their true nature. They gain the following ability:<br /> **Change Shape** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([arcane](/Traits.aspx?ID=11), [concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32), [polymorph](/Traits.aspx?ID=127), [transmutation](/Traits.aspx?ID=157)); The dragon takes on the appearance of any Small or Medium humanoid. This doesn't change its Speed or attack and damage modifiers with its Strikes, but might change the damage type its Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning). \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Metallic Dragon Spellcasters</title> Each type of metallic dragon features a sidebar on spellcasting dragons of that kind. To make a metallic dragon spellcaster, remove the dragon's Draconic Frenzy and Draconic Momentum abilities, and give it the spells outlined in its sidebar. You can swap out any number of these with other arcane spells, provided you keep the same number of spells for each level. You might also want to increase the dragon's Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier by 1 or 2 to reflect its mastery of magic. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Metallic Dragons on Golarion</title> Metallic dragons are found throughout the Inner Sea region, especially in pockets of wilderness where they can carve a hideout and then take action on political and social issues, both in their local area and on a wider scale. Their everlasting war with chromatic dragons keeps them in close proximity to their evil brethren; in regions where metallic and chromatic dragons' territories intersect, humanoid settlements get caught in the crossfire, and villagers and city-dwellers alike rightfully fear for their own safety.\n\n Silver dragons lair in abundance around the cold wastes west of Mendev, as a consequence of the days when they joined thousands of crusaders who marched headlong into the demon-infested Worldwound. Bronze dragons are abundant in Taldor, and many copper dragons lair in the wilds of Andoran, where they wage war alongside other freedom fighters to overthrow devils in the neighboring empire of Cheliax. Perhaps the most extreme example of a metallic dragon taking part in human affairs is on the island nation of Hermea, where Mengkare—an ancient gold wyrm—has begun a grand social experiment he calls “the Glorious Endeavor.” Ostensibly intended to create a future utopia on Golarion, this highly controversial experiment is instead regarded by many as a cruel and unusual form of eugenics.\n\n<title level=\"2\">Group Families</title>\r\n[Dragon, Brass](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=170), [Dragon, Bronze](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=171), [Dragon, Copper](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=172), [Dragon, Gold](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=173), [Dragon, Silver](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=174)\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_4_RelatedCreatures.png\">Apsu</title>\r\n\r\nApsu, the Waybringer, is the god of good dragons, leadership, and peace.
