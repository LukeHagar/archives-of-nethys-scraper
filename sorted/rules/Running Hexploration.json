Each day, the PCs decide how they plan on exploring, either learning more about their current hex or traversing a new hex. They do this by declaring one or more hexploration activities for the day. These activities take two forms: group or individual. The number of hexploration activities a group can accomplish each day is based on the Speed of their slowest member. If a group is willing to split up, faster members can perform more hexploration activities based on their own Speed, but such a decision may be deadly given the threat of random encounters. A group moving at a Speed of 10 feet or less is so slow it can’t even traverse an open hex in a single day; it takes such a group 2 days for each hexploration activity. \n\n## Table 3–6: Hexploration Activities Per Day\n<row gap=\"tiny\">\n<table> <tr><td>**Speed**</td><td>**Activities per Day**</td></tr> <tr><td>10 feet or less</td><td>1/2</td></tr> <tr><td>15–25 feet</td><td>1</td></tr> <tr><td>30–40 feet</td><td>2</td></tr> <tr><td>45–55 feet</td><td>3</td></tr> <tr><td>60 feet or more</td><td>4</td></tr> </table></row> This rate assumes the PCs are taking time to camp and rest at healthy intervals. When a new day of hexploration begins, the group can decide to take a forced march as long as no one in the group is fatigued. Doing so allows them to gain an extra Travel activity (or perform a full Travel activity each day if their Speed is 10 feet or less), but this is the only activity they can perform that day. A character can participate in a forced march safely for a number of days equal to the character’s Constitution modifier (minimum 1 day). Any additional days of forced march make the character fatigued until they spend an entire day of downtime resting.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1273\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1274\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1276\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1277\" />",
