An area effect always has a point of origin and extends out from that point. There are four types of areas: emanations, bursts, cones, and lines. When you’re playing in encounter mode and using a grid, areas are measured in the same way as movement (page 463), but areas’ distances are never reduced or affected by difficult terrain (page 475) or lesser cover (page 476). You can use the diagrams below as common reference templates for areas, rather than measuring squares each time. Many area effects describe only the effects on creatures in the area. The GM determines any effects to the environment and unattended objects.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Rules/Rules354.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-355\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-356\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-357\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-358\" />",
