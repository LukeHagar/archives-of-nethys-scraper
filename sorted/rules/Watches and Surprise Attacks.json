Spending time on watch also interrupts sleep, so a night’s schedule needs to account for everyone’s time on guard duty. Table 10–3: Watches and Rest indicates how long the group needs to set aside for rest, assuming everyone gets a rotating watch assignment of equal length.\n\n If a surprise encounter would occur during rest, you can roll a die to randomly determine which character is on watch at the time. All characters roll initiative; sleeping characters typically roll Perception with a –4 status penalty for being unconscious. They don’t automatically wake up when rolling initiative, but they might roll a Perception check to wake up at the start of their turn due to noise. If a savvy enemy waits for a particularly vulnerable character to take watch before attacking, the attack can happen on that character’s watch automatically. However, you might have the ambusher attempt a Stealth check against the Perception DCs of all characters to see if anyone noticed its approach.\n\n## Table 10-3: Watches and Rest\n<row gap=\"tiny\">\n<table> <tr><td>**Party Size**</td><td>**Total Time**</td><td>**Duration of Each Watch**</td></tr> <tr><td>2</td><td>16 hours</td><td>8 hours</td></tr> <tr><td>3</td><td>12 hours</td><td>4 hours</td></tr> <tr><td>4</td><td>10 hours, 40 minutes</td><td>2 hours, 40 minutes</td></tr> <tr><td>5</td><td>10 hours</td><td>2 hours</td></tr> <tr><td>6</td><td>9 hours, 36 minutes</td><td>1 hour, 36 minutes</td></tr> </table></row>\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>",
