A lower-level item might give such a bonus temporarily, but keep track to make sure the item isn’t effectively permanent. If a character typically picks three or fewer locks a day, there’s no difference between a +2 item bonus to pick all locks and an activation that gives a +2 item bonus to Pick a Lock three times per day. For attack bonuses, AC, and saves, the minimums match _magic weapons_ and _magic armor_. You can have other items with these bonuses (like [_handwraps of mighty blows_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=441)), but keep in mind they compete with fundamental runes. Skill bonuses come on a wider range of items. Some are more broadly useful, so an Athletics item might be more expensive than an equivalent Society item. Gaining a bonus to Perception is especially valuable compared to gaining a bonus to a skill. Just because an item is the minimum level for its bonus doesn’t mean the bonus should be the item’s only power. The item can and should have an additional interesting power beyond the bonus. Likewise, an item can come at a higher level than the minimum, but if it’s much higher, its abilities start to compete with the next bonus. \n\n## Table 2–17: Levels for Permanent Item Bonuses\n<row gap=\"tiny\">\n<table> <tr><td>**Statistic**</td><td>**+1**</td><td>**+2**</td><td>**+3**</td></tr> <tr><td>Attack bonus</td><td>2</td><td>10</td><td>16</td></tr> <tr><td>AC</td><td>5</td><td>11</td><td>18</td></tr> <tr><td>Save (resilient rune)</td><td>8</td><td>14</td><td>20</td></tr> <tr><td>Skill/Perception</td><td>3</td><td>9</td><td>17*</td></tr> </table> * This is also the minimum level for apex items.</row>\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>",
