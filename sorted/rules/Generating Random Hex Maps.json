Then decide the type of terrain for that starting point or roll it on Table 3–4: Random Terrain Type. From that point onward, let the players decide which direction they travel. If they enter an unexplored hex, generate that hex by rolling 1d20 on Table 3–4 and Table 3–5: Random Terrain Feature to determine a type and element for that hex. Apply common sense when producing terrain in this way. Unless magic is involved, it is unlikely a patch of arctic ice would appear in the heart of a desert—though figuring out a way for that to occur could lead to an interesting encounter or subplot later on. \n\n## Table 3–4: Random Terrain Type\n<row gap=\"tiny\">\n<table> <tr><td>**1d20** </td><td>**Result**</td></tr> <tr><td>1–3</td><td>Plains</td></tr> <tr><td>4–5</td><td>Desert</td></tr> <tr><td>6–7</td><td>Aquatic (lake, sea, or ocean)</td></tr> <tr><td>8–9</td><td>Mountain</td></tr> <tr><td>10–11</td><td>Forest</td></tr> <tr><td>12</td><td>Swamp</td></tr> <tr><td>13</td><td>Arctic</td></tr> <tr><td>14–20</td><td>Match the previous hex</td></tr> </table></row> \n\n## Table 3–5: Random Terrain Feature\n<row gap=\"tiny\">\n<table> <tr><td>**1d20**</td><td>**Result**</td></tr> <tr><td>1–3</td><td>**Landmark** A feature of some significance that distinguishes the hex as noteworthy.</td></tr> <tr><td>4–6</td><td>**Secret** The hex contains a secret the party uncovers upon exploring the hex.</td></tr> <tr><td>7–9</td><td>**Resource** The hex contains some valuable resource appropriate to the terrain.</td></tr> <tr><td>10–20</td><td>**Standard** A standard representation of the terrain type.</td></tr> </table></row>\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>",
