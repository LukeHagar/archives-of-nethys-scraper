You might adjust the difficulty based on the specifics of the structure and environment. \n\n### Demolishing\n A character might want to smash their way through a door, a window, or certain walls. The Hardness, Hit Point, and Broken Threshold values provided in the table below are based on the material the structure is typically made out of, so a portcullis made of iron, for example, has a higher Hardness than one of wood. For more on damaging objects, see page 272. Strong walls, such as well-maintained masonry or hewn stone, can’t be broken without dedicated work and proper tools. Getting through such walls requires downtime.\n\n## Doors, Gates, and Walls\n<row gap=\"tiny\">\n<table> <tr><td>**Door**</td><td>**Climb DC**</td><td>**Hardness, HP (BT)**</td></tr> <tr><td>Wood</td><td>20</td><td>10, 40 (20)</td></tr> <tr><td>Stone</td><td>30</td><td>14, 56 (28)</td></tr> <tr><td>Reinforced wood</td><td>15</td><td>15, 60 (30)</td></tr> <tr><td>Iron</td><td>30</td><td>18, 72 (36)</td></tr> <tr><td>**Wall**</td><td>**Climb DC**</td><td>**Hardness, HP (BT)**</td></tr> <tr><td>Crumbling masonry</td><td>15</td><td>10, 40 (20)</td></tr> <tr><td>Wooden slats</td><td>15</td><td>10, 40 (20)</td></tr> <tr><td>Masonry</td><td>20</td><td>14, 56 (28)</td></tr> <tr><td>Hewn stone</td><td>30</td><td>14, 56 (28)</td></tr> <tr><td>Iron</td><td>40</td><td>18, 72 (36)</td></tr> <tr><td>**Portcullis**</td><td>**Climb DC**</td><td>**Hardness, HP (BT)**</td></tr> <tr><td>Wood</td><td>10</td><td>10, 40 (20)</td></tr> <tr><td>Iron</td><td>10</td><td>18, 72 (36)</td></tr> </table></row> \n\n### Forcing Open\n Structures that can be opened—such as doors, gates, and windows—can be Forced Open using Athletics. This is usually necessary only if they’re locked or stuck. The DC to Force Open a structure uses the Thievery DC of its lock but adjusts it to be very hard (increasing the DC by 5). If there’s no lock, use the following table; when lifting a portcullis, use the lock DC or the DC from the table, whichever is higher.\n\n## Forcing Open\n<row gap=\"tiny\">\n<table> <tr><td>**Structure**</td><td>**Force Open DC**</td></tr> <tr><td>Stuck door or window</td><td>15</td></tr> <tr><td>Exceptionally stuck</td><td>20</td></tr> <tr><td>Lift wooden portcullis</td><td>20</td></tr> <tr><td>Lift iron portcullis</td><td>30</td></tr> <tr><td>Bend metal bars</td><td>30</td></tr> </table> </row>\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-618\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-619\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-620\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-621\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-622\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-623\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-624\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-625\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-627\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-628\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-629\" />",
