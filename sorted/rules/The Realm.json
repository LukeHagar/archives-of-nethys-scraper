It's in this village that the simulacra who play the role of servants in Harrowheart “live,” and all the food and drink served in Harrowheart's dining halls come from the surrounding farmlands. Beyond these fertile plains lie scorching deserts, trackless swamps, a deep lake, and a sprawling forest. Surrounding them all is a range of looming mountains.\n\n The PCs are free to explore as they see fit, and as they epitomize more cards, the options and activities they can pursue in these terrains increases, but until those options are epitomized, there's not much more to do in the wilds surrounding Harrowheart other than sightsee.\n\n In order to pursue activities in these outlying terrains, a PC must travel to the required terrain. Resolve travel using Exploration Mode, and use the map of the Harrow Court on page 70 to calculate time spent traveling. Sometimes, a PC may find themselves having to spend the night outside Harrowheart's comforts. In these instances, the character must use [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) to [Subsist](/Actions.aspx?ID=27). (As with the dining rooms, sustenance gathered while Subsisting is filling, even while the food itself cannot exist outside of the demiplane.) Each terrain entry below notes additional features a PC faces when traversing the terrain. The DC listed in parentheses after the terrain's name indicates the Survival DC to Subsist in that terrain.\n\n **Desert (DC 30)**: The desert is [difficult terrain](/Rules.aspx?ID=459). Daytime temperatures are [severe heat](/Rules.aspx?ID=642), while nighttime temperatures are mild cold.\n\n **Farmland (DC 10)**: Temperatures in the farmland are normal during day and night.\n\n **Forest (DC 25)**: The forest is difficult terrain. Temperatures are normal during day and night.\n\n **Lake (DC 25)**: Small boats and rafts are commonplace along the lake's shores. There's always an available watercraft within no more than a ten-minute walk along the water's edge.
