Choose and implement your character’s ancestry and background as normal. Then, when you get to the step of choosing a class, select two classes and add everything from each class except Hit Points and starting skills: initial proficiencies, class features, class feats, extra skill feats and skill increases for rogues, and so on. As always, use the highest proficiency granted for a given statistic. For instance, if one class gave you expert proficiency in Will saves and the other gave you master proficiency in Will saves, you would be a master in Will saves.\n\n Use only the higher Hit Points per level from the two classes. For starting skills, apply the skills automatically granted by each class, and then apply the larger number of additional skills. For instance, a [cleric](/Classes.aspx?ID=5) of [Shelyn](/Deities.aspx?ID=17)/[ranger](/Classes.aspx?ID=9) would gain Hit Points equal to 10 + their Constitution modifier per level, start with the trained proficiency rank in [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) and [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) from ranger and [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13) and either [Crafting](/Skills.aspx?ID=4) or [Performance](/Skills.aspx?ID=12) from cleric, and then gain a number of additional skills of their choice equal to 4 + their Intelligence modifier, since the ranger provides the trained proficiency rank in more additional skills than the cleric does (this example doesn’t include any skills they gained from their background or other sources). This character would also have the deity, divine spellcasting, divine font, and doctrine class features from cleric plus the Hunt Prey, hunter’s edge, and ranger feat class features from ranger.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1330\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1331\" />",
