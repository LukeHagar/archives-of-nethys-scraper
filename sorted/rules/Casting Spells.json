Casting a Spell is a special activity that takes a number of actions defined by the spell. When you Cast a Spell, your spellcasting creates obvious visual manifestations of the gathering magic, although feats such as [Conceal Spell](/Feats.aspx?ID=640) and [Melodious Spell](/Feats.aspx?ID=189) can help hide such manifestations or otherwise prevent observers from noticing that you are casting. \n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-72\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Metamagic</title>\r\n\r\nMany spellcasters can gain access to metamagic actions, typically by selecting metamagic feats. Actions with the [metamagic](/Traits.aspx?ID=107) trait tweak the properties of your spells, changing their range, damage, or any number of other properties. You must use a metamagic action directly before the spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions, reactions, and additional metamagic actions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell’s effect, not of the metamagic action itself.  \r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-281\" />",
