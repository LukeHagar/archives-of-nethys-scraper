The simplest solution is to simply gloss over these parts of the Adventure Path—to have the battles play out in the narrative background and assume that as long as the PCs continue to persevere, their kingdom does as well. If you opt for this simple solution but are using the kingdom management rules from Appendix 3, then at the start of any [Kingdom turn](/Rules.aspx?ID=1794) during which warfare took place, the kingdom gains 1d6 Unrest and increases one Ruin of the party's choice by 1 point.\n\n But if you want to expand the kingdom rules to include a method of resolving mass combat in play as downtime events, read on! These rules provide an abstract system for warfare that lets you play out a complex battle as a downtime encounter using victory points. These rules are not intended to accurately represent complex wars, but instead seek to incorporate warfare into a campaign that stays primarily focused on traditional, small-scale adventuring and roleplaying.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1846\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1861\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1863\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1864\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1876\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1878\" />",
