These are called relics, and owning one can define a character more than any other magic item could.\n\n Relics begin as a simple item, called a relic seed, which is little more than a functional item with a minor magical effect associated with it. As the owner of the relic grows in power, so does the relic. It develops gifts, which are new magical abilities and activations. These abilities might be themed to the relic, the character, or the nature of the campaign. If a relic is passed to another character, this process begins anew, sometimes granting the same abilities again over time, but possibly unlocking entirely new powers. If someone else takes the relic from its owner, it usually works for a while, though it might lose its power incrementally over time if not returned to its owner. How the relic changes in such a circumstance is up to you, and should fit the story.\n\n The decision to add relics to the game is entirely up to you as the GM. If you decide to add them, you’ll need to adjust treasure somewhat. It’s also wise to consider how many players you expect to end up with relics. Will they each get one? Or will there be just one or two tied to the theme of the campaign?\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Player-Driven Relics</title>\r\n\r\nThough these rules assume you as the GM are providing relic gifts as a form of treasure with input from the players, you can instead have the players make all the decisions for their relics. Encourage the players to choose different styles of items and aspects to match their characters’ themes, rather than simply choosing the most powerful combination of options. Have players describe how their relic gets more powerful in the story. What acts from previous sessions lent the relic power? What special meditations or practices did they perform to unlock new gifts? How does it feel to have the relic grow?\n\n As the item and the character level up, the player chooses which gifts the item gets from the list as a part of character advancement. You still adjust treasure as normal for incorporating relics into your game. In fact, if the player tries to optimize the combinations, they will likely be more powerful than under the standard method.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1097\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1100\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1101\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1102\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1103\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1104\" />",
