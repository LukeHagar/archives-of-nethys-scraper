When the PCs create their kingdom, they must decide if their kingdom aims to become famous or infamous—the choice is largely cosmetic but does impact where and how you gain points in either. For example, some structures can grant these points when built, but only if their Fame/Infamy trait matches that of the kingdom.\n\n Kingdoms initially have a maximum of 3 Fame/ Infamy points at any one time. These can be used in one of two ways. Neither of these is an action, but the entire party must agree to spend the point. All Fame/ Infamy points left unspent at the end of a Kingdom turn are lost.\n\n **Spend 1 Fame/Infamy Point** to reroll a Kingdom skill check. You must use the second result. This is a fortune effect (which means you can't use more than 1 Fame/ Infamy point on a check).\n\n **Spend all your Fame/Infamy Points** to stave off the effects of anarchy or ruination. You can do this if a kingdom's Unrest would result in anarchy (in which case your Unrest is instead set at 1 point below the value at which anarchy occurs), or if an increase to a Ruin would increase the ruin penalty (in which case the Ruin is instead set at one point below the value at which a ruin penalty would accrue).\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1793\" />",
