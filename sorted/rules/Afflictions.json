And some—curses being the most notorious—exist solely to cause harm to others.\n\n Afflictions strike creatures with potent and often escalating results. This section presents a variety of curses, diseases, and drugs for use in your game. A broad sampling of poisons can be found beginning on page 550 of the Core Rulebook, and the rules for afflictions start on 457.\n\n Depending on the tone of the campaign, the GM might want to roll secret saving throws for PCs affected by an affliction. This is particularly effective when the affliction is an element within a survival or horror game, or when it’s part of a mystery.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1114\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1115\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1116\" />",
