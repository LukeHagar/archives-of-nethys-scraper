Since moving through a settlement requires a character to follow twisting roads, navigate crowds, or endure minor distractions along the way, it takes 15 minutes to move from one lot to an adjacent lot, or to cross a border (including exiting the settlement). If the settlement has [Paved Streets](/KMStructures.aspx?ID=47), this travel time is reduced to 5 minutes.
