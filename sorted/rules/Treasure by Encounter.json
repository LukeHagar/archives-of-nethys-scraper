If you need to select treasure for a single encounter, such as in a sandbox game, you can use the table above. It takes the treasure budget for each level from [Table 10–9](/Rules.aspx?ID=581) of the _Core Rulebook_ and breaks that down per encounter based on the encounter threat, similar to how XP varies by threat. The final column shows extra treasure you should award if you build an entire level this way. Unlike the standard table, this doesn't include items by item level, as the value doesn't cleanly break down for most single encounters. It's recommended you still give out those permanent items, but you'll need to borrow from other encounters' treasure to account for their value. Include encounters against creatures without treasure to account for this.\n\n## Table 5-3: Treasure by Encounter\n<row gap=\"tiny\">\n<table> <tr><td>**Level**</td><td>**Total Treasure per Level**</td><td>**Low**</td><td>**Moderate**</td><td>**Severe**</td><td>**Extreme**</td><td>**Extra Treasure**</td></tr> <tr><td>1</td><td>175 gp</td><td>13 gp</td><td>18 gp</td><td>26 gp</td><td>35 gp</td><td>35 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>2</td><td>300 gp</td><td>23 gp</td><td>30 gp</td><td>45 gp</td><td>60 gp</td><td>60 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>3</td><td>500 gp</td><td>38 gp</td><td>50 gp</td><td>75 gp</td><td>100 gp</td><td>100 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>4</td><td>850 gp</td><td>65 gp</td><td>85 gp</td><td>130 gp</td><td>170 gp</td><td>170 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>5</td><td>1,350 gp</td><td>100 gp</td><td>135 gp</td><td>200 gp</td><td>270 gp</td><td>270 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>6</td><td>2,000 gp</td><td>150 gp</td><td>200 gp</td><td>300 gp</td><td>400 gp</td><td>400 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>7</td><td>2,900 gp</td><td>220 gp</td><td>290 gp</td><td>440 gp</td><td>580 gp</td><td>580 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>8</td><td>4,000 gp</td><td>300 gp</td><td>400 gp</td><td>600 gp</td><td>800 gp</td><td>800 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>9</td><td>5,700 gp</td><td>430 gp</td><td>570 gp</td><td>860 gp</td><td>1,140 gp</td><td>1,140 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>10</td><td>8,000 gp</td><td>600 gp</td><td>800 gp</td><td>1,200 gp</td><td>1,600 gp</td><td>1,600 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>11</td><td>11,500 gp</td><td>865 gp</td><td>1,150 gp</td><td>1,725 gp</td><td>2,300 gp</td><td>2,300 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>12</td><td>16,500 gp</td><td>1,250 gp</td><td>1,650 gp</td><td>2,475 gp</td><td>3,300 gp</td><td>3,300 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>13</td><td>25,000 gp</td><td>1,875 gp</td><td>2,500 gp</td><td>3,750 gp</td><td>5,000 gp</td><td>5,000 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>14</td><td>36,500 gp</td><td>2,750 gp</td><td>3,650 gp</td><td>5,500 gp</td><td>7,300 gp</td><td>7,300 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>15</td><td>54,500 gp</td><td>4,100 gp</td><td>5,450 gp</td><td>8,200 gp</td><td>10,900 gp</td><td>10,900 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>16</td><td>82,500 gp</td><td>6,200 gp</td><td>8,250 gp</td><td>12,400 gp</td><td>16,500 gp</td><td>16,500 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>17</td><td>128,000 gp</td><td>9,600 gp</td><td>12,800 gp</td><td>19,200 gp</td><td>25,600 gp</td><td>25,600 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>18</td><td>208,000 gp</td><td>15,600 gp</td><td>20,800 gp</td><td>31,200 gp</td><td>41,600 gp</td><td>41,600 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>19</td><td>355,000 gp</td><td>26,600 gp</td><td>35,500 gp</td><td>53,250 gp</td><td>71,000 gp</td><td>71,000 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>20</td><td>490,000 gp</td><td>36,800 gp</td><td>49,000 gp</td><td>73,500 gp</td><td>98,000 gp</td><td>98,000 gp</td></tr> </table></row>\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>",
