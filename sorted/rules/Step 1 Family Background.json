You might have a biological family, adopted family, stepfamily, or any other kind and combination you choose; family bonds come in all types. To determine the number of family members you grew up with as an active part of your life, roll 1d% on the following table. Use the medium family for most ancestries, small if you’re a [half-elf](/Ancestries.aspx?ID=7) or [half-orc](/Ancestries.aspx?ID=8), and large if you’re a [goblin](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=55) or [halfling](/Ancestries.aspx?ID=5). For ancestries other than those in the _Core Rulebook_, use the column that best suits the ancestry. It’s up to you whether these family members are parents, siblings, grandparents, or other close relatives. \n\n## Table 4-5: Family Size\n<row gap=\"tiny\">\n<table> <tr><td>**d%**</td><td>**Small Family**</td><td>**Medium Family**</td><td>**Large Family**</td></tr> <tr><td>1–4</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr> <tr><td>5–8</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr> <tr><td>9–20</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>2</td></tr> <tr><td>21–34</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>3</td></tr> <tr><td>35–39</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr> <tr><td>40–50</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>4</td></tr> <tr><td>51–60</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr> <tr><td>61–65</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>5</td></tr> <tr><td>66–69</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr> <tr><td>70–78</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr> <tr><td>79–80</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>6</td></tr> <tr><td>81–87</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr> <tr><td>88–90</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr> <tr><td>91–93</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td></tr> <tr><td>94–95</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>7</td></tr> <tr><td>96–97</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>7</td></tr> <tr><td>98–99</td><td>7</td><td>7</td><td>8+</td></tr> <tr><td>100</td><td>8+</td><td>8+</td><td>8+</td></tr> </table> </row> \n<ul><li>If you grew up with no family, you had to learn to survive on your own.
