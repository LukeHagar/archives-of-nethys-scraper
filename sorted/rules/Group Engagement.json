When you can, combine multiple people’s tasks into one. For instance, if one PC wants to [Earn Income](/Actions.aspx?ID=23) with [Performance](/Skills.aspx?ID=12) and another wants to offer their services as a medic, you might say that a traveling caravan is stopping briefly, seeking entertainment and treatment for diseases and injuries their group suffered on the road. That means you can put both PCs in the same scene. You can also look for downtime activities that affect multiple characters’ interests. For instance, if the rogue’s contact at the thieves’ guild wants a special magical cloak, a different PC might [Craft](/Actions.aspx?ID=43) that cloak. PCs can help each other more directly. For instance, if the barbarian’s player doesn’t plan to do anything in downtime, you might let the barbarian [Aid](/Actions.aspx?ID=75) another character in crafting weapons—feeding the forge and working the bellows, for instance.\n\n If a player really isn’t interested in downtime, they might not want to engage at all. In that case, it’s best to shorten the time you spend on downtime and give their actions a one-sentence description. If other players want a deeper downtime experience, consider extending game sessions or running side sessions for just those players.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>",
