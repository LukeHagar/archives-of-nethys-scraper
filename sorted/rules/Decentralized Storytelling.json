Now we’re talking about decentralized storytelling, the least traditional approach we’ll cover here.\n\n In this approach, one of your biggest jobs is asking questions or giving prompts. “When you open the door, what’s beyond?” “How does the king react to Lem’s taunt?” You can direct your questions to individual players, leave them open to all, and put forth your own suggestions.\n\n This approach works best when players are comfortable with one another and willing to both take responsibility in building the story and accept that some of their ideas will go unused.
