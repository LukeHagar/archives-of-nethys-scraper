The more each card of the _Deck of Destiny_ ached to return to the fold, the more the quintessence within them began to build power. When one card from each of the deck's six suits were reunited, that power reached a mystical critical mass, resulting in the spontaneous creation of the Harrow Court—an event realized, at first, only by a precious few: the PCs themselves.\n\n In this Adventure Path, the Harrow Court serves as a home base for the PCs. Once they trigger the demiplane's creation, they'll continue to unlock expansions to the realm as they discover cards and “add” them to the Court, incarnating the card into the demiplane to alter its reality. While there's an implied order to the elements added to the demiplane (reflecting the order in which the cards are discovered during the adventure), which cards and what order they're brought to the Harrow Court is left entirely in the PCs' hands.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1981\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1987\" />",
