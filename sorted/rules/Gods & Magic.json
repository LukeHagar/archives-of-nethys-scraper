Pathfinder posits four traditions of magic: arcane, divine, occult, and primal. For a faithful character, divine magic is usually the most intrinsically appealing, as it reflects a direct connection to a deity.\n\n Divine magic is the intersection of the instinctual and faith-based vital essence that rules over life and death, and the otherworldly spiritual essence that forms the building blocks of all souls. It can close wounds in seconds, call down blasts of divine vengeance, uncover hidden truths, reveal the future, and even temporarily turn a devotee into an avatar of their god. The idea of divine might invokes images of a righteous crusader, but neutral and evil gods similarly imbue their devotees with power to further their own causes. The divine tradition also encompasses spiritual philosophies that don’t involve any specific deity, as well as pantheons of multiple deities.\n\n This book presents an in-depth look at the gods presented in [Chapter 8](/deities) of the _Pathfinder Core Rulebook_, including alternate domains and divine intercessions each god grants. Following that are 20 additional gods, with rules for playing their clerics and champions, including how to assume the forms of their mighty avatars. Following these entries, this book describes demigod pantheons, such as the Eldest and the empyreal lords, as well as spiritual philosophies, including the Green Faith and Sangpotshi. This book also includes exciting new domains, feats, items, spells, and weapons useful for many characters, not just clerics.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-799\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-800\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-801\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-807\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1385\" />",
