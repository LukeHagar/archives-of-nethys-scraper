As the name implies, subsystems are extensions of the main rules system that allow you to explore a particular topic or style of play at your table.\n\n Subsystems are a great way to add depth to aspects of your game that don't occur in combat but still have high stakes. This chapter begins with Victory Points, a structure that underlies much of the chapter, to help you build your own subsystems. Next are some of the most common subsystems you might need in your game, with advice on how to use and modify them.

Victory Points provides you a framework with which to build your own subsystems, detailing the fundamental structure that Pathfinder uses for its subsystems. Influence gives rules for more in-depth social encounters involving influencing NPCs. Research shows you how to build an interesting structure for scenes where PCs research information. Chases are designed to represent the fast-paced feel of movie chase scenes. Infiltration allows you to build infiltrations and heists where careful planning helps the PCs maintain an edge against their adversaries and pull off incredible capers. Reputation breathes life into the world around the PCs, as various groups of NPCs react favorably or unfavorably to the PCs actions, and PCs' status with those groups changes. Duels provides a simple architecture for one-on-one showdowns between adversaries. Leadership allows PCs to attract people to a cause, giving them cohorts and organizations to look after. Hexploration teaches you how to build exploration maps on a hexagonal grid to give your PCs the thrill of discovering secrets within uncharted or unfamiliar territory. Vehicles allows you to run encounters involving vehicles and capitalize on their potential to help PCs explore on a larger scale and at a faster pace.
