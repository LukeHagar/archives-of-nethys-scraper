At each new level, a kingdom improves attributes and focus areas beyond those provided by its basic background and the specific choices made at the time of its founding.\n\n At the end of a Kingdom turn, if the kingdom has at least 1,000 XP and has not yet reached its maximum level (see below), increase the kingdom's level by 1 and deduct 1,000 from its current XP total. (The kingdom's level can't increase by more than 1 on a single Kingdom turn.) Note the kingdom's new level on the kingdom sheet. If the kingdom has any leftover XP, they are retained and count toward gaining the next level.\n\n The kingdom's maximum level is equal to the party's level; it can never exceed the level of the PCs themselves. So, for example, if the PCs are still 1st level when the kingdom reaches 1,000 XP, the kingdom cannot level up yet; it will level up at the end of the first Kingdom turn after the PCs have reached 2nd level. (It's possible for a kingdom to accumulate a large reserve of XP, at which point the party's level effectively determines when that kingdom levels up rather than just XP accumulation. This is fine.)\n\n When your kingdom gains a level, each army you have gains a level as well. See [Appendix 3](/Rules.aspx?ID=1845) for additional details on armies.\n\n As the kingdom advances, it gains the abilities described on these two pages. Abilities gained at levels higher than first list the level at which they are gained next to their name.\n\n## Kingdom Advancement\n<row gap=\"tiny\">\n<table><tr><td>**Level**</td><td>**Control DC** </td><td>**Kingdom features**</td></tr> <tr><td>1</td><td>14</td><td>Charter, government, heartland, initial proficiencies, favored land, settlement construction (village)</td></tr> <tr><td>2</td><td>15</td><td>Kingdom feat</td></tr> <tr><td>3</td><td>16</td><td>Settlement construction (town), skill increase</td></tr> <tr><td>4</td><td>18</td><td>Expansion expert, fine living, Kingdom feat</td></tr> <tr><td>5</td><td>20</td><td>Ability boosts, ruin resistance, skill increase</td></tr> <tr><td>6</td><td>22</td><td>Kingdom feat</td></tr> <tr><td>7</td><td>23</td><td>Skill increase</td></tr> <tr><td>8</td><td>24</td><td>Experienced leadership +2, Kingdom feat, ruin resistance</td></tr> <tr><td>9</td><td>26</td><td>Expansion expert (Claim Hex 3 times/turn), settlement construction (city), skill increase</td></tr> <tr><td>10</td><td>27</td><td>Ability boosts, Kingdom feat, life of luxury</td></tr> <tr><td>11</td><td>28</td><td>Ruin resistance, skill increase</td></tr> <tr><td>12</td><td>30</td><td>Civic planning, Kingdom feat</td></tr> <tr><td>13</td><td>31</td><td>Skill increase</td></tr> <tr><td>14</td><td>32</td><td>Kingdom feat, ruin resistance</td></tr> <tr><td>15</td><td>34</td><td>Ability boosts, settlement construction (metropolis), skill increase</td></tr> <tr><td>16</td><td>35</td><td>Experienced leadership +3, Kingdom feat</td></tr> <tr><td>17</td><td>36</td><td>Ruin resistance, skill increase</td></tr> <tr><td>18</td><td>38</td><td>Kingdom feat</td></tr> <tr><td>19</td><td>39</td><td>Skill increase</td></tr> <tr><td>20</td><td>40</td><td>Ability boosts, envy of the world, Kingdom feat, ruin resistance</td></tr> </table></row>\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1759\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1760\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1761\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1762\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1763\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1764\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1765\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1766\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1767\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1768\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1769\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1770\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1771\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1772\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1773\" />",
