One of your tasks as GM is to recap events to clarify and reinforce the shared narrative.\n\n Shared narrative control also complicates planning ahead. The group might need to improvise an encounter, take a break while you (and maybe other players) prep to go in a new direction, or even revise their plans. It helps to limit yourself to creatures that you can quickly find stats for in a _Bestiary_ volume or in the NPC Gallery of this book to avoid spending hours of work on creatures you won’t use.\n\n Also, don’t lose sight of your own enjoyment!
