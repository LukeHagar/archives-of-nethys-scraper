This section also includes downtime events to make the story of crafting items more interesting and varied, and rules for deconstructing and repurposing items the party has for use in crafting new items.\n\n The [Nature Crafting](/Rules.aspx?ID=1956) section presents options for a world in which druids and creatures of the wild might be the primary intercessors and power sources for crafting items. This section presents the [Grow](/Actions.aspx?ID=1905) activity, an alternative to the [Craft](/Actions.aspx?ID=43) activity for items that can be grown from the natural world. These bestowed gifts represent magical items as creations awarded to the PCs in acknowledgment of their heroic services to powerful magic creatures. Gardens represent a type of renewable resource that can provide temporary consumables for the group and allow characters to create places in the setting wherein they can readily acquire or requisition items they want for their adventures.\n\n The [Story-Based Crafting](/Rules.aspx?ID=1957) section offers a system where every notable magic item the player characters acquire is part of an epic story and adventure. The players work with you, the GM, to determine what items they want to acquire and what kind of adventures they might have to assemble the necessary pieces. These variant rules work best in campaigns where player input and direction on the story are desirable, and where the core story of the campaign is primarily a “sandbox” or open world whose events are dictated by player choice.\n\n Story-based crafting and nature crafting can be used together in the same campaign with little issue, though it's still recommended that you try out each subsystem one at a time. A [garden](/Rules.aspx?ID=1932) for consumables can nicely compliment permanent items gained via [bestowed gifts](/Rules.aspx?ID=1929) and [crafting quests](/Rules.aspx?ID=1943). The crafting alternate rules, especially complex crafting, are meant to interact with the core crafting rules and may have unintended and undesirable consequences that can either confuse the crafting process or affect the game disproportionately when used in conjunction with either of the new variant systems.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">New Crafting Rules</title>\r\n\r\nSome of the new options presented in this section can be used to enhance or adjust the core crafting rules, while others can serve as partial or complete replacements.

 "text": " Secrets of Crafting Source Treasure Vault pg. 157 1.1 This chapter includes several new subsystems and options to enhance or replace the rules for crafting new items presented in the Pathfinder Core Rulebook . The Crafting Alternate Rules section presents complex crafting rules, which can make crafting more complicated but also more nuanced. These rules allow for more distinctions between the time required to craft a permanent item versus a consumable, and include adjustments for decreasing the time required to craft an item by increasing the difficulty of the crafting process. This section also includes downtime events to make the story of crafting items more interesting and varied, and rules for deconstructing and repurposing items the party has for use in crafting new items. The Nature Crafting section presents options for a world in which druids and creatures of the wild might be the primary intercessors and power sources for crafting items. This section presents the Grow activity, an alternative to the Craft activity for items that can be grown from the natural world.
