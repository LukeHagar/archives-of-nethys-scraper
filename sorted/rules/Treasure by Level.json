The Total Value column gives an approximate total value of all the treasure, in case you want to spend it like a budget. The next several columns provide suggestions for breaking down that total into permanent items, which the PCs keep and use for a long time; consumables, which are destroyed after being used once; and currency, which includes coins, gems, and other valuables primarily spent to acquire items or services. The final column gives the amount of currency to add for each PC beyond four in the group; use this only if you have more than four characters in the game. (Different Party Sizes on page 510 provides more guidance on this.)\n\n For instance, between the time your PCs reach 3rd level and the time they reach 4th level, you should give them the treasure listed in the table for 3rd level, worth approximately 500 gp: two 4th-level permanent items, two 3rd-level permanent items, two 4th-level consumables, two 3rd-level consumables, two 2nd-level consumables, and 120 gp worth of currency.\n\n When assigning 1st-level permanent items, your best options are armor, weapons, and other gear from Chapter 6 worth between 10 and 20 gp. The treasure listed in the row for 20th level represents a full level’s worth of adventures, even though there is no way to reach 21st level.\n\n Some creature entries in the _Pathfinder Bestiary_ list treasure that can be gained by defeating an individual creature; this counts toward the treasure for any given level. Published adventures include a suitable amount of treasure throughout the adventure, though you should still monitor the party’s capabilities as the PCs progress through the adventure to make sure they don’t end up behind.\n\n## Table 10-9: Party Treasure by Level\n<row gap=\"tiny\">\n<table> <tr><td>**Level**</td><td>**Total Value**</td><td>**Permanent Items (By Item Level)**</td><td>**Consumables (By Item Level)**</td><td>**Party Currency**</td><td>**Currency per Additional PC**</td></tr> <tr><td>1</td><td>175 gp</td><td>**2nd**: 2, **1st**: 2</td><td>**2nd**: 2, **1st**: 3</td><td>40 gp</td><td>10 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>2</td><td>300 gp</td><td>**3rd**: 2, **2nd**: 2</td><td>**3rd**: 2, **2nd**: 2, **1st**: 2</td><td>70 gp</td><td>18 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>3</td><td>500 gp</td><td>**4th**: 2, **3rd**: 2</td><td>**4th**: 2, **3rd**: 2, **2nd**: 2</td><td>120 gp</td><td>30 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>4</td><td>850 gp</td><td>**5th**: 2, **4th**: 2</td><td>**5th**: 2, **4th**: 2, **3rd**: 2</td><td>200 gp</td><td>50 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>5</td><td>1,350 gp</td><td>**6th**: 2, **5th**: 2</td><td>**6th**: 2, **5th**: 2, **4th**: 2</td><td>320 gp</td><td>80 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>6</td><td>2,000 gp</td><td>**7th**: 2, **6th**: 2</td><td>**7th**: 2, **6th**: 2, **5th**: 2</td><td>500 gp</td><td>125 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>7</td><td>2,900 gp</td><td>**8th**: 2, **7th**: 2</td><td>**8th**: 2, **7th**: 2, **6th**: 2</td><td>720 gp</td><td>180 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>8</td><td>4,000 gp</td><td>**9th**: 2, **8th**: 2</td><td>**9th**: 2, **8th**: 2, **7th**: 2</td><td>1,000 gp</td><td>250 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>9</td><td>5,700 gp</td><td>**10th**: 2, **9th**: 2</td><td>**10th**: 2, **9th**: 2, **8th**: 2</td><td>1,400 gp</td><td>350 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>10</td><td>8,000 gp</td><td>**11th**: 2, **10th**: 2</td><td>**11th**: 2, **10th**: 2, **9th**: 2</td><td>2,000 gp</td><td>500 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>11</td><td>11,500 gp</td><td>**12th**: 2, **11th**: 2</td><td>**12th**: 2, **11th**: 2, **10th**: 2</td><td>2,800 gp</td><td>700 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>12</td><td>16,500 gp</td><td>**13th**: 2, **12th**: 2</td><td>**13th**: 2, **12th**: 2, **11th**: 2</td><td>4,000 gp</td><td>1,000 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>13</td><td>25,000 gp</td><td>**14th**: 2, **13th**: 2</td><td>**14th**: 2, **13th**: 2, **12th**: 2</td><td>6,000 gp</td><td>1,500 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>14</td><td>36,500 gp</td><td>**15th**: 2, **14th**: 2</td><td>**15th**: 2, **14th**: 2, **13th**: 2</td><td>9,000 gp</td><td>2,250 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>15</td><td>54,500 gp</td><td>**16th**: 2, **15th**: 2</td><td>**16th**: 2, **15th**: 2, **14th**: 2</td><td>13,000 gp</td><td>3,250 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>16</td><td>82,500 gp</td><td>**17th**: 2, **16th**: 2</td><td>**17th**: 2, **16th**: 2, **15th**: 2</td><td>20,000 gp</td><td>5,000 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>17</td><td>128,000 gp</td><td>**18th**: 2, **17th**: 2</td><td>**18th**: 2, **17th**: 2, **16th**: 2</td><td>30,000 gp</td><td>7,500 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>18</td><td>208,000 gp</td><td>**19th**: 2, **18th**: 2</td><td>**19th**: 2, **18th**: 2, **17th**: 2</td><td>48,000 gp</td><td>12,000 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>19</td><td>355,000 gp</td><td>**20th**: 2, **19th**: 2</td><td>**20th**: 2, **19th**: 2, **18th**: 2</td><td>80,000 gp</td><td>20,000 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>20</td><td>490,000 gp</td><td>**20th**: 4</td><td>**20th**: 4, **19th**: 2</td><td>140,000 gp</td><td>35,000 gp</td></tr> </table></row>\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-582\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-583\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-584\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-585\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-586\" />",
