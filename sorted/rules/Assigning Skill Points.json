However, at every level beyond 1st, instead of gaining skill increases, the character gains a number of Skill Points, as indicated on Table 4–19: Skill Points by Level. The character can spend these Skill Points to increase their proficiency rank in various skills, as shown on Table 4–20: Cost to Increase Rank. A character must meet the minimum level indicated on the table to increase their rank, primarily to avoid having a player becoming unrealistically good at one skill early in their adventuring career while neglecting everything else. Characters can save up Skill Points between levels for a more expensive increase later on. \n\n## Table 4-19: Skill Points by Level\n<row gap=\"tiny\">\n<table><tr><td>Level</td><td>Skill Points Gained</td></tr> <tr><td>1</td><td>Initial proficiencies</td></tr> <tr><td>2–5</td><td>1</td></tr> <tr><td>6–13</td><td>2</td></tr> <tr><td>14–20</td><td>4</td></tr></table>\r\n</row>\n\n## Table 4-20: Cost to Increase Rank\n<row gap=\"tiny\">\n<table><tr><td>**Rank**</td><td>**Minimum Level**</td><td>**Skill Point Cost**</td></tr> <tr><td>Untrained to trained</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr> <tr><td>Trained to expert</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr> <tr><td>Expert to master</td><td>7</td><td>4</td></tr> <tr><td>Master to legendary</td><td>15</td><td>8</td></tr></table>\r\n</row>\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1375\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1376\" />",
