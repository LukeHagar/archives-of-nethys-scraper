These numbers are based on a 2-action activity (e.g., most damaging spells). Single actions should deal much less damage. An ability that has another significant effect, like applying a condition, should deal less damage; for this, look at the damage for 2 or more levels lower, and judge which value would best match based on the severity of the additional effect. These abilities typically allow a basic saving throw. The table includes values for unlimited‑use abilities (ones that can be used at-will) and limited-use ones (which can be used once or, like a Breath Weapon, once or twice but not on consecutive turns).\n\n You can use the dice given or generate your own expression based on the damage in parentheses, as detailed in the Strike Damage section on page 64. If a high-level effect has a small area compared to similar abilities, you have it deal more damage.\n\n## Table 2–12: Area Damage\n<row gap=\"tiny\">\n<table> <tr><td>**Level**</td><td>**Unlimited Use**</td><td>**Limited Use**</td></tr> <tr><td>–1</td><td>1d4 (2)</td><td>1d6 (4)</td></tr> <tr><td>0</td><td>1d6 (4)</td><td>1d10 (6)</td></tr> <tr><td>1</td><td>2d4 (5)</td><td>2d6 (7)</td></tr> <tr><td>2</td><td>2d6 (7)</td><td>3d6 (11)</td></tr> <tr><td>3</td><td>2d8 (9)</td><td>4d6 (14)</td></tr> <tr><td>4</td><td>3d6 (11)</td><td>5d6 (18)</td></tr> <tr><td>5</td><td>2d10 (12)</td><td>6d6 (21)</td></tr> <tr><td>6</td><td>4d6 (14)</td><td>7d6 (25)</td></tr> <tr><td>7</td><td>4d6 (15)</td><td>8d6 (28)</td></tr> <tr><td>8</td><td>5d6 (17)</td><td>9d6 (32)</td></tr> <tr><td>9</td><td>5d6 (18)</td><td>10d6 (35)</td></tr> <tr><td>10</td><td>6d6 (20)</td><td>11d6 (39)</td></tr> <tr><td>11</td><td>6d6 (21)</td><td>12d6 (42)</td></tr> <tr><td>12</td><td>5d8 (23)</td><td>13d6 (46)</td></tr> <tr><td>13</td><td>7d6 (24)</td><td>14d6 (49)</td></tr> <tr><td>14</td><td>4d12 (26)</td><td>15d6 (53)</td></tr> <tr><td>15</td><td>6d8 (27)</td><td>16d6 (56)</td></tr> <tr><td>16</td><td>8d6 (28)</td><td>17d6 (60)</td></tr> <tr><td>17</td><td>8d6 (29)</td><td>18d6 (63)</td></tr> <tr><td>18</td><td>9d6 (30)</td><td>19d6 (67)</td></tr> <tr><td>19</td><td>7d8 (32)</td><td>20d6 (70)</td></tr> <tr><td>20</td><td>6d10 (33)</td><td>21d6 (74)</td></tr> <tr><td>21</td><td>10d6 (35)</td><td>22d6 (77)</td></tr> <tr><td>22</td><td>8d8 (36)</td><td>23d6 (81)</td></tr> <tr><td>23</td><td>11d6 (38)</td><td>24d6 (84)</td></tr> <tr><td>24</td><td>11d6 (39)</td><td>25d6 (88)</td></tr> </table></row>\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>",
