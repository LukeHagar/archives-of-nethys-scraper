Any organization below level 1 has no followers; it’s just an ordinary group of PCs. Unlike many other subsystems in this chapter, leveling up an organization in the leadership subsystem does not involve accumulating points. Instead, the process of growing the organization itself is what causes it to level up! As a reward for quests, roleplaying scenes, or succeeding at other subsystems (particularly influence or reputation), the PCs can add an NPC follower to their organization. At first, only a few level 0 NPCs follow the PCs, but as the party builds up more followers, they can also gain followers of higher and higher level, as well as a small number of higher-level lieutenants to lead groups of followers. Once an organization has recruited enough followers, the organization itself levels up, which increases the maximum level of followers, the number of lieutenants, and the level range of those lieutenants. \n\n## Table 3–3: Organization Statistics by Level\n<row gap=\"tiny\">\n<table> <tr><td>**Level**</td><td>**Followers**</td><td>**Max Follower Level**</td><td>**Lieutenants**</td><td>**Lieutenant Levels**</td></tr> <tr><td>1</td><td>1–2</td><td>0</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr> <tr><td>2</td><td>3–4</td><td>0</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr> <tr><td>3</td><td>5–6</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr> <tr><td>4</td><td>7–9</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr> <tr><td>5</td><td>10–13</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr> <tr><td>6</td><td>14–18</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr> <tr><td>7</td><td>19–27</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr> <tr><td>8</td><td>28–36</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>2–3</td></tr> <tr><td>9</td><td>37–53</td><td>1</td><td>4–5</td><td>2–3</td></tr> <tr><td>10</td><td>54–75</td><td>2</td><td>6–7</td><td>3–4</td></tr> <tr><td>11</td><td>76–99</td><td>2</td><td>8–10</td><td>3–4</td></tr> <tr><td>12</td><td>100–150</td><td>2</td><td>11–15</td><td>3–5</td></tr> <tr><td>13</td><td>151–215</td><td>2</td><td>16–22</td><td>3–5</td></tr> <tr><td>14</td><td>216–300</td><td>3</td><td>23–30</td><td>4–6</td></tr> <tr><td>15</td><td>301–425</td><td>3</td><td>31–42</td><td>4–6</td></tr> <tr><td>16</td><td>426–600</td><td>3</td><td>43–60</td><td>4–7</td></tr> <tr><td>17</td><td>601–850</td><td>3</td><td>61–85</td><td>4–7</td></tr> <tr><td>18</td><td>851–1,200</td><td>4</td><td>86–120</td><td>5–8</td></tr> <tr><td>19</td><td>1,201–1,700</td><td>4</td><td>121–170</td><td>5–8</td></tr> <tr><td>20</td><td>1,701–2,400</td><td>4</td><td>171–240</td><td>5–9</td></tr> </table></row>\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>",
