Additionally, test your creature to see how it functions at the table. Pay close attention to the numbers—can it be hit, does it endure as intended, and are its Strikes fair—as well as the abilities, feel, and pace of the combat. Most importantly, do the creature's abilities reflect the megafauna you intended to create? If not, do some tweaking and give it another test.
