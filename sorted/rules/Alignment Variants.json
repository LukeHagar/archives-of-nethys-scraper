The alignment system can trouble some players because it doesn’t simulate the nuance and complexity of real‑world moral issues, which are often not so easily categorized. What is considered “good” may be heavily influenced by societal norms or religious beliefs. It’s not hard to find two kind, generous people who hold starkly differing interpretations of what good is in specific situations.
