Dexterity, Constitution, and Wisdom tend to be more important unless a character requires a particular ability score from among the other three for a specific purpose. If you'd prefer ability scores to all be of roughly equivalent value in character building, this variant creates six ability scores that are in much closer balance with each other. Make the following changes. \n<ul><li>**Strength** does everything that both Strength and Constitution do in the _Core Rulebook_, and Constitution is gone. A character uses their Strength for melee weapon and unarmed attack rolls, damage rolls, Athletics, Hit Points, Fortitude saves, and so on. </li><li>**Dexterity** splits into two ability scores. The first, still called Dexterity, represents manual dexterity and applies to ranged weapon and unarmed attack rolls, attack and damage rolls with finesse attacks (if better than Strength), and [Thievery](/Skills.aspx?ID=17) checks. Agility, which represents footwork, applies to Armor Class, Reflex saves, [Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) checks, and [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) checks. </li><li>**Charisma** applies to Will saves instead of Wisdom. </li><li>**Wisdom** is otherwise unchanged. </li><li>**Intelligence** is unchanged.</li></ul> You'll need a small number of gameplay tweaks. [_Anklets of alacrity_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=397) become an Agility apex item, both the [_belt of giant strength_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=398) and [_belt of regeneration_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=399) become Strength apex items, and so on. The rogue's [thief racket](/Rackets.aspx?ID=3) is obsolete, so you might allow rogues to choose a different racket but still gain [Thievery](/Skills.aspx?ID=17). For anything else that references an ability score, such as feats with a Dexterity prerequisite, decide with your group whether Dexterity or Agility makes more sense as the prerequisite. For instance, Agility would make sense for [Feather Step](/Feats.aspx?ID=783) since that feat involves footwork. Prewritten NPCs and monsters can just use their Dexterity modifier when their Agility modifier is necessary.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>",
