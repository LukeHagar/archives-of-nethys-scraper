In the world in which you, the reader, live, the history of firearms followed a meandering course around the globe, developing in a slow and uneven arc with many dead-ends and tributaries of varying success and longevity. On Golarion, a world of spells and myths, creatures and cataclysms, this developmental arc is even more diverse, with unexpected leaps forward and unique variations incorporating elements only possible in a world of magic and fantastical creatures.\n\n This chapter will showcase a variety of firearms. Some have historical inspirations, while others are more unusual black powder weapons, never seen on Earth due to the differences in the two worlds' technological advancements, historical eras, and societal shifts.

In Avistan, reckless scientists and innovative undead hunters in the nation of Ustalav have championed a technological renaissance, spurring the development of basic but effective muskets copied off Alkenstar originals and, in the process, creating a burgeoning market for silver bullets and bayonets. In the Shackles, Motaku Isle Ironworks continues to pump out shoddy, but deadly, replicas of firearms and cannons stolen from Alkenstar, as well as create new (usually unstable) black powder weaponry. Alkenstar itself boasts the premier black powder gunsmiths on the planet and is the undisputed center of modern innovation for firearm accessories. In Tian Xia, the nations of Goka, Ling Shen, Po Li, and Quain have long worked with black powder, using it to spur other technological advancements. The continent of Arcadia has seen decades of relatively uninterrupted peace and might contain more gunslingers than the rest of Golarion combined, though their firearms are a more diverse array of magical star guns, technological air guns, and ceremonial beast guns, with no black powder whatsoever. Characters from these regions have access to the gunslinger class and firearms. Other than Arcadia, they have access to black powder siege weapons if the GM has opened up siege weapons as an option for the campaign.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1649\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1651\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1656\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1658\" />",
