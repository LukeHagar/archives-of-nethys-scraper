They can cast the [_daze_](/Spells.aspx?ID=61) cantrip at will and get a second spell that can be cast once during the duel. They choose from the following when they roll initiative: [_fear_](/Spells.aspx?ID=110), [_phantom pain_](/Spells.aspx?ID=220), or a common summoning spell (typically [_summon animal_](/Spells.aspx?ID=316), [_summon construct_](/Spells.aspx?ID=318), [_summon fey_](/Spells.aspx?ID=322), or [_summon lesser servitor_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1010) for a 1st-level spell). If the creature can't cast spells, they gain these as innate occult spells until the end of the psychic duel. If they can already cast spells, they add these to their other spells and temporarily gain any spell slots necessary to cast them (even if they can't cast spells of that level yet) that can be used only for the additional spell. Natural psychic spells use the higher of the caster's spell DC or class DC for their spell DC, and that number – 10 for spell attack rolls.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>",
