You need to locate a site for the camp, set it up, prepare and eat food, and address any other basic needs, including allowing some time for relaxation before sleep!\n\n The dangers facing campers in the Stolen Lands vary greatly depending on where the camp is set. To quantify these dangers, each zone of the Stolen Lands (as defined in Chapter 2 of the _Kingmaker Adventure Path_) has its own values. The table below lists all 20 zones of the Stolen Lands, organized by level from 0 to 19. The Zone DC is the base DC required for success at any skill check involved with securing the campsite or performing most campsite activities; these DCs closely follow the [expected DCs by level](/Rules.aspx?ID=554) but some of them have been adjusted upward or downward to account for that zone's additional dangers (or lack thereof). The Encounter DC indicates the flat check DC of a random encounter occurring during the camping session. And the number listed under the Encounter Chart column lists the _Kingmaker Adventure Path_ page number for that zone's random encounter table.\n\n## Camping Zones\n<row gap=\"tiny\">\n<table><tr><td>**Zone**</td><td>**Name**</td><td>**Zone DC**</td><td>**Encounter DC**</td><td>**Page**</td></tr> <tr><td>0</td><td>Brevoy</td><td>14</td><td>12</td><td>50</td></tr> <tr><td>1</td><td>Rostland Hinterlands</td><td>15</td><td>12</td><td>51</td></tr> <tr><td>2</td><td>Greenbelt</td><td>16</td><td>14</td><td>58</td></tr> <tr><td>3</td><td>Tuskwater</td><td>18</td><td>12</td><td>69</td></tr> <tr><td>4</td><td>Kamelands</td><td>19</td><td>12</td><td>78</td></tr> <tr><td>5</td><td>Narlmarches</td><td>20</td><td>14</td><td>82</td></tr> <tr><td>6</td><td>Sellen Hills</td><td>20</td><td>12</td><td>84</td></tr> <tr><td>7</td><td>Dunsward</td><td>18</td><td>12</td><td>87</td></tr> <tr><td>8</td><td>Nomen Heights</td><td>24</td><td>12</td><td>90</td></tr> <tr><td>9</td><td>Tors of Levenies</td><td>28</td><td>16</td><td>91</td></tr> <tr><td>10</td><td>Hooktongue</td><td>32</td><td>14</td><td>94</td></tr> <tr><td>11</td><td>Drelev</td><td>28</td><td>12</td><td>103</td></tr> <tr><td>12</td><td>Tiger Lords</td><td>28</td><td>12</td><td>105</td></tr> <tr><td>13</td><td>Rushlight</td><td>26</td><td>12</td><td>108</td></tr> <tr><td>14</td><td>Glenebon Lowlands</td><td>30</td><td>12</td><td>108</td></tr> <tr><td>15</td><td>Pitax</td><td>29</td><td>12</td><td>109</td></tr> <tr><td>16</td><td>Glenebon Uplands</td><td>35</td><td>12</td><td>110</td></tr> <tr><td>17</td><td>Numeria</td><td>36</td><td>12</td><td>112</td></tr> <tr><td>18</td><td>Thousand Voices</td><td>43</td><td>14</td><td>115</td></tr> <tr><td>19</td><td>Branthlend Mountains</td><td>41</td><td>16</td><td>117</td></tr> </table></row>\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1887\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1888\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1889\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1890\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1891\" />",
