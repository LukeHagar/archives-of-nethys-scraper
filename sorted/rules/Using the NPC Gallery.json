Their levels span from –1 to 8, the range you most often need for stock characters. Since high-level opponents, major villains, ruling monarchs, and the like tend to be unique individuals, you'll likely create those NPCs specifically for the role they serve, using the rules for [Building Creatures](/Rules.aspx?ID=995). But you can never have too many lower-level NPCs on hand when the PCs unexpectedly take an unusually keen interest in an NPC or pick a fight at a roadside tavern.\n\n The level listed on an NPC's stat block is their level assuming they're used in combat; they should be able to hold their own as well as any other creature of that level. But many of these NPCs are primarily noncombatants who are much more skilled in their occupation than they ever would be in combat. To that end, those specialist NPCs' entries also mention a higher level that you would use when the PCs have to compete against them in their area of expertise.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Chapter Map</title>\r\n\r\nThe chapter divides NPCs into 18 sections to make it easier for you to find the types of characters you need for your game. \n<ul><li>[Courtiers](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=181)</li><li>[Criminals](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=182)</li><li>[Devotees](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=183)</li><li>[Downtrodden](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=184)</li><li>[Explorers](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=185)</li><li>[Foresters](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=186)</li><li>[Healers](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=187)</li><li>[Laborers](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=188)</li><li>[Magistrates](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=189)</li><li>[Mercenaries](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=190)</li><li>[Mystics](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=191)</li><li>[Officers](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=192)</li><li>[Performers](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=193)</li><li>[Publicans](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=194)</li><li>[Scholars](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=195)</li><li>[Seafarers](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=196)</li><li>[Tradespeople](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=197)</li><li>[Villains](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=198)</li></ul>\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1397\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1398\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1399\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1400\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1401\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1407\" />",
