The sizes and the spaces they each take up on a grid are listed in Table 9–1: Size and Reach (page 474). Table 9–1 also lists the typical reach for creatures of each size, for both tall creatures (most bipeds) and long creatures (most quadrupeds). See page 455 for more about reach.\n\n The Space entry lists how many feet on a side a creature’s space is, so a Large creature fills a 10-foot-by-10-foot space (4 squares on the grid). Sometimes part of a creature extends beyond its space, such as if a giant octopus is grabbing you with its tentacles. In that case, the GM will usually allow attacking the extended portion, even if you can’t reach the main creature. A Small or larger creature or object takes up at least 1 square on a grid, and creatures of these sizes can’t usually share spaces except in situations like a character riding a mount. Rules for moving through other creatures’ spaces appear below.\n\n## Table 9-1: Size and Reach\n<row gap=\"tiny\">\n<table> <tr><td>**Size**</td><td>**Space**</td><td>**Reach (Tall)**</td><td>**Reach (Long)**</td></tr> <tr><td>Tiny</td><td>Less than 5 feet</td><td>0 feet</td><td>0 feet</td></tr> <tr><td>Small</td><td>5 feet</td><td>5 feet</td><td>5 feet</td></tr> <tr><td>Medium</td><td>5 feet</td><td>5 feet</td><td>5 feet</td></tr> <tr><td>Large</td><td>10 feet</td><td>10 feet</td><td>5 feet</td></tr> <tr><td>Huge</td><td>15 feet</td><td>15 feet</td><td>10 feet</td></tr> <tr><td>Gargantuan</td><td>20 feet or more</td><td>20 feet</td><td>15 feet</td></tr> </table></row>\n\n Multiple Tiny creatures can occupy the same square. At least four can fit in a single square, though the GM might determine that even more can fit. Tiny creatures can occupy a space occupied by a larger creature as well, and if their reach is 0 feet, they must do so in order to attack.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>",
