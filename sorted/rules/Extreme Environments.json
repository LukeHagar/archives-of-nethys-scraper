 "text": " Extreme Environments Source Gamemastery Guide pg. 123 Some adventures lead to fantastic reaches of the world or the multiverse that are seldom tread by mortals. Aerial: A world might include windy realms of floating islands and castles in the clouds. Glacier: Massive sheets of dense ice, constantly moving under their own immense weight, glaciers are frozen wastelands riddled with columns of jagged ice and snow‑covered crevasses. Volcanic: Hellish landscapes of molten lava, burning ash, and scorching temperatures pose immediate danger. Undersea: A subset of aquatic environments, undersea environments are those areas submerged beneath the waves. Underground: Some worlds have deep natural caverns, while others have extensive winding tunnels and expansive realms below the surface. ",
