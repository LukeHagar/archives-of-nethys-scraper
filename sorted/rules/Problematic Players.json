You shouldn’t immediately jump on every instance of problematic play—everyone has a bad night on occasion.

Attempt to handle the problem privately away from the game, or call a break to have a private conversation if the situation is really urgent. As with all emotionally charged conversations, email, text messages and the like can lose the subtlety of speech—it’s better to meet the player face to face, if possible.
