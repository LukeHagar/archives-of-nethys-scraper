Exploration lacks the immediate danger of encounter mode, but it offers its own challenges.\n\n Much of exploration mode involves movement and roleplaying. You might be traveling from one town to another, chatting with a couple of merchants an outpost along the way, or maybe having a terse conversation with the watchful city guards at your destination. Instead of measuring your rate of movement in 5-foot squares every round, you measure it in feet or miles per minute, hour, or day, using your travel speed. Rather than deciding on each action every turn, you’ll engage in an exploration activity, and you’ll typically spend some time every day resting and making your daily preparations.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-470\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-471\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-472\" />",
