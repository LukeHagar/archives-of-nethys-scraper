For instance, if you’re using a normal longsword, you’ll roll 1d8. If you’re casting a 3rd-level [_fireball_](/Spells.aspx?ID=119) spell, you’ll roll 6d6. Sometimes, especially in the case of weapons, you’ll apply modifiers, bonuses, and penalties to the damage. \n\n When you use melee weapons, unarmed attacks, and thrown ranged weapons, the most common modifier you’ll add to damage is your Strength ability modifier. Weapons with the propulsive trait sometimes add half your Strength modifier. You typically do not add an ability modifier to spell damage, damage from most ranged weapons, or damage from alchemical bombs and similar items.\n\n As with checks, you might add circumstance, status, or item bonuses to your damage rolls, but if you have multiple bonuses of the same type, you add only the highest bonus of that type. Again like checks, you may also apply circumstance, status, item, and untyped penalties to the damage roll, and again you apply only the greatest penalty of a specific type but apply all untyped penalties together. \n\n Use the formulas below. \n\n<center>**Melee damage roll = damage die of weapon or unarmed attack + Strength modifier + bonuses + penalties**</center> \n\n<center>**Ranged damage roll = damage die of weapon + Strength modifier for thrown weapons + bonuses + penalties**</center> \n\n<center>**Spell (and similar effects) damage roll = damage die of the effect + bonuses + penalties**</center> If the combined penalties on an attack would reduce the damage to 0 or below, you still deal 1 damage. Once your damage die is rolled, and you’ve applied any modifiers, bonuses, and penalties, move on to Step 2. Though sometimes there are special considerations, described below.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-337\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-338\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-339\" />",
