Types of Terrain The following are examples of the types of terrain you can use when creating your hexploration map. Each section provides the difficulty of traversing that terrain (either open, difficult, or greater difficult terrain) and the potential resources and secrets found there. ### Aquatic Terrain typically requires a boat or a swim speed; depends on the strengths of currents and the weather Resources seafood, coral, pearls, shipwrecks Secrets remote islands filled with monsters, isolated communities, pirates, flooded or underwater cities of aquatic creatures ### Arctic Terrain typically difficult or greater difficult terrain Resources scarce food (broken ice floes that allow for fishing, breeding grounds for seals or whales) Secret thawed passes that allow ship travel, hidden caverns, isolated communities of arctic dwellers ### Desert Terrain typically difficult or greater difficult terrain Resources water sources (underground springs, oases, and streams), mineral wealth Secrets forgotten civilizations beneath the dunes ### Forest Terrain typically difficult terrain, or greater difficult terrain for a dense jungle Resources diverse flora and fauna, natural remedies, plentiful game Secrets bandit encampment, druid’s henge, fey-touched glade or mushroom circle ### Mountain Terrain typically greater difficult terrain, or difficult terrain for hills Resources minerals (including gold, silver, and gemstones) Secrets hidden pass, watchtower or waypoint constructed by a nearby empire, dragon’s lair, bandit hideout ### Plain Terrain open terrain Resources useful plants (flax or cotton) Secrets artifacts abandoned after a historic battle, valuables buried by outlaws for later retrieval ### Swamp Terrain typically greater difficult terrain Resources materials useful for medicine or poison Secrets river raider camps, remains and gear of unlucky travelers, sites of mystic significance ",
