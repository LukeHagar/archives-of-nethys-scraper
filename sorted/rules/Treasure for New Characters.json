A single item on this table is always a baseline item.

If the PC is joining a party that has already made progress toward the next level, consider giving the new character an additional item of their current level. If your party has kept the treasure of dead or retired PCs and passed it on to new characters, you might need to give the new character less than the values on the table or reduce some of the treasure rewards of the next few adventures.\n\n## Table 10-10: Character Wealth\n<row gap=\"tiny\">\n<table> <tr><td>**Level**</td><td>**Permanent Items**</td><td>**Currency**</td><td>**Lump Sum**</td></tr> <tr><td>1</td><td>\\-</td><td>15 gp</td><td>15 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>2</td><td>**1st**: 1</td><td>20 gp</td><td>30 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>3</td><td>**2nd**: 1, **1st**: 2</td><td>25 gp</td><td>75 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>4</td><td>**3rd**: 1, **2nd**: 2, **1st**: 1</td><td>30 gp</td><td>140 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>5</td><td>**4th**: 1, **3rd**: 2, **2nd**: 1, **1st**: 2</td><td>50 gp</td><td>270 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>6</td><td>**5th**: 1, **4th**: 2, **3rd**: 1, **2nd**: 2</td><td>80 gp</td><td>450 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>7</td><td>**6th**: 1, **5th**: 2, **4th**: 1, **3rd**: 2</td><td>125 gp</td><td>720 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>8</td><td>**7th**: 1, **6th**: 2, **5th**: 1, **4th**: 2</td><td>180 gp</td><td>1,100 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>9</td><td>**8th**: 1, **7th**: 2, **6th**: 1, **5th**: 2</td><td>250 gp</td><td>1,600 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>10</td><td>**9th**: 1, **8th**: 2, **7th**: 1, **6th**: 2</td><td>350 gp</td><td>2,300 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>11</td><td>**10th**: 1, **9th**: 2, **8th**: 1, **7th**: 2</td><td>500 gp</td><td>3,200 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>12</td><td>**11th**: 1, **10th**: 2, **9th**: 1, **8th**: 2</td><td>700 gp</td><td>4,500 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>13</td><td>**12th**: 1, **11th**: 2, **10th**: 1, **9th**: 2</td><td>1,000 gp</td><td>6,400 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>14</td><td>**13th**: 1, **12th**: 2, **11th**: 1, **10th**: 2</td><td>1,500 gp</td><td>9,300 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>15</td><td>**14th**: 1, **13th**: 2, **12th**: 1, **11th**: 2</td><td>2,250 gp</td><td>13,500 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>16</td><td>**15th**: 1, **14th**: 2, **13th**: 1, **12th**: 2</td><td>3,250 gp</td><td>20,000 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>17</td><td>**16th**: 1, **15th**: 2, **14th**: 1, **13th**: 2</td><td>5,000 gp</td><td>30,000 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>18</td><td>**17th**: 1, **16th**: 2, **15th**: 1, **14th**: 2</td><td>7,500 gp</td><td>45,000 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>19</td><td>**18th**: 1, **17th**: 2, **16th**: 1, **15th**: 2</td><td>12,000 gp</td><td>69,000 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>20</td><td>**19th**: 1, **18th**: 2, **17th**: 1, **16th**: 2</td><td>20,000 gp</td><td>112,000 gp</td></tr> </table></row>\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-588\" />",
