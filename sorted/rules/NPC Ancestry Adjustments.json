For other ancestries, you can create similar templates following the same format. In addition to these base changes, you can add the effects of a specific heritage: you might apply the [snow goblin](/Heritages.aspx?ID=19) heritage if your NPC is a Frostfur goblin and you want them to have cold resistance. You can also give them an ancestry feat, or even adjust their ability scores and skills to reflect the new ancestry's strengths and weaknesses. For a [half-elf](/Heritages.aspx?ID=26), [half-orc](/Heritages.aspx?ID=27), or any other heritage essential to the character, you should always apply the heritage effect.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1402\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1403\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1404\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1405\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1406\" />",
