It begins much the same: search for an appropriate stat block to use as a jumping-off point. Depending upon your megafauna concept, this may be a creature with the appropriate level, size, strength, Strikes, or tactics.\n\n Once you have your base creature, you'll begin to make changes, likely to the level and associated statistics of the creature, or by removing abilities and creating entirely new ones to better suit your megafauna. Advice for creating unique abilities is under [Design Abilities](/Rules.aspx?ID=1024), while the rules for selecting your creature's statistics begin with Abilitiy Modifiers under the [Building Creatures](/Rules.aspx?ID=995) rules.\n\n Alternatively, you can tweak a base creature with the [elite or weak adjustments](/Rules.aspx?ID=788) to increase or decrease the level and difficulty of a creature to better suit your concept. This is especially useful when creating a giant version of an animal, which can easily be representing by taking the base creature and adding the elite adjustment.\n\n Sometimes, you can take two stat blocks similar to that of your intended creature and combine them, using the statistical chassis of a creature of the appropriate level range, cutting the base creature's abilities, and adding on the abilities of a creature with appropriate Strikes, abilities, or tactics. For example, you might decide that your new desert-dwelling megafauna has the size and statistics of a [brontosaurus](/Monsters.aspx?ID=122) but can burrow and leap like a [bulette](/Monsters.aspx?ID=61). The resulting hybrid creature will be a unique twist on familiar creatures, created with minimal effort and difficulty.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>",
