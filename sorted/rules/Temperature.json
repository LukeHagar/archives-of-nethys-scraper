Summer days can be hot, but only very rarely fall into Mild Heat as detailed on [Table 10–13](/Rules.aspx?ID=642). For most of these seasons, temperatures remain in the Normal category and don't particularly impact game play. Winter days, on the other hand, can get cold, and snowfall isn't unheard of (although full-on blizzards are rare). As the PCs make their daily preparations, check to see if the day falls into the category of Mild Cold by attempting a DC 18 flat check (during the months of Kuthona or Calistril) or a DC 16 flat check (during the month of Abadius). On a success, the day ahead is particularly chilly, resulting in characters growing [fatigued](/Conditions.aspx?ID=15) after only 4 hours of daily activity rather than the normal 8 hours, and if there's light precipitation (see [Precipitation](/Rules.aspx?ID=1900) above), it includes snow.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>",
