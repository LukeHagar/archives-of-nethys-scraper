If you hope to bring a creature from real life prehistory into your gaming world, most of the work is done for you. A quick bit of research can often get you everything you need to know to bring your creature to life. Likewise, if you hope to make a giant version of any mundane animal, crafting a concept is simple. Creating megafauna from scratch, though, is considerably more difficult.\n\n Whatever your intent, the creature you're creating needs a concept. Consider the unique and interesting features of your creature. Perhaps it has the horns and crest of the aforementioned kosmoceratops, the spines of an amargasaurus, or the odor of a megafauna scavenger that consumes the dead. Decide what you'd like to emphasize.\n\n Then consider the role this creature serves. Is it a solitary hunter, pack hunter, or herd animal? Does it attack in the open or from hiding? Is it easily scared or stubborn? Even if you're basing your concept on a real-world extinct animal, fossil records are sparse about habits and behavior, so many of these decisions are yours to make.\n\n Consider the forms of attack your creature might have. How does it defend itself? Does it have claws, jaws, tentacles, tusks, or horns? Does it charge headfirst into battle or is it skittish? Does it display complex tactics or use the terrain to its advantage? \n\nOnce your concept is solidified, it's time to select the method you'll use to create your megafauna.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>",
