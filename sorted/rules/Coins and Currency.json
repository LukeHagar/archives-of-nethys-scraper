The most common currency is coins. For most commoners and beginning adventurers, the standard unit is the **silver piece (sp)**. Each silver piece is a standard weight of silver and is typically accepted by any merchant or kingdom no matter where it was minted. There are three other common types of coins, each likewise standardized in weight and value. The first is the **copper piece (cp)**. Each copper piece is worth one‑tenth of a silver piece. The **gold piece (gp)** is often used for purchasing magic items and other expensive items, as 1 gold piece is worth 10 silver pieces or 100 copper pieces. The **platinum piece (pp)** is used by nobles to demonstrate their wealth, for the purchase of very expensive items, or simply as a way to easily transport large sums of currency. A platinum piece is worth 10 gold pieces, 100 silver pieces, or 1,000 copper pieces. See Table 6–1: Coin Values for the exchange rates of common types of coins.\n\n## Table 6-1: Coin Values\n<row gap=\"tiny\">\n<table> <tr><td>**Coins**</td><td>**CP**</td><td>**SP**</td><td>**GP**</td><td>**PP**</td></tr> <tr><td>Copper piece (cp)</td><td>1</td><td>1/10</td><td>1/100</td><td>1/1,000</td></tr> <tr><td>Silver piece (sp)</td><td>10</td><td>1</td><td>1/10</td><td>1/100</td></tr> <tr><td>Gold Piece (gp</td><td>100</td><td>10</td><td>1</td><td>1/10</td></tr> <tr><td>Platinum piece (pp)</td><td>1,000</td><td>100</td><td>10</td><td>1</td></tr> </table></row>\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-183\" />",
