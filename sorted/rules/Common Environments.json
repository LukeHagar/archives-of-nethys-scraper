 "text": " Common Environments Source Gamemastery Guide pg. 123 The following environments are common enough that they might appear in nearly any adventure or world. Aquatic: Oceans, seas, lakes, and other large waterways are aquatic environments. Arctic: Arctic environments usually appear near the northern and southern extremes of a world, though extreme elevation, unusually shaped worlds, and supernatural forces could result in arctic terrain elsewhere. Desert: Deserts can appear anywhere on a world where precipitation is scant, even along some oceans. Any large landmasses that entirely lack bodies of water are likely to be deserts. Forest: The composition of a forest depends on the climate and the elevation, with thick jungles more common near an equator, hardwood forests in more temperate zones, and evergreens at higher latitudes and elevations.
