Megafauna animal companions are mostly similar to other animal companions of the same category, though they look different, and they have one difference in their upgrade path. If you take a feat that would normally allow you to choose to have your companion become a savage or nimble animal companion, a megafauna companion instead can choose to become a savage or indomitable companion. An indomitable companion increases its Constitution modifier by 2 and its Strength, Dexterity, and Wisdom modifiers by 1. It deals 3 additional damage with its unarmed attacks. Increase its proficiency rank in [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) to expert and its proficiency rank in barding to expert. It also learns the advanced maneuver for its type. If your companion is Medium or smaller, it grows in size by one category. Its attacks count as magical for the purpose of ignoring resistances.\n\nAny animal companion can be a megafauna animal companion. The GM has ultimate say on which animal companions can be megafauna animal companions, though most animal companions based on animals and beasts can be megafauna.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>",
