Though some companions provide foreshadowing to the PCs beforehand, each quest formally begins with a specific event timed to coincide with particular developments in the _Kingmaker Adventure Path_ and also to a specific character level for the companion. (In order to avoid the party becoming distracted with multiple personal quests at the same time, each quest triggers at a different character level.)\n\n Whether the PCs decide to accompany the companion on their quest is left to the players to decide. However, this book assumes that the PCs join the companion, who takes a full role in the PCs' party through the events and encounters of the short adventure. These companion quests are therefore designed for a party of 5 characters rather than the standard 4, so encounters in these quests are slightly more dangerous than comparable encounters in the _Kingmaker Adventure Path_.\n\n If the PCs choose not to accompany a companion on their personal quest, it's up to you to determine the ramifications. A companion might to try to tackle their quest on their own (in which case, that companion's disappearance might serve as an additional hook to lure the PCs into that quest), they might choose to let the quest slide and not pursue it, or they might even abandon the PCs to seek help elsewhere—such as from potential rival settlements like Drelev or Pitax. In such a case, a former companion could well show up as an antagonist working against the PCs later in the campaign!\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>",
