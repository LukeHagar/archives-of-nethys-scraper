Indeed, one of the primary plot points of Stolen Fate has the PCs tracking down the scattered cards from a mysterious and very powerful harrow deck. As the group discovers more cards, you can keep track of which ones they've recovered by keeping a stack of actual harrow cards to represent their discoveries.\n\n Since each of these harrow cards grants additional powers if player characters invest them, having physical cards can help to remind players of their options and give Stolen Fate a truly unique feel. \n\nIf your table thinks it might be fun, though, you can include the harrow in another way—as an element to give the PCs even more agency over their fates alongside the use of Hero Points. Keep in mind that the method of manipulating fate detailed below works best when you and the players are comfortable with improvisation and playing a bit fast and loose with the rules, all in order to present a more exciting story that feels like the PCs are indeed manipulating destiny rather than being stuck on a single fated path that they have no agency over. These optional rules aren't for everyone, so before you incorporate them into your table, make sure every player is comfortable with their inclusion in the game.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1990\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1991\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1992\" />",
