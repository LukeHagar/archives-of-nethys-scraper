Depending on the nature of the crafting quests, this might not require a skill check. For a longer crafting quest that included at least three encounters spread across different locations, the simple act of bringing the components together can be enough for their magic to do the rest of the work, uniting the components into a single, completed item the PC can immediately put to use. For a shorter crafting quest taking place in a single location, you can instead require a skill check (likely a [Crafting](/Skills.aspx?ID=4) check, but possibly using a different skill depending on the item and circumstances).\n\n When requiring a skill check to assemble a story-crafted item, you should make the check itself something appropriately exciting and epic, a fitting capstone for the completed crafting quest. For example, if the player's [dwarf](/Ancestries.aspx?ID=1) [fighter](/Classes.aspx?ID=7) completed a crafting quest that required them to assemble the materials for the haft, head, and grip of a magic hammer, their check could take place at an ancient dwarven forge blessed by [Torag](/Deities.aspx?ID=18), God of the Forge. The DC of this check should be based on the item's level, rarity, and other circumstances. If successful, the item works as intended. If the check fails, it may have a [quirk](/Rules.aspx?ID=1083) of some sort. If the check is a critical failure, it might be destroyed or even result in a [cursed item](/Rules.aspx?ID=1094)!\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>",
