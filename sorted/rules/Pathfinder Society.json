At the start of a session when you’re running a scenario, you’ll collect your players’ information. At the end of the adventure, you’ll record the rewards their characters earn for completing the scenario, all of which are detailed in the adventure. Once you report the session’s results online, the rewards become a persistent part of these characters, even if they play in other games with other groups. These scenarios include important choices, and you can report what your group chose—decisions that will guide the future of the campaign!\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>",
