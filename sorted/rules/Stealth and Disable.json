You’ll need to decide the proficiency rank necessary to find the hazard as well as disable it with each method. Remember, a hazard without a listed rank next to its Stealth DC is obvious enough that creatures can find it without Searching, and magical hazards without a listed rank are not normally protected against [_detect magic_](/Spells.aspx?ID=66). Most hazards built by intelligent creatures are concealed have at least a trained rank. Table 2–14 indicates the high and moderate proficiency requirements by level; you can use lower proficiency ranks than the ones listed, and if you use the high rank, consider a secondary, perhaps less-efficient method to disable the hazard using a lower rank. For instance, the bloodthirsty urge haunt in the _Core Rulebook_ can be disabled with master Religion, or by a higher DC with expert Diplomacy.\n\n If you need a Stealth modifier for a complex hazard, just subtract 10 from the listed DC. \n\n## Table 2–14: Minimum Proficiency\n<row gap=\"tiny\">\n<table> <tr><td>**Levels**</td><td>**High**</td><td>**Moderate**</td></tr> <tr><td>0 or lower</td><td>Untrained</td><td>Untrained</td></tr> <tr><td>1–4</td><td>Trained (expert for Perception)</td><td>Trained</td></tr> <tr><td>5–8</td><td>Expert</td><td>Trained</td></tr> <tr><td>9–18</td><td>Master</td><td>Expert</td></tr> <tr><td>19 or higher</td><td>Legendary</td><td>Master</td></tr> </table></row>\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>",
