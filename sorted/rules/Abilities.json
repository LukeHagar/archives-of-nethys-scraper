As you create these abilities, take into account where your megafauna lives—is this a harsh environment? If so, how has this creature adapted to survive? Consider how it interacts with its environment—does it blend in, trample it down, alter it, or adapt to suit it? Consider what your megafauna eats—does it actively hunt, lay in wait, or forage? Finally, consider how your megafauna defends itself. Embracing your megafauna's unique features can make for interesting creatures, exciting encounters, and variety at the gaming table.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>",
