Early diving equipment such as the [suit](/Equipment.aspx?ID=1261) and [bathysphere](/Vehicles.aspx?ID=38) presented here were dangerous to use, and losing air pressure to a diving suit could result in the wearer becoming lethally compressed into their helmet. However, for simplicity, Pathfinder's core rules for underwater adventuring don't include any rules for damage from pressure.
