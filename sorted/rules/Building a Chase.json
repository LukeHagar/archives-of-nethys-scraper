Having the NPCs clear one obstacle per round is a good rule of thumb, but it could vary depending on the situation, and should especially be slower against obstacles that require more than 1 Chase Point per character to overcome.\n\n Select or build obstacles highlighting a variety of different skills and other options so everyone in the party has a moment to shine. When choosing what skills can bypass a given obstacle, ensure a variety of approaches can work. If you’ve already decided that an obstacle uses Stealth, selecting Thievery as the other option doesn’t really offer opportunities for different types of characters, since those who are good at Thievery are very likely the same ones who are good at Stealth. On the other hand, offering Athletics as an alternative gives a champion who’s terrible at Stealth a way to help. The group can help cover for a character who is less capable at a particular obstacle, but it’s more fun for players to present substantially different options for each obstacle.\n\n Use the following guidelines to determine how many obstacles you need for your chase. These numbers assume that the pursued party can reach a certain location to end the chase (as described in Ending Chases). If there’s no such escape, you might need more obstacles.\n\n **Short:** 6 obstacles, about 10–20 minutes of game time\n\n **Medium:** 8 obstacles, about 15–25 minutes of game time\n\n **Long:** 10 obstacles, about 20–30 minutes of game time\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1213\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1214\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1215\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1216\" />",
