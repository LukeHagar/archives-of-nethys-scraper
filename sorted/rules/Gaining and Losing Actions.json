The [slowed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=35) condition, for example, causes you to lose actions, while the [quickened](/Conditions.aspx?ID=32) condition causes you to gain them. Conditions are detailed [here](/conditions). Whenever you lose a number of actions—whether from these conditions or in any other way—you choose which to lose if there's any difference between them. For instance, the [_haste_](/Spells.aspx?ID=147) spell makes you quickened, but it limits what you can use your extra action to do. If you lost an action while _haste_ was active, you might want to lose the action from _haste_ first, since it's more limited than your normal actions.\n\n Some effects are even more restrictive. Certain abilities, instead of or in addition to changing the number of actions you can use, say specifically that you can't use reactions. The most restrictive form of reducing actions is when an effect states that you can't act: this means you can't use any actions, or even speak. When you can't act, you still regain your actions unless a condition (like [stunned](/Conditions.aspx?ID=36)) prevents it.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>",
