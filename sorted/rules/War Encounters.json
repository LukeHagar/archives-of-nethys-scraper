 "text": " War Encounters Source Kingmaker Adventure Path pg. 576 War encounters aren't meant to serve as a precise and detailed simulation of the complexities of a mass combat event, but rather as a quick and engaging way to play out these clashes without detracting too much from the focus of a Kingmaker Campaign: the stories and adventures of the PCs themselves. A war encounter plays out during Downtime, as the result of an Offensive Gambit or hexploration. Offensive Gambit : You can initiate an Offensive Gambit activity against the enemy during the Army Activities step of the Kingdom turn. In this case, the war encounter takes place immediately after the Kingdom turn resolves. Hexploration : During hexploration, if the PCs are traveling with at least one army, they can encounter enemy armies. If either the PCs or the enemy initiate an attack, it immediately starts a war encounter. Traveling with an Army Normally, armies move through the Stolen Lands during Kingdom turns via the Deploy Army activity, but if the PCs wish to travel with armies during hexploration—a particularly wise choice during the War of the River Kings—they can do so. In this case, when the PCs come across a non-army encounter, assume the PCs' forces hang back while the PCs play out the encounter in encounter mode as usual. When the PCs encounter an army, they can engage it with their own army in a war encounter. If the PCs leave an army during hexploration, that army remains in its hex until the PCs return to guide it in hexploration mode again or until they move it with the Deploy Army activity during a Kingdom turn.
