This can be fun, but can also split up the group.

The danger therein is that a player can easily become frustrated if their character is stuck at an obstacle where it’s extremely difficult to succeed at either choice, and no allies can help them. In these chases, it’s best to allow even a single success be enough for a character to progress to the next obstacle, and have a critical success give the character a +2 circumstance bonus on their first check against the next obstacle.\r\n</aside>",
