That said, being a GM and running a game can present unique challenges. Sometimes problems present themselves at the table, and it’s up to the GM to resolve them.\n\n When dealing with problems at the table, keep in mind the primary reason to play Pathfinder is to have fun. And that’s true for everyone—player or GM. Don’t “solve” a problem by reducing everyone’s enjoyment of the game or their ability to forge a path for their characters. Of course, sometimes your solution might not make everyone deliriously happy. Play style is a highly personal, individual thing, rarely does a group agree on all things all the time. Solving problems can be as collaborative as the rest of the game. Only a foolish GM ignores the players’ opinions— but that said, the final decision in resolving a problem rests with you.\n\n Issues at the table arise occasionally. Broadly, such problems can be separated into four main categories: distractions, total party kills, problematic players, and power imbalances. The first of these is covered in detail on [page 491 of the _Core Rulebook_](/Rules.aspx?ID=506), and guidance for the others appears here.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-895\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-896\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-899\" />",
