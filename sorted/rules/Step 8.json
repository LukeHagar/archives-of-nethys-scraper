For weapons, he decides on a spear, but he buys two just in case he wants to throw the first one. He writes all of these on the front of his character sheet. Adam lists the spear under both melee Strikes and ranged Strikes, and he also writes the claws he gains from _wild morph_ under his melee Strikes, because he’s sure that he’ll be casting that spell a lot.
