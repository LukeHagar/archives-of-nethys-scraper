An intelligent item might be another type of item as well: it could be an artifact (like _Serithtial_ on page 112), a cursed item (page 90), or even a relic (page 94) that grows with its wielder.\n\n Introducing an intelligent item is an effective way to subtly alter the party dynamic. An intelligent item works well when its personality makes it a natural complement or foil for its partner: the PC investing, holding, or otherwise interacting with the item. An intelligent item that can communicate only with that particular PC is also a great way to engage players who are a bit quieter, or those slower to speak in a scene where all the PCs can talk to a particular NPC. Due to their inherently limited agency, intelligent items are at less of a risk for stealing the spotlight than other NPCs who travel along with the party.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1085\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1092\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1093\" />",
