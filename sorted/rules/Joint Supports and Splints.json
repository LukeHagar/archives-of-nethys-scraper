So long as the material is flexible enough to bend with the affected joint, it can make a great support or splint. Supports are used for many reasons, such as an old wound, arthritis, or bone structure conditions. They provide stability and help the joint take impact from everyday strains such as walking, crouching, and using the arms or hands, as well as even more intense exercise like fighting, rolling, jumping, and sprinting. Supports and splints rely more on roleplaying than mechanics. Consider what kind of support best meets your character's needs.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>",
