When including art objects, consider whether the PCs could discover this information and secure a greater reward. For instance, a dwarven crown might be worth 1,000 gp for its exquisite crafting, but even more to the dwarves who lost the crown of their first queen long ago. This could also be a plot hook for a later adventure.\n\n On the other hand, the materials used to make an art object, such as the paint and the canvas of a painting, are worth far less than the finished object. Some art objects on Table 2–24 include uncommon or rare precious materials, though usually not in large enough amounts for other crafting purposes. If you’re rolling randomly and don’t want to give out an uncommon or rare material, roll again or modify the description (for instance, you might change the mithral crown in the major art objects list to a gold crown). \n\n## Table 2-24: Sample Art Objects\n<row gap=\"tiny\">\n<table> <tr><td>**d%**</td><td>**Minor Art Object**</td><td>**Price**</td></tr> <tr><td>1–5</td><td>Elegant cloth
