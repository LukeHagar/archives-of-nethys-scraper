This step is best performed when the entire group is sitting together and can generate and discuss these connections with each other. You should select another character and roll on the first table to generate an inspiring connection, then determine a different character and roll on the second table to generate a challenging connection. You might choose these characters randomly, or the group might decide that each character has an inspiring connection with the character of the player sitting to the left and a challenging connection with the character of the player sitting to the right.\n\nOther players can reject a relationship connection they don’t feel fits with their vision of their own character; in this case, pick another character or a different relationship. Even though you and the other characters share a connection, only you add the skill feats from the relationships you roll to your background options.\n\n## Table 4-9: Inspiring Relationship\n<row gap=\"tiny\">\n<table><tr><td>**1d12**</td> <td>**Result**</td></tr> <tr><td>1</td><td>**Animal Helpers** When you and this character were younger, you worked together to nurse sick animals back to health.
