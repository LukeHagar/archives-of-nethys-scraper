A deeper question is what the act of using a magic item feels like. Does the world seem to emit a deep thrum for an instant as a third eye gemstone sinks into your brow and manifests as a tattoo? Do you experience a counter-intuitive icy coolness when a blast from a _[potion of dragon's breath](/Equipment.aspx?ID=185)_ explodes from your mouth? A wizard might have a step-by-step instruction list that they mentally follow when they use a staff of power—potentially out of habit or concerns for safety. Imagining how you interact with magic items, some of which possess world-altering power, can be a revealing window into how you view your place in the cosmos.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>",
