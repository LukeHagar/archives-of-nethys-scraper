These healing abilities can greatly affect the flow of a fight. Regeneration or fast healing heals some number of hits each round—usually one to one and a half hits. To determine the number of Hit Points it should restore, look at the high damage value on Table 2–10: Strike Damage (page 65) and multiply that value by the number of hits healed. For instance, if the high damage is 20, regeneration between 20 to 30 makes sense. The value should be higher if the regeneration is easy to overcome—and remember that most regeneration gets easier to overcome at higher levels. Also, you might want to decrease the creature’s total HP by double its regeneration value. Fast healing follows the same rules, but because it can’t prevent a creature’s death and there isn’t always have a way to deactivate it, you might want to give the creature more HP instead of fast healing to keep things simple.\n\n If a creature can use an ability that heals it, that ability typically restores more HP since it costs actions. An at‑will healing ability should be based on a [_heal_](/Spells.aspx?ID=148) spell 2 levels lower than the highest-level spell a creature of that level could ordinarily cast (for example, an 11th-level creature can typically cast up to 6th-level spells, so you would base its healing ability on a 4th-level _heal_ spell). If the ability both deals damage and heals, use that same baseline scale from above but with [_vampiric touch_](/Spells.aspx?ID=354) instead of _heal_.\n\n## Table 2–7: Hit Points\n<row gap=\"tiny\">\n<table> <tr><td>**Level**</td><td>**High**</td><td>**Moderate**</td><td>**Low**</td></tr> <tr><td>–1</td><td>9</td><td>8–7</td><td>6–5</td></tr> <tr><td>0</td><td>20–17</td><td>16–14</td><td>13–11</td></tr> <tr><td>1</td><td>26–24</td><td>21–19</td><td>16–14</td></tr> <tr><td>2</td><td>40–36</td><td>32–28</td><td>25–21</td></tr> <tr><td>3</td><td>59–53</td><td>48–42</td><td>37–31</td></tr> <tr><td>4</td><td>78–72</td><td>63–57</td><td>48–42</td></tr> <tr><td>5</td><td>97–91</td><td>78–72</td><td>59–53</td></tr> <tr><td>6</td><td>123–115</td><td>99–91</td><td>75–67</td></tr> <tr><td>7</td><td>148–140</td><td>119–111</td><td>90–82</td></tr> <tr><td>8</td><td>173–165</td><td>139–131</td><td>105–97</td></tr> <tr><td>9</td><td>198–190</td><td>159–151</td><td>120–112</td></tr> <tr><td>10</td><td>223–215</td><td>179–171</td><td>135–127</td></tr> <tr><td>11</td><td>248–240</td><td>199–191</td><td>150–142</td></tr> <tr><td>12</td><td>273–265</td><td>219–211</td><td>165–157</td></tr> <tr><td>13</td><td>298–290</td><td>239–231</td><td>180–172</td></tr> <tr><td>14</td><td>323–315</td><td>259–251</td><td>195–187</td></tr> <tr><td>15</td><td>348–340</td><td>279–271</td><td>210–202</td></tr> <tr><td>16</td><td>373–365</td><td>299–291</td><td>225–217</td></tr> <tr><td>17</td><td>398–390</td><td>319–311</td><td>240–232</td></tr> <tr><td>18</td><td>423–415</td><td>339–331</td><td>255–247</td></tr> <tr><td>19</td><td>448–440</td><td>359–351</td><td>270–262</td></tr> <tr><td>20</td><td>473–465</td><td>379–371</td><td>285–277</td></tr> <tr><td>21</td><td>505–495</td><td>405–395</td><td>305–295</td></tr> <tr><td>22</td><td>544–532</td><td>436–424</td><td>329–317</td></tr> <tr><td>23</td><td>581–569</td><td>466–454</td><td>351–339</td></tr> <tr><td>24</td><td>633–617</td><td>508–492</td><td>383–367</td></tr> </table></row>\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>",
