Vehicles trigger reactions when they move, just like a creature does, as do the actions of the pilot and any passengers.\n\n Creatures can rotate and turn freely, so when you play a creature, you usually don’t need to keep track of which way it’s facing. However, vehicles can’t turn on a dime, so when controlling a vehicle, you need to keep track of which direction it’s facing. This is called the vehicle’s heading.\n\n When a vehicle moves, it must move in the direction of its heading—it can’t move backwards or sideways, though it can turn gradually as it moves forward. Most vehicles can turn up to 90 degrees for every vehicle length they move forward. For example, a 10-foot-long carriage could turn left in only 10 feet. A 100-foot-long warship, however, would need 100 feet to make the same turn; given the warship’s 30-foot Speed, turning typically requires several actions’ worth of movement.\n\n Some rules specify that a vehicle must move in a straight line. This line is measured from the center of the vehicle’s front edge, and it can skew up to 45 degrees from the vehicle’s current heading.\n\n When using a vehicle in exploration mode, the vehicle’s Speed determines its travel speed just like a creature (for more information, see Table 9–2: Travel Speed on page 479 of the _Core Rulebook_). No Drive actions or piloting checks are necessary to pilot a vehicle at these speeds.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>",
