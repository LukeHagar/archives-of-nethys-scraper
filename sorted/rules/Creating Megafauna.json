Creating custom megafauna for your game world enables you, as a GM, to tailor the stories and experiences of your players, further flesh out environments your players explore, and meet player expectations, which is especially important with creatures that have clear ties to the real world but remain in the realm of imagination. Whether you want to create a little-known dinosaur, like the amargasaurus or kosmoceratops, from scratch, reskin a creature into a completely unique megafauna, or increase the size and difficulty of a mundane animal to represent a giant counterpart, the ability to create and mold the game world is at your fingertips. Creating custom megafauna follows the same steps as [creating any other creatures](/Rules.aspx?ID=995).
