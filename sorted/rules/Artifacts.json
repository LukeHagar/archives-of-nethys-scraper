Powerful weapons created in antiquity carrying the hopes of an entire people. A simple deck of cards representing fortunes both transcendent and deadly. These are artifacts—items of incredible power, spoken of in thousands of stories and beyond the capability of modern people to create.\n\n Stranger and more powerful than other magic items, artifacts can change the course of history in the right hands—or the wrong hands. Simply finding an artifact is a pivotal moment in your campaign, and its presence then ripples throughout your entire game, warping the story around it. Some entire adventures revolve around one artifact!\n\n Adding an artifact to your game should never be taken lightly. Artifacts shouldn’t be found in normal treasure hoards, even at 20th level, and you’ll need to structure moments in your plot that play into the artifact’s presence. Prepare yourself for encounters being easily overcome by the artifact. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t include such encounters, since part of the thrill of an artifact is that it breaks the normal rules! Though you should include an artifact mindfully, you should allow it to have its full impact so that it can do itself and the story of your game justice.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1107\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1109\" />",
