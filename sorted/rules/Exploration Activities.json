The purpose of these activities within the game is to clarify what a PC focuses on as they explore rather than being able to unrealistically do all things simultaneously. This adds variety within the group’s behavior and can show you where players want the story to go. For example, a player whose PC is [Investigating](/Actions.aspx?ID=516) carvings on the walls shows you that the player wants those to be informative.\n\n Exploration activities that happen continually as the group explores are meant to be narrative first and foremost, with the player describing to you what they’re doing, and then you determining which an activity applies, plus any details or alterations for the situation. If a player says, “I’m [Avoiding Notice](/Actions.aspx?ID=511),” add more detail by asking what precautions they’re taking or by telling them which passages they think are least guarded. Likewise, if a player says they’re looking for traps and keeping their shield raised and covering the group’s tracks, ask them which is most important to narrow down the activity. Consider the advantages and disadvantages of an activity given current circumstances. For instance, someone [Scouting](/Actions.aspx?ID=518) might encounter thin ice and fall through before their group can reach them, or someone Investigating ancient hieroglyphs might critically fail and lead the party in the wrong direction. This does not apply for exploration activities that are discrete and occur when the group is taking a pause or zooming in on a particular action, such as Treat Wounds. Characters can always drop out of a continual exploration activity to perform a discrete one (even if they are fatigued and can’t sustain an exploration activity as they travel), and they can change activities at any time. The _Core Rulebook_ covers how to adjudicate specific activities—[Detect Magic](/Rules.aspx?ID=523), [Follow the Expert](/Rules.aspx?ID=524), [Investigate](/Rules.aspx?ID=525), and [Search](/Rules.aspx?ID=526).\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-862\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-863\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-864\" />",
