The staff functions as a [_major staff of divination_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=353). While using the staff, you gain a +3 item bonus to [Decipher Writing](/Actions.aspx?ID=22), [Identify Magic](/Actions.aspx?ID=24), and [Recall Knowledge](/Actions.aspx?ID=26) checks, regardless of the skill. When you invest the staff, you either increase your Intelligence score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever is higher. You must select the skills and languages the first time you invest the item, and whenever you invest the same _whispering staff_, you get the same skills and languages you chose the first time.\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-1649\" />\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-1650\" />\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-1651\" />\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>",
