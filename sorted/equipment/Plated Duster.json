While these dusters can't turn away gunfire entirely, their utility, affordability, and comfort ensure their popularity, especially among the city's shieldmarshals, who have adopted them as a sort of unofficial uniform. A plated duster can be donned with 2 Interact actions or as part of donning light armor. When worn with light armor from the cloth, leather, or chain groups, a plated duster increases the armor's item bonus to AC by 1, worsens the armor's check penalty by 1, reduces the armor's Dex cap by 1, increases the Strength score required to ignore the armor check penalty and Speed penalty by 2, adds the [noisy](/Traits.aspx?ID=205) trait, and changes the armor's group to [composite](/ArmorGroups.aspx?ID=2). This also makes the armor one step heavier (from light to medium), and you use the proficiency bonus appropriate to this adjusted armor type. You can't use a plated duster alongside an [armored skirt](/Equipment.aspx?ID=514) or any other item that adjusts an armor's statistics.\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>",
