Torag designed a small number of these seals as gifts to allied good deities; each one is nearly identical but has a different spell effect when using the reaction activation; for instance, [Sarenrae’s](/Deities.aspx?ID=16) seal casts [_sunburst_](/Spells.aspx?ID=326) instead of [_earthquake_](/Spells.aspx?ID=95).\n\n A seal constantly rings with the quiet sound of a hammer striking an anvil when etched onto a [_runestone_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=247). A _Forgefather’s seal_ can be etched only onto armor that can bear two or more property runes, and it is so powerful that it takes the place of two property runes. While wearing armor etched with a _Forgefather’s seal_, you gain fire resistance 40. You ignore the armor’s check penalty and Speed penalty (if any); if the armor is light or medium, increase its item bonus to AC by 1. In addition, any shield you wield automatically recovers 10 Hit Points at the start of your turn each round.\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-394\" />\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-395\" />\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-396\" />\r\n\r\n**Destruction** Using the _Forgefather’s seal_ ability to bring the dead back to life on an evil demigod causes it to shatter in a violent explosion that destroys the seal and the statue made as part of the sacrifice, erasing all knowledge of the user from existence.
