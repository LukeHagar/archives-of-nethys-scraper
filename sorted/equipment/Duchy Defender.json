In Alkenstar's hands, the musket was used to defend the burgeoning Grand Duchy from outside threats, including [mutants](/Traits.aspx?ID=229) of the Mana Wastes, Nexian [constructs](/Traits.aspx?ID=35), and [undead](/Traits.aspx?ID=160) from Geb. After Ancil's death, the weapon was passed down, per his own decree, not to his heirs but to the greatest defender of Alkenstar, as determined by the weapon's previous owner. Over time, the devotion and heroism of each successive wielder left a psychic imprint on the weapon, until it developed an intellect and drive of its own.\n\n A _duchy defender_ is a powerful weapon with a rigid personality. It follows the laws of Alkenstar to the letter, and fights in defense of its nation. If these two priorities ever clash, a _duchy defender_ prioritizes the protection of Alkenstar and its citizens over following the laws themselves, since laws can change, but the people will always need protecting.\n\n  If you break the laws of Alkenstar, a _duchy defender_ goes out of its way to call attention to you at inopportune times, such as when you're engaged in an illegal activity, and attempts to see you pay for your crimes, up to and including outing you to law enforcement and providing testimony against you in court. If a _duchy defender_ is used unjustly against a citizen of Alkenstar, the weapon automatically misfires.\n\n If the weapon is removed from the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar without a reason that directly benefits the duchy, the _duchy defender_ transports itself away, reappearing in the hands of a previous worthy owner, or elsewhere in Alkenstar if no such previous owner lives. In the hands of a worthy owner, a _duchy defender_ is nearly impossible to steal, since it transports itself back to you at the first opportunity after someone takes it, and it grants you a +2 circumstance bonus to their Reflex DC to resist being disarmed of it.\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-971\" />\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-972\" />\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>",
