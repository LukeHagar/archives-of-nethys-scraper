An [incorporeal](/Traits.aspx?ID=222) creature can touch, hold, and carry _wraithweave patches_ (unlike most physical objects).\n\n You can Interact with a _wraithweave patch_ to securely wrap up an object or container that does not exceed the _wraithweave patch's_ capacity in Bulk (as determined by the _wraithweave patch's_ type). Once an object is wrapped up, its Bulk becomes negligible, and the _wraithweave patch_ appears and behaves as if it's nothing more than a tightly folded but empty piece of cloth. You must Interact with the _wraithweave patch_ again to unfold it, at which point the wrapped object returns to its normal Bulk and can itself be interacted with again.\n\n Creatures wrapped in a _wraithweave patch_ are not affected and treat the patch as normal cloth. A wrapped item provides no benefits until it is unwrapped, but can be detected by magic normally. If the _wraithweave patch_ is destroyed, any object it contains reverts to normal and is exposed to the damage or effect that destroyed the _wraithweave patch_.\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-1288\" />\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n<title\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nright=\"Item 9\"\r\npfs=\"Standard\"\r\n>\r\nWraithweave Patch (Type I)\r\n</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #184: The Ghouls Hunger](/Sources.aspx?ID=147) pg. 81</row>\n\n**Price** 600 gp\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n**Bulk** L\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Capacity** Light Bulk\r\n\r\n<title\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nright=\"Item 12\"\r\npfs=\"Standard\"\r\n>\r\nWraithweave Patch (Type II)\r\n</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #184: The Ghouls Hunger](/Sources.aspx?ID=147) pg. 81</row>\n\n**Price** 1,750 gp\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n**Bulk** L\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Capacity** 1 Bulk\r\n\r\n<title\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nright=\"Item 15\"\r\npfs=\"Standard\"\r\n>\r\nWraithweave Patch (Type III)\r\n</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #184: The Ghouls Hunger](/Sources.aspx?ID=147) pg. 81</row>\n\n**Price** 6,000 gp\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n**Bulk** L\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Capacity** 2 Bulk",
