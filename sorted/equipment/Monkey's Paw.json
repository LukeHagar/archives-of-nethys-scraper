When you pick up the _monkey’s paw_, the hand opens, revealing three withered fingers. The _monkey’s paw_ grants you three wishes, curling one finger after every one. Once you pick up the _monkey’s paw_, you cannot discard the hand until it returns to a clenched fist by casting its three wishes. Any attempts to discard the hand, even with the effects of a [_miracle_](/Spells.aspx?ID=196) or [_wish_](/Spells.aspx?ID=377) spell, are unsuccessful as the _monkey’s paw_ reappears among your possessions within 1d4 hours; it doesn’t work for any other creature in the intervening time. The hand returns even if another creature steals it from you. Once you make all three wishes, the _monkey’s paw_ uses [_plane shift_](/Spells.aspx?ID=222) to travel to a random point in the multiverse.\n\n Whenever the _monkey’s paw_ hears you utter a statement that sounds like a wish, even if you don’t use the words “I wish,” it activates and grants a twisted, horrifying version of your wish, producing any effect within the possibility of [_alter reality_](/Spells.aspx?ID=8), _miracle_, [_primal phenomenon_](/Spells.aspx?ID=231), or _wish_, and potentially a greater effect at the GM’s discretion.\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>",
