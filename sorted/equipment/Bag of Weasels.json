The weasel has no loyalty to you and typically attempts to escape as quickly as possible. If the weasel is targeted with a [_remove curse_](/Spells.aspx?ID=250) spell or a similar magical effect, it transforms back into the original item that was taken from the _bag of weasels_. If it dies or is slain, the weasel disappears and the item is permanently destroyed. Because the weasel is a transformed item, you don’t gain any benefit you would receive from attacking a creature, defeating one, damaging one, or the like, but you do gain any benefit you would gain from destroying an item.\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>",
