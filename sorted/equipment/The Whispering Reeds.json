According to the introduction, the author's original intent was to create a work that foes of the Empty Death could use to fight against her influence, but as one reads through the book, it becomes apparent that the opposite effect has been achieved—by compiling these stories, the author inadvertently generated a work that made it easier for Nhimbaloth to influence the world. Those who venerate the Empty Death seek copies of this book to use as a guide and religious text, while those who don't know better and peruse the book as though it were merely an anthology of stories find themselves unwittingly falling prey to Nhimbaloth's cult or agents of the entity herself. Those who study from _The Whispering Reeds_ for too long are often cursed to rise as [ghosts](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=51) after death— though their existence never lasts for long, as they are inevitably consumed by Nhimbaloth.\n\n If a character understands the dangers of this book, however, moderated use can stall or even prevent such a fate from befalling them. If a character takes special care, they can even potentially use _The Whispering Reeds_ for its original purpose—as a weapon against the cult of Nhimbaloth. Using the text too often or leveraging some of its more powerful effects, however, causes the user to feel an ominous chill. In these cases, the user is exposed to the tome's curse, Empty Death (see below).\n\n The anonymous compiler wanted to produce an enormous print run of The Whispering Reeds, but after the initial run they realized the danger and scuttled those plans, instead attempting to destroy those copies already created. This crusade caught the attention of Nhimbaloth's cult, who swiftly assassinated the compiler. Fewer than two dozen copies of this rare tome are believed to still exist. The book's sinister nature causes all attempts to transcribe it to fail, resulting in bodies of gibberish, nonsense text.\n\n _The Whispering Reeds_ provides several abilities, but you can't activate any of them while you are [stupefied](/Conditions.aspx?ID=37) unless you are a follower of Nhimbaloth.\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-696\" />\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-697\" />\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-698\" />\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-699\" />\n\n **Empty Death** ([curse](/Traits.aspx?ID=38), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117), [occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120)) **Saving Throw** DC 27 Will; **Effect** If you activate _The Whispering Reeds_ and are not a worshipper of Nhimbaloth, you become stupefied 2 for 24 hours as your thoughts fill with paranoia that something is watching you from the other side of death. If you die while affected by the Empty Death, you immediately become a chaotic evil ghost. Every 7 days that pass after you become a ghost, you must succeed at a DC 2 flat check— failure indicates that you are consumed by Nhimbaloth. A creature whose ghost is consumed in this way does not travel to the River of Souls and is utterly annihilated; this creature can only be restored to life via a 10th-level spell effect or ritual like [_wish_](/Spells.aspx?ID=377).\r\n\r\n**Destruction** Copies of _The Whispering Reeds_ have no special protections and can be destroyed like any regular book, but doing so exposes the one who destroyed the book to the Empty Death. \n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>",
