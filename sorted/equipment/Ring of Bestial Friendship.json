The ring of bestial friendship was created by Nyrissa for a specific reason: to allow her pawn Eirikk to manipulate the beasts of the Stolen Lands so as to sow discord among the PCs' nascent kingdom. As long as someone wears it, she can use spells like [_discern location_](/Spells.aspx?ID=75) and [_scrying_](/Spells.aspx?ID=268) on that person as if she possessed a part of their body. This effect does not work in reverse, despite being crafted from a lock of Nyrissa's hair. Instead, any attempt to use the ring as a body part to aid in casting a spell causes the ring instead to explode into a blast of lightning that causes 6d6 electricity damage to all creatures within 20 feet (DC 20 [basic](/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Reflex save). This destroys the ring and automatically [counteracts](/Rules.aspx?ID=371) the spell effect that triggered the explosion.\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-1359\" />\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>",
