When light from the lantern passes through the lens, it alters the light to make it easier to perform a common exploration activity with the lantern. You can find more information about exploration activities related to these lenses on page 496 of the Core Rulebook. Alternatively, an _exploration lens_ can be installed in a [_wayfinder_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=470) like an [_aeon stone_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=407). In this case, light (such as that from a lantern, [torch](/Equipment.aspx?ID=60), or [_light_](/Spells.aspx?ID=171) spell) must still pass through the lens and you must hold the _wayfinder_ in your hand for it to function.\n\n There are several different types of exploration lens, each granting benefits with a different type of exploration activity. Each type of lens is distinguishable from all the other types by holding it up to a bright light.\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n<title\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nright=\"Item 10\"\r\npfs=\"Limited\"\r\n>\r\nExploration Lens (Detecting)\r\n</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #171: Hurricane's Howl](/Sources.aspx?ID=101) pg. 76</row>\n\n**Price** 1,000 gp\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhen held up to light, this lens sparkles as though infused with glitter.
