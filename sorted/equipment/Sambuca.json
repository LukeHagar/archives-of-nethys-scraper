The sambuca is then mounted across the ships on one end with its length suspended upward, and attached to pulleys fastened to the tops of the ships' masts. Once the ships are moved into position, the sambuca can be lowered to rest on a battlement or other surface, allowing troops to rush from the ships onto their intended destination.\n\n The sambuca has AC 17, Fort +11, Ref +5, Hardness 8, HP 32 (BT 16), and object immunities. It's covered on all sides to protect those who cross, granting them greater cover. The end of the sambuca can be lowered by teams operating the pulleys in concert. This requires three crew members on each ship, and they can lower the far end of the sambuca by 15 feet each round they work.\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>",
