A bottle of colorful coating contains enough to slather over one 5-foot square within your reach or space and is made with a special dispenser that enables you to coat the surface using only one hand. It's possible to use the coating on any surface that can be painted (subject to the GM's discretion). Colorful coating dries instantly, and its effect in the square you coated lasts for 1 minute. After that time, the coating turns to fine, inert powder, returning the square to its original condition unless otherwise noted.\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n<title\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nright=\"Item 3\"\r\npfs=\"Standard\"\r\n>\r\nColorful Coating (Blue)\r\n</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Treasure Vault](/Sources.aspx?ID=191) pg. 52 <sup>1.1</sup></row>\n\n**Price** 8 gp\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n**Bulk** L\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBlue colorful coating contains bonding compounds that firm up a surface, making it more stable and more supportive of weight. When applied to material that's loose or unstable, the square can hold twice as much weight before giving way. The coating also slows any collapse, making it easier to avoid and granting a +1 circumstance bonus to Reflex saving throws in reaction to the coated surface's collapse.\n\n This coating can shore up a wall, ceiling, door, or similar opening, granting a +2 circumstance bonus to the DC for [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) checks to [Force Open](/Actions.aspx?ID=34) the coated surface.\r\n\r\n<title\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nright=\"Item 3\"\r\npfs=\"Standard\"\r\n>\r\nColorful Coating (Green)\r\n</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Treasure Vault](/Sources.aspx?ID=191) pg. 52 <sup>1.1</sup></row>\n\n**Price** 10 gp\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n**Bulk** L\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nGreen colorful coating dries into a low-friction surface.

If it was moving horizontally, its bounce continues in the same direction, with a distance determined by the GM. If the coating is on a wall, a creature [pushed](/Rules.aspx?ID=451) or [Shoved](/Actions.aspx?ID=38) into the wall bounces back half again as far and avoids taking any damage from being pushed into the wall.

A square of this coating is difficult terrain. Any creature that enters the square must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save or take a –15-foot penalty to its Speeds until the end of its next turn. On a critical failure, the creature is [immobilized](/Conditions.aspx?ID=24) in the square until the end of its next turn. The target can end these effects by [Escaping](/Actions.aspx?ID=79) (DC 20) or spending 2 Interact actions to remove the sticky substances.

On the affected surface, the coating reduces difficult terrain caused by slipperiness, such as from ice or grease; this eliminates difficult terrain, reduces greater difficult terrain to difficult terrain, and reduces [uneven ground](/Rules.aspx?ID=456) to greater difficult terrain. The coating can't affect difficult terrain caused by features or effects not part of the surface, such as crowds, underbrush, wind, magic, and so on. The GM determines if yellow colorful coating can affect a surface's terrain.\n\n The coating also makes a coated wall or ceiling easier to climb. It provides a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to Climb the coated surface.",
