You must be trained in [Performance](/Skills.aspx?ID=12) to properly compose this missive (or trained in an appropriate [Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) skill your GM allows). You choose one of the emotions described below and write a musical composition to convey that emotion about a subject of your choice, typically a person or group. When activated, the missive plays a note-perfect rendition of the inscribed score. Each creature that can hear the score must succeed at a DC 28 Will save or be influenced to feel the emotion you chose toward the subject of your composition. This lasts for 1 hour, typically returning the creature to its initial attitude unless new events have altered their attitude long-term. \n<ul><li>**Positive** Your song engenders sympathy, adoration, joy, or a similar emotion. An affected creature's attitude toward the subject improves by one step, such as from [indifferent](/Conditions.aspx?ID=25) to [friendly](/Conditions.aspx?ID=18).</li><li>**Negative** Your song spurs anger, sadness, jealousy, or a similar emotion. An affected creature's attitude toward the subject worsens by one step, such as from indifferent to [unfriendly](/Conditions.aspx?ID=40).</li></ul> When composing this missive, you can add a small notation or illustration of a type of instrument.
