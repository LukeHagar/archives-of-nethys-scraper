If those whom you use the orb to scry on roll better than a critical failure on their saving throw, they receive a telepathic message alerting them to the scrying. A success or better at the save allows the target to choose to allow you to scry anyway, knowing they can use an aspect of the orb against you, according to the orb's type. A creature that rolls a critical success on the saving throw also learns your name and location. Once you Activate a _tattletale orb_ or use it to cast one of your scrying spells, it fuses to you. You must succeed at a Will save, using the scrying Will DC of a _crystal ball_ of the orb's type, to use another such device.\n\n _Tattletale orbs_ come in the same types as _crystal balls_, with the same activations and powers. However, your target must roll a critical failure on the saving throw for the orb to function as normal for that type of _crystal ball_.\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n<title\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nright=\"Item 14\"\r\npfs=\"\"\r\n>\r\nTattletale Orb (Clear Quartz)\r\n</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Treasure Vault](/Sources.aspx?ID=191) pg. 193 <sup>1.1</sup></row>\n\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n**Bulk** 1\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n<title\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nright=\"Item 15\"\r\npfs=\"\"\r\n>\r\nTattletale Orb (Selenite)\r\n</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Treasure Vault](/Sources.aspx?ID=191) pg. 193 <sup>1.1</sup></row>\n\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n**Bulk** 1\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe target is temporarily immune to the orb's [_see invisibility_](/Spells.aspx?ID=271) for 24 hours and can choose to be invisible to the orb's scrying during that time.\r\n\r\n<title\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nright=\"Item 16\"\r\npfs=\"\"\r\n>\r\nTattletale Orb (Moonstone)\r\n</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Treasure Vault](/Sources.aspx?ID=191) pg. 193 <sup>1.1</sup></row>\n\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n**Bulk** 1\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe target is temporarily immune to the orb's [_mind reading_](/Spells.aspx?ID=194) for 24 hours and can use _mind reading_ against you instead, as if the target used the orb.\r\n\r\n<title\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nright=\"Item 17\"\r\npfs=\"\"\r\n>\r\nTattletale Orb (Peridot)\r\n</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Treasure Vault](/Sources.aspx?ID=191) pg. 193 <sup>1.1</sup></row>\n\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n**Bulk** 1\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe target can send you one [_telepathic demand_](/Spells.aspx?ID=336).\r\n\r\n<title\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nright=\"Item 19\"\r\npfs=\"\"\r\n>\r\nTattletale Orb (Obsidian)\r\n</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Treasure Vault](/Sources.aspx?ID=191) pg. 193 <sup>1.1</sup></row>\n\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n**Bulk** 1\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe target is temporarily immune to the orb's [_true seeing_](/Spells.aspx?ID=344) for 24 hours.
