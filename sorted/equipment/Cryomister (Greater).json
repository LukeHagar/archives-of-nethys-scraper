Once you've done so, the metallic device instantly disperses a heavy mist, settling quickly on nearby flat surfaces and forming a sheet of ice. The cryomister creates a burst with a radius depending on the type, making the affected area difficult terrain for 1 minute; at the GM's discretion, however, this duration might be reduced in unusually hot conditions or increased in unusually cold ones. If an affected square takes fire damage, the difficult terrain is removed. Though not designed as a weapon, the cryomister's rapidly cooling mist deals cold [splash](/Traits.aspx?ID=150) damage depending on the type to creatures in the area on activation. Creatures attempting to move through the affected area can attempt an [Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) check with a DC depending on the type to ignore the difficult terrain and move at their normal Speed. Throwing the cryomister onto the surface of a liquid creates a floating piece of ice for the same duration, capable of supporting one or more creatures of the listed size.\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n<title\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nright=\"Item 1\"\r\npfs=\"Standard\"\r\n>\r\nCryomister (Lesser)\r\n</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Guns &amp; Gears](/Sources.aspx?ID=98) pg. 68</row>\n\n**Price** 3 gp\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n**Bulk** L\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe area is a 5-foot burst, the Acrobatics DC is 17, and the cold splash damage is 1.
