They silence both the loud gunshot and the screams of creatures wounded by its shot. A weapon with a _golden silencer_ attached emits no light and makes no noise when fired. A target hit by a ranged Strike from the affixed weapon must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be silenced as well until the start of its next turn. A silenced creature can't call for help or use sonic abilities, nor can it use abilities with the [auditory](/Traits.aspx?ID=16) trait.
