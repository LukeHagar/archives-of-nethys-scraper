While uncomfortable to wear, the crown beguiles those within the wearer's presence. Creatures within 30 feet of you automatically improve their attitude toward you by one step (up to [friendly](/Conditions.aspx?ID=18)). This doesn't prevent [hostile](/Conditions.aspx?ID=23) creatures from attacking you, but it might give you a chance to talk to them before they strike. The dazzling nature of the crown makes it hard for you to read the intentions of others, and you take a –4 status penalty to your Perception DC when someone uses [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) against you. When you invest the crown, you either increase your Charisma score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever is higher.\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-1627\" />\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-1628\" />\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-1629\" />\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>",
