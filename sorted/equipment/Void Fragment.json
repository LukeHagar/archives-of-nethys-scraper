It thrums intermittently with a beckoning vibration, drawing attention from and pulling at nearby creatures with a tangible sense of gravity. A chill hangs in the air around it. At a touch, the wisp vanishes, giving the point of contact a gangrenous color. If the partaker succeeds at the initial save, the wisp reappears somewhere on the same planet.\n\n---\n\n<br /> **Stage 1 (8 Days)** The first time you enter this stage from a given void fragment, you gain the effect of a [_potion of tongues_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=194) for 3 days. The wisp grants you [telepathy](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=37) with a range of 30 feet. Also, you are under the effects of [_mind blank_](/Spells.aspx?ID=192), except that its status bonus is +1 and it [counteracts](/Rules.aspx?ID=371) with a bonus equal to your class DC – 9. The wisp grants you resistance to [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106) damage equal to half your level.

However, you have a tough time filtering the mental noise. If any creatures can be detected by your thoughtsense, you take a –1 penalty to Perception checks.

This emanation can affect you.\n\n If you die at this stage or higher, your body implodes. Your soul reincarnates as an [aberration](/Traits.aspx?ID=1) of a level close to yours, which extrudes from the location of your implosion.

This creature isn't you, but fleeting memories of your former existence remain with it. You can't be raised from the dead while this monster endures. Its alignment is chaotic evil. The _void fragment_ reappears somewhere on the same planet.\n\n---\n\n<br /> **Stage 3 (32 Days)** Your telepathy range increases to 100 feet, and the wisp grants you resistance to [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106) damage equal to your level. The mental noise increases the penalty to Perception to –2.
