When you have a noqual shield [Raised](/Actions.aspx?ID=98), you gain its circumstance bonus to saving throws against spells that target you (as well as AC). Additionally, while the shield is Raised, when an opponent casting a spell that targets you critically fails a spell attack roll against your AC, you can reflect the spell back toward them as a reaction. Attempt a ranged attack roll against the triggering creature using your highest proficiency with a ranged weapon. If you succeed, your opponent takes the effects of a successful spell attack roll for their own spell (or the effects of a critical success if your attack roll was a critical success).\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n<title\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nright=\"Item 17\"\r\npfs=\"Standard\"\r\n>\r\nNoqual Buckler (High-Grade)\r\n</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Grand Bazaar](/Sources.aspx?ID=100) pg. 100</row>\n\n**Price** 14,000 gp\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n**Bulk** L\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe shield has Hardness 7, HP 28, and BT 14.\n\n**Craft Requirements** noqual worth at least 7,000 gp\r\n\r\n<title\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nright=\"Item 17\"\r\npfs=\"Standard\"\r\n>\r\nNoqual Shield (High-Grade)\r\n</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Grand Bazaar](/Sources.aspx?ID=100) pg. 100</row>\n\n**Price** 15,400 gp\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n**Bulk** 1\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe shield has Hardness 10, HP 40, and BT 20.\n\n**Craft Requirements** noqual worth at least 7,700 gp",
