When you enter an area that contains creatures within 60 feet that are unnoticed to you, the GM rolls a [secret](/Traits.aspx?ID=142) Perception check for you against the creatures' [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) DCs. On a success, the creature becomes [undetected](/Conditions.aspx?ID=39) by you, rather than [unnoticed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=41), and on a critical success, the creature becomes [hidden](/Conditions.aspx?ID=22) to you. All creatures in the area are then temporarily immune to your _crown of insight_ for 24 hours. The _crown of insight_ doesn't help you find hidden items or traps, nor can it help you discern a creature hiding in plain sight, such as a [gargoyle](/Monsters.aspx?ID=210) pretending to be an inanimate statue. Additionally, since the effect occurs when you move to enter an area that contains creatures, it doesn't detect an unnoticed creature [Sneaking](/Actions.aspx?ID=63) up on you.\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>",
