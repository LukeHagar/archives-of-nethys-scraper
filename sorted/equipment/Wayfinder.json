It serves as a badge of office for agents of the Pathfinder Society and as a status symbol among adventurers of any stripe. A _wayfinder_ functions as a compass.\n\n An indentation in the middle of the _wayfinder_ can hold a single _aeon stone_. Placing an _aeon stone_ in this indentation provides you all the benefits of having the _aeon stone_ orbiting your head, but it protects the stone from being noticed or stolen as easily. You invest a _wayfinder_ and the _aeon stone_ within it simultaneously, and they count as only one item toward your investiture limit. An invested _aeon stone_ slotted in a _wayfinder_ also grants its resonant power.\n\n If you have more than one _wayfinder_ with an invested _aeon stone_ on your person at a given time, destructive interference from their resonance prevents you from gaining benefits from any of them. You can still benefit from additional _aeon stones_ orbiting your head, just not in _wayfinders_.\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-282\" />\r\n\r\n<title\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nright=\"Item 2\"\r\npfs=\"Standard\"\r\n>\r\nArchaic Wayfinder\r\n</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Evocation\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=65\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Invested\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=98\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Magical\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=103\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [World Guide](/Sources.aspx?ID=6) pg. 17 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\r\n\r\n_[**PFS Note**](/pathfinder-society) All characters have access to the archaic wayfinder_\r\n\r\n**Price** 30 gp\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n**Usage** held in 1 hand\n\n</row>\n\n<row gap=\"tiny\"><row>**Activate**</row><actions string=\"\" /><row>Cast a Spell</row></row>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAn _archaic wayfinder_ functions as a compass and acts as a repository for one cantrip cast into it.

Activating an _archaic wayfinder_ is the same as the casting for the relevant spell. Once it has been activated, it becomes empty again.
