Having a proxy activate the _gift of the poisoned heart_ is of no use, as the item's magic sniffs out all coconspirators and uses your attempt to avoid the drawback to feed the resurrected creature's paranoia.\n\n No amount of information or persuasion can alleviate this mistrust, as the cursed creature twists the facts endlessly to fit their delusion. Only magic such as [_remove curse_](/Spells.aspx?ID=250) can neutralize this effect, and the subject resists any attempt to alter their beliefs by magic.\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>",
