When emptied into an adjacent body of water, the pellets freeze the water's surface almost instantly, creating an ice block in a 10-foot square to a depth of 1 foot. Any creatures inside this space must attempt a DC 23 Reflex save. On a failure, the creature takes 2d6 cold damage and is [immobilized](/Conditions.aspx?ID=24) for 1 minute or until it [Escapes](/Actions.aspx?ID=79) (DC 20) or the ice is broken. The entire ice block has AC 10, Hardness 10, and 40 Hit Points, and it's immune to critical hits, [cold](/Traits.aspx?ID=27) damage, and precision damage. The ice is strong enough to support one Large creature or up to four Medium or Small creatures. Traversing the slippery ice requires a successful DC 20 [Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) check to [Balance](/Actions.aspx?ID=28).\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n<title\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nright=\"Item 7\"\r\npfs=\"Standard\"\r\n>\r\nCold Comfort (Lesser)\r\n</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Grand Bazaar](/Sources.aspx?ID=100) pg. 18</row>\n\n**Price** 70 gp\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n**Bulk** L\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIce created by the pellets lasts for 1 hour or until broken.\r\n\r\n<title\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nright=\"Item 15\"\r\npfs=\"Standard\"\r\n>\r\nCold Comfort (Greater)\r\n</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Grand Bazaar](/Sources.aspx?ID=100) pg. 18</row>\n\n**Price** 1,300 gp\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n**Bulk** L\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe area increases to a 20-foot square, the save DC increases to 34, the cold damage increases to 4d6 and the Escape DC increases to 31.
