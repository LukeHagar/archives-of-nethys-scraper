It is believed that orbs for other types of true dragons exist, though that theory is yet to be confirmed.\n\n While holding an _orb of dragonkind_, you are immune to the breath weapon of the dragon variety associated with the orb. An _orb of dragonkind_ also grants a number of additional senses. You can communicate verbally and visually with the bearers of other orbs as if you were in the same room with them. You know if there are any dragons within 10 miles of you at all times; this extends to 100 miles for dragons of the type associated with the orb. If an associated dragon is within 1 mile, you know which direction the dragon is from you and the dragon’s age, such as young, adult, or ancient. Each orb grants a 10th-level arcane innate spell that you can cast at will, determined by the specific orb.\n\nThe _Orb of Gold Dragonkind_ can convey the innate spells of any of the other orbs, as well as their activated abilities, but it can grant each individual power only once per day. In addition, the bearer of the gold orb can use its 3-action activation to attempt to cast [_dominate_](/Spells.aspx?ID=87) on the bearer of another orb if they are within 1 mile, as if that bearer were a dragon of the associated type within 500 feet. The last reports of the _Orb of Gold Dragonkind_ on Golarion indicate the orb has been destroyed, however. GMs running campaigns in settings other than the Age of Lost Omens might decide the gold orb is still intact for their campaigns.\n\n Bearing an _orb of dragonkind_ earns you the enmity of all dragonkind forever because you profited from the enslavement of the dragon within the orb, even if you later lose the orb.\n\n **Spell Granted** (DC 40) black dragon ([_darkness_](/Spells.aspx?ID=59)), blue dragon ([_hallucinatory terrain_](/Spells.aspx?ID=145)), brass dragon ([_speak with animals_](/Spells.aspx?ID=293)), bronze dragon ([_control water_](/Spells.aspx?ID=51)), copper dragon ([_hideous laughter_](/Spells.aspx?ID=150)), green dragon ([_entangle_](/Spells.aspx?ID=103)), red dragon ([_wall of fire_](/Spells.aspx?ID=362)), silver dragon ([_detect alignment_ [evil only])](/Spells.aspx?ID=65), white dragon ([_wall of ice_](/Spells.aspx?ID=364))\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-401\" />\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-402\" />\r\n\r\n**Destruction** An _orb of dragonkind_ violently shatters and explodes when exposed to the Breath Weapon of a dragon who is a descendant of the dragon trapped within.

The _Orb of Gold Dragonkind_ was the most powerful of them all, until it was shattered by Mengkare’s draconic breath. Reconstructed at great expense by enslaved spellcasters toiling under the Scarlet Triad’s watch, the _Flawed Orb of Gold Dragonkind_ is a shadow of its prior self, yet it remains a potent weapon against dragons of all types.\n\n While carried, the _Flawed Orb of Gold Dragonkind_ grants its owner resistance 30 to the Breath Weapons of [gold dragons](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=35). The owner also can sense if there are any dragons within 10 miles, or any gold dragons within 100 miles. When within 1 mile of a dragon, they can determine the direction to the dragon and the dragon’s age category (such as young, ancient, or wyrm).\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-350\" />\r\n\r\n**Destruction** The _Flawed Orb of Gold Dragonkind_ is resilient, but its imperfect nature leaves it vulnerable.
