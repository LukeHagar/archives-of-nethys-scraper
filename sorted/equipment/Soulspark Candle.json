When lit, the candle sheds [bright light](/Rules.aspx?ID=407) for 20 feet and [dim light](/Rules.aspx?ID=408) for a further 20 feet. The candle can't be snuffed by weather, water, or accident but can be purposefully snuffed through ritual prayer. The candle doesn't release heat and can't be used to start a fire. The candle is never exhausted, regardless of how long it burns.\n\n The area within the candle's light is a consecrated space. Worshippers of [Pharasma](/Deities.aspx?ID=14) within this area gain a +3 status bonus to attack rolls, skill checks, saving throws, and Perception checks. [Undead](/Traits.aspx?ID=160) creatures and worshippers of [Urgathoa](/Deities.aspx?ID=19) within this area take a –3 status penalty to those checks.\n\n When an undead creature or a [haunt](/Traits.aspx?ID=88) comes within the light of a _soulspark candle_, the candle's flame turns from red to black, makes a loud crackling sound, and releases a flash of bright sparks. The candle continues to burn black and crackle for as long as a haunt or undead remains in the area.\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-1513\" />\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-1514\" />\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-1515\" />\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-1516\" />\r\n\r\n**Destruction** If a _soulspark candle_ is lit by an undead of at least 20th level that worships Urgathoa, the candle burns down as if it were a normal candle over the course of 48 hours.
