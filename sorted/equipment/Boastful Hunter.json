A _boastful hunter_ enjoys tracking and hunting animals of all kinds but takes particular pleasure in taking down large, dangerous, or rare animals. Against an [animal](/Traits.aspx?ID=9), the _boastful hunter_ deals 1d6 additional damage. On a critical hit against an animal, the _boastful hunter_ also deals 1d6 [persistent bleed damage](/Conditions.aspx?ID=29).\n\n A _boastful hunter_ urges you to face off against tougher and tougher creatures—a challenge the ambitious rifle may not be adequate to deal with. If the _boastful hunter_ goes one week without participating in a hunt against an animal of at least your level, it becomes bored. A bored _boastful hunter_ complains incessantly and imposes a –1 item penalty to attack rolls against non-animal targets. A bored _boastful hunter_ can be appeased by using it in combat against an animal of at least your level.\n\n Unable to accept its own weaknesses, a _boastful hunter_ blames any failed hunts on you, and considers remarks about its strength or quality a terrible insult. An insulted _boastful hunter_ badmouths you to sentient creatures you interact with, imposing a –1 item penalty to [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5), [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6), and [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) skill checks, and all attacks with it incur a misfire chance until the weapon is appeased. An insulted _boastful hunter_ can be appeased by complimenting it and succeeding at a Diplomacy check against its Will DC two days in a row. You can only attempt a Diplomacy check to appease the _boastful hunter_ once each day.\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>",
