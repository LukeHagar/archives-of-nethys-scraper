This additional weight does not cause the stone to deal more damage if thrown or used as a weapon. It reappears in your possessions within 1 minute if you discard it, and can’t be destroyed or thrown away permanently, or even placed in a container that would reduce or negate its Bulk (like a [_bag of holding_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=249)), until it is subject to a [_remove curse_](/Spells.aspx?ID=250) spell or similar magic effect.
