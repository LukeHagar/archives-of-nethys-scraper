This ever-burning spirit keeps the firearm warm to the touch, regardless of surrounding environment.\n\n No matter how much you clean and maintain it, an _immolation clan pistol_ is always at risk of a misfire, and the flat check to avoid a misfire is DC 7 rather than DC 5. On a misfire, an _immolation hand cannon_ releases a blast of concentrated fire, dealing you 2d6 fire damage and 2d6 [persistent fire damage](/Conditions.aspx?ID=29).\n\n An _immolation clan pistol_ fuses with you when you first fire it. While you're fused with the _immolation clan pistol_, the pained spirit haunts your dreams, forcing you to relive its death each night. If you fired the _immolation clan pistol_ that day, you are unharmed by these dreams. If you didn't fire the _immolation clan pistol_ that day, but still possess it, you awaken fatigued. If you no longer possess the _immolation clan pistol_, the spirit of its dwarven smith is enraged by your neglect; you awaken fatigued and aflame, taking 2d6 persistent fire damage.\n\n Regardless, these nightmares possess clues to the spirit's life. If you take the _immolation hand cannon_ to the site of its creation and repair it with tools belonging to the tormented spirit, you might be able to break the curse.
