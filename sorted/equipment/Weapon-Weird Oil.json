The oil creates a synergy between skill and weapon, enabling you to wield the weapon in unexpected ways. You must have proficiency with the original weapon to benefit from the oil; however, you use your proficiency rank with the oil's keyed group instead of the weapon's original group. Also, you apply the [critical specialization effect](/Rules.aspx?ID=235) from the oil's keyed group instead of the weapon's normal critical specialization effect. While the oil remains effective, the [_grievous_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=298) rune and similar magic react as if the weapon belongs to the oil's group. A weapon can be coated in only one type of _weapon-weird oil_ at a time. Any new application of this oil supersedes any previous one. These effects last for 1 hour.\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>",
