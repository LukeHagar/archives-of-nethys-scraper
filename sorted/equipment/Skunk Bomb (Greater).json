The bomb grants an item bonus to attack rolls and deals poison damage and poison splash damage.

Creatures in the splash area treat the results of their saving throw as one step better.\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.<br />\n**Success** The target is [sickened 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=34).<br />\n**Failure** The target is sickened 1 and [slowed 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=35) while sickened.<br />\n**Critical Failure** The target is [blinded](/Conditions.aspx?ID=1) for 1 round, sickened 2, and slowed 1 while sickened.\n\nCreatures sickened by the bomb emit an odor that lasts 10 minutes after the sickened condition ends (or 1 hour if they were also blinded). The odor can be removed or neutralized by using [_prestidigitation_](/Spells.aspx?ID=229) or similar magic or by spending 10 minutes scrubbing with ample soap and water. While the odor lasts, creatures within 30 feet can smell the target, enabling even those with a weak sense of smell to detect its presence, and all creatures gain a +1 item bonus to [Track](/Actions.aspx?ID=66) the affected creature for as long as it has the odor. A creature that has [imprecise](/Rules.aspx?ID=412) or [precise](/Rules.aspx?ID=411) [scent](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=33) doubles the range at which it can detect the target using this scent.\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n<title\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nright=\"Item 1\"\r\npfs=\"Standard\"\r\n>\r\nSkunk Bomb (Lesser)\r\n</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Treasure Vault](/Sources.aspx?ID=191) pg. 45 <sup>1.1</sup></row>\n\n**Price** 4 gp\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n**Bulk** L\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe bomb deals 1d4 poison damage and 1 poison splash damage.
