The lamp's flame can be covered or hidden, but it can't be smothered or quenched. While uncovered, the _Primordial Flame_ sheds bright light in a 100-foot radius (and dim light for the next 100 feet). If the light passes through an area of magical [darkness](/Traits.aspx?ID=39) or targets a creature affected by magical darkness, the _Primordial Flame_ attempts to [counteract](/Rules.aspx?ID=371) the darkness with a counteract level of 10 and a counteract modifier of +35.\n\n The presence of the _Primordial Flame_ alters the surrounding environment, changing weather patterns, temperature, climate, and even seasons. Within a 10-mile radius of the _Primordial Flame_, the temperature remains 70° F (21° C) during the day and 60° F (16° C) at night. The weather is calm and free from extreme weather conditions (such as blizzards, hail, thunderstorms, and tornadoes), and the sky remains clear. Plants in the area flourish as if they were receiving optimal sunlight, water, and nutrients for their species, despite the lack of precipitation. If the _Primordial Flame_ remains in the same region for an extended time, the area of this effect increases (typically by 1 mile each year, though terrain and other factors might alter this limit). During the time Venexus carried the _Primordial Flame_, its environmental reach expanded to cover the entirety of Lost Mammoth Valley.\n\n **Cursed** The _Primordial Flame_ was cursed by Syarstik Painted-Tiger, the guardian spirit of Red Cat Cave. As long as it remains cursed, a creature that holds the _Primordial Flame_ can't willingly give up possession. A creature that has held the _Primordial Flame_ and no longer has it in their possession is wracked with mental anguish, becoming [clumsy 4](/Conditions.aspx?ID=3), [enfeebled 4](/Conditions.aspx?ID=13), [stupefied 4](/Conditions.aspx?ID=37), and [fatigued](/Conditions.aspx?ID=15); these conditions can't be reduced or removed until the creature regains possession of the _Primordial Flame_ or the curse is removed. The curse can be removed only by avenging Syarstik.\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-1133\" />\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-1134\" />\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-1135\" />\r\n\r\n**Destruction** If used to slay a herald of Sister Cinder while on the [Shadow Plane](/Planes.aspx?ID=11), the _Primordial Flame_ is destroyed.\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>",
