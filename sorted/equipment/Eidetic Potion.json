When you drink this potion, for 1 round, anything you observe becomes locked into your memory. You can recall the memory perfectly and gain a +2 status bonus to create representations of that memory, whether using [Crafting](/Skills.aspx?ID=4) to create an artistic rendition or [Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14) to create a [Forgery](/Actions.aspx?ID=60). The memory remains locked for 1 week or until you benefit from the bonus it imparts for the first time, whichever comes first; afterward, it becomes a normal, fallible memory. You can only have a single memory locked in your mind at a time. Using this potion while you have a locked memory from a previous use makes the previously locked memory fallible but allows you to lock a new memory.\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>",
