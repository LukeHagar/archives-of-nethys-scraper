All spirit-singers can be used as musical instruments by manipulating the sensitivity to ethereal energies. However, they have an even greater benefit in areas heavy with spiritual essence. When played in the presence of a significant spiritual disturbance, such as a [haunt](/Traits.aspx?ID=88) or an [incorporeal](/Traits.aspx?ID=222) [undead](/Traits.aspx?ID=160), a spirit-singer grants you a +1 item bonus to [Performance](/Skills.aspx?ID=12) checks. While playing a spirit-singer, you also gain a +1 item bonus to checks to detect a haunt or incorporeal undead, and you can roll a check to notice a haunt even if you aren't actively [Searching](/Actions.aspx?ID=519) for it, due to the distortions of the spirit-singer's music. A haunt or incorporeal undead that is intelligent enough to notice the effects it is having on the spirit-singer's music and that can't otherwise communicate with the living might choose to use the spirit-singer to do so if it wishes. For instance, it could try to guide the spirit-singer player towards a location by creating distortions in that direction or, if it understands language, it could try to answer questions by creating one distortion for yes and two distortions for no. Unless stated otherwise in its usage entry, a spirit-singer functions like a heavy [musical instrument](/Equipment.aspx?ID=37); rather than carrying it, the musician places the spirit-singer in a particular position and uses both hands to play.\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n<title\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nright=\"Item 5\"\r\npfs=\"Standard\"\r\n>\r\nSpirit-Singer\r\n</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Guns &amp; Gears](/Sources.aspx?ID=98) pg. 83</row>\n\n**Price** 150 gp\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n**Bulk** 16\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n<title\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nright=\"Item 6\"\r\npfs=\"Standard\"\r\n>\r\nSpirit-Singer (Handheld)\r\n</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Guns &amp; Gears](/Sources.aspx?ID=98) pg. 83</row>\n\n**Price** 200 gp\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n**Usage** held in 2 hands\r\n\r\n**Bulk** 1\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n<title\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nright=\"Item 11\"\r\npfs=\"Standard\"\r\n>\r\nSpirit-Singer (Incredible)\r\n</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Guns &amp; Gears](/Sources.aspx?ID=98) pg. 83</row>\n\n**Price** 1,250 gp\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n**Bulk** 16\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis spirit-singer is fine-tuned to the point that you can analyze its song more intricately.
