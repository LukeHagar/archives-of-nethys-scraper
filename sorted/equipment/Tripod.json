They can be set up and attached to a firearm with a single Interact action using one hand, setting the tripod in your square. While this sturdy piece of engineering is in use, you don't take the –2 penalty for firing a kickback weapon, even if your Strength isn't high enough to avoid the penalty. However, you must retrieve the tripod with a single Interact action before you can move the firearm to a different position. Normally, when you're [hidden](/Conditions.aspx?ID=22) or [undetected](/Conditions.aspx?ID=39), you become observed if you do anything except Hide, [Sneak](/Actions.aspx?ID=63), or Step. However, deploying or retrieving a tripod with an Interact action doesn't automatically make you observed, so long as you don't set up or remove the tripod when it's in a spot where creatures can see the tripod itself.\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>",
