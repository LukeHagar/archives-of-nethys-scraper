They are designed to let you doff and throw the shield in one swift movement. You can quickly remove the shield by spending a free action as part of the Strike to throw the shield. When thrown in this way, the shield is a martial thrown weapon that deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage and has the [thrown 20 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=195) trait. A shield with the throwing shield attachment can't have any attached weapons, such as [shield spikes](/Weapons.aspx?ID=42) or a [shield boss](/Weapons.aspx?ID=41), and the adjustments to make it more aerodynamic make it slightly less sturdy, reducing its Hardness by 1.\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>",
