They belong to a larger set of lenses created to manipulate or even bind the Empty Death; most of the other lenses are long lost and likely destroyed. The Haruvex family came into possession of four of the lenses, and they knew that bringing them together focused Nhimbaloth's attention in unprecedented and dangerous ways. Belcorra brought all four lenses to the Abomination Vaults with her, intending to install them in Gauntlight for her ultimate revenge upon Absalom. She also created a special receptacle called the [_Fulcrum Lattice_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=943) to hold the lenses so that their power could be focused together. She realized the danger of keeping the _fulcrum lenses_ too close together until the right time and spread them out among loyal groups in the Abomination Vaults' lowest levels for safekeeping.\n\n Belcorra keeps only the most powerful lens, the _Ebon Fulcrum Lens_, with herâ€”indeed, as a ghost, it's the only one she can carry. If the heroes can bring the other three lenses to bear against Belcorra, they can draw Nhimbaloth's dread glare to the sorcerer. Despite her loyalty, Belcorra can't hope to keep her spirit intact when Nhimbaloth gazes directly upon it.\n\n The _fulcrum lenses_ are more than mere receptacles of Nhimbaloth's essence. Each grants those who use it a fragment of the Great Old One's power.\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n<title\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nright=\"Item 9\"\r\npfs=\"\"\r\n>\r\nCrimson Fulcrum Lens\r\n</title>\r\n\r\n<spoilers>May contain spoilers from Abomination Vaults</spoilers>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Unique\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=161\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Enchantment\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=61\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Invested\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=98\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Occult\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=120\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #165: Eyes of Empty Death](/Sources.aspx?ID=81) pg. 75</row>\n\n**Price** 700 gp\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n**Bulk** 1\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis concave lens has a drifting crimson cloud resembling slowly swirling blood within it.
