The repellent does not deter a cave worm from making ranged attacks against a coated target. If no creatures are within a cave worm's reach and it wants to approach and make a melee attack, it approaches and attacks a non-coated creature if it can without spending more actions to do so. \n\nIf the coated creature is swallowed by the designated type of cave worm, the cave worm must succeed at a Fortitude save or involuntarily regurgitate the swallowed creature on the next round (a single action).\n\n When sprinkled around an area, cave worm repellent negates any chance of a random encounter with the particular type of cave worm in that area, as the creatures purposefully avoid the affected area.\n\n Other types of repellent that function similarly to this one might exist at the GM's discretion. Uncommon or rare creatures are typically much harder to repel, and repellent against them might necessitate harvesting ingredients from the creatures themselves (such as the creature's liver or a certain gland).\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n<title\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nright=\"Item 13\"\r\npfs=\"\"\r\n>\r\nPurple Worm Repellent\r\n</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #155: Lord of the Black Sands](/Sources.aspx?ID=33) pg. 75</row>\n\n**Price** 550 gp\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n<title\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nright=\"Item 15\"\r\npfs=\"\"\r\n>\r\nAzure Worm Repellent\r\n</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #155: Lord of the Black Sands](/Sources.aspx?ID=33) pg. 75</row>\n\n**Price** 1,100 gp\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n</row>\n\n</column>\n\n**Craft Requirements** The initial raw ingredients must include an [azure worm](/Monsters.aspx?ID=74)'s scale.\r\n\r\n<title\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nright=\"Item 18\"\r\npfs=\"\"\r\n>\r\nCrimson Worm Repellent\r\n</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #155: Lord of the Black Sands](/Sources.aspx?ID=33) pg. 75</row>\n\n**Price** 4,500 gp\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n</row>\n\n</column>\n\n**Craft Requirements** The initial raw ingredients must include a [crimson worm](/Monsters.aspx?ID=75)'s liver.",
