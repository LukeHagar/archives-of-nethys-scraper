A _bleachguard doll_ has the alignment and demeanor of its creator, but new experiences can cause the two to diverge. The doll's creator is neither able to control it nor are they constantly aware of its activities.

Each bleachguard doll can cast the cantrips [_light_](/Spells.aspx?ID=171) (3rd level), [_prestidigitation_](/Spells.aspx?ID=229), and one other 3rd-level cantrip, along with one spell (at 3rd level) that can be cast once per day. The creator chooses the cantrip and spells, which can't require an attack roll or saving throw, during the doll's creation.\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-1950\" />\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-1951\" />\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>",
