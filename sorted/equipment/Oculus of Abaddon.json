When held, the oculus feels warm to the touch and fills you with a sudden desire to pluck out an eye and place the oculus within the socket—this causes 4d6 [persistent bleed damage](/Conditions.aspx?ID=29). Once placed in an eye socket, the oculus can be removed only by ripping it free (causing the same amount of persistent bleed damage as the initial plucking). When you place the oculus in your empty eye socket, you immediately heal all damage caused by plucking the previous eye out. Once placed, an oculus grants you constant [darkvision](/Rules.aspx?ID=415). It can also be activated to perform a number of other magical effects, as detailed below, but if you aren't evil, each time you activate an _oculus of Abaddon_, you must succeed at a DC 36 Will save or become affected by a [_subconscious suggestion_](/Spells.aspx?ID=314) (heightened to 8th level) to perform an evil act the next time an opportunity to do so arises, as determined by the GM.\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-1351\" />\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-1352\" />\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-1353\" />\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-1354\" />\r\n\r\n**Destruction** A foul and hideous object, an _oculus of Abaddon_ is fortunately relatively easy to destroy, as far as artifacts go.
