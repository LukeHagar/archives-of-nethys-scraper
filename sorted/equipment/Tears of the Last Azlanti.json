The backside of each bail is engraved with a single ancient [Azlanti](/Languages.aspx?ID=49) rune: Patience, Remembrance, Resilience, Tenacity, Wisdom, Invention.\n\n While a bail is active, you recall pieces of childhood memories, brief stories and lessons spoken to you by Aroden. The knowledge imparted by each bail carries a specific power but also allows you to access the invested and resonant powers of the _aeon stone_ in the active bail's slot as though the stone orbited your head. Each day at dawn, a new bail becomes active; roll 1d6 to determine which bail is active, determined by the table below. Only one bail can be active at any time. \n\nOnce per day, you can attempt to exchange the _aeon stone_ in a given bail for another _aeon stone_ with a successful DC 35 [Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2) check. \n\n##  \n<row gap=\"tiny\">\n<table> <tr><td>**D6**</td><td>**Bail**</td><td>**Default _Aeon Stone_**</td> </tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">1</td><td>Patience</td><td>Gold nodule</td></tr> <tr><td colspan=\"2\">**Active Power**: Telepathy with a range of 100 feet</td></tr> <tr><td rowspan=\"2\">2</td><td>Remembrance</td><td>Tourmaline sphere</td></tr> <tr><td colspan=\"2\">**Active Power**: Cast [_hypercognition_](/Spells.aspx?ID=156) at will</td></tr> <tr><td rowspan=\"2\">3</td><td>Resilience</td><td>Clear spindle</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">**Active Power**: Worn armor gains the [_antimagic_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=282) property rune</td></tr> <tr><td rowspan=\"2\">4</td><td>Tenacity</td><td>Pink rhomboid</td></tr> <tr><td colspan=\"2\">**Active Power**: Wielded weapons gain the [_vorpal_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=308) property rune</td></tr> <tr><td rowspan=\"2\">5</td><td>Wisdom</td><td>Orange prism</td></tr> <tr><td colspan=\"2\">**Active Power**: Skill checks for [downtime](/Traits.aspx?ID=49) activities or to [Recall Knowledge](/Actions.aspx?ID=26) are one degree of success higher</td></tr> <tr><td rowspan=\"2\">6</td><td>Invention</td><td>Lavender and green ellipsoid</td></tr> <tr><td colspan=\"2\">**Active Power**: You can craft items up to 5 levels higher than your actual level</td></tr></table></row>\r\n\r\n**Destruction** The memories and lessons that echo through the _Tears of the Last Azlanti_ give clues about steps needed to destroy the artifact.
