It's effective at weakening [water elementals](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=45), [air elementals](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=41), [ooze](/Traits.aspx?ID=122), and other creatures the GM determines are similarly amorphous, which can even include particularly gelatinous [aberrations](/Traits.aspx?ID=1). You release the dust toward one creature within 5 feet of you, which must attempt a Fortitude saving throw. The target must repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns.
