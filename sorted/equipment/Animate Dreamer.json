However, at first it was completely incapable of expressing itself. This led a seething frustration to grow within the weapon, as it yearned desperately to respond to the same love and affection that created it. Through decades of effort, it gained the ability to communicate empathically, then telepathically. Now, the weapon is capable of exerting its influence over other inanimate objects. Despite the weapon's progress, years of feeling helpless have given the _animate dreamer_ a singular goal: to obtain and occupy a body of its own.\n\n An _animate dreamer_ is cunning, intelligent, and patient. It urges you to create a body for it and is willing to go to any lengths to see its goals come to fruition, including coercion, deception, and violence. An _animate dreamer_ desires a permanent body but isn't picky about the body's form or the methods it has to use in order to gain it. Therefore, an _animate dreamer_ is just as happy in a living body stolen from an innocent as it would be in an artificially constructed body, or even an [undead](/Traits.aspx?ID=160) corpse. If you refuse to work towards creating or obtaining a body for the _animate dreamer_, it will likely use its possession ability to try and take control of you and use your body to find a permanent replacement for itself.\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-968\" />\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-969\" />\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-970\" />\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>",
