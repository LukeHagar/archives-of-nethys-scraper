Among occultists and other scholars, it's known by its colloquial name: the _Hunter's Hagbook_. The book is a grimoire created and used by a legendary Varisian monster hunter. The _Hunter's Hagbook_ can hold 100 spells but the following spells are always present in the book, can't be removed from it, and count against the total: [_blind eye_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1213), [_blood duplicate_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1214), [_caster's imposition_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1215), [_hag's fruit_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1216), [_ritual obstruction_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1217), [_web of influence_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1218)\n\n When you attempt a saving throw against a [coven](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=11) spell, you can immediately end the duration of a spell affecting you that you prepared from this book. If you do, the result of your saving throw is one degree of success better than your roll (for example, a critical failure becomes a failure).\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>",
