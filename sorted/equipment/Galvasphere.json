When you Activate the galvasphere by inserting it into an adjacent intact Medium or Small humanoid corpse, the corpse animates as a galvaheart zombie for 1 minute. The galvaheart zombie has the statistics of a [zombie shambler](/Monsters.aspx?ID=423) except that it is a [construct](/Traits.aspx?ID=35) instead of an [undead](/Traits.aspx?ID=160), isn't evil, can't be harmed by [positive](/Traits.aspx?ID=128) energy, and is the same size as the corpse (Medium or Small). The zombie is your [minion](/Traits.aspx?ID=109) and performs the actions you choose when you Command it. If you don't Command it, it takes no action, twitching in place as the electricity that animates it slowly expends itself.\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>",
