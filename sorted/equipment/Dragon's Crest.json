A dragon's crest can be etched with weapon runes, much like a [shield boss](/Weapons.aspx?ID=41) or [shield spikes](/Weapons.aspx?ID=42), but doesn't otherwise alter your shield's statistics. A shield bearing a dragon's crest can't be combined with an [attached](/Traits.aspx?ID=171) weapon, like shield spikes.\n\n You can use an Interact action to wedge an [alchemical bomb](/equipment/alchemical-items/alchemical-bombs) into the crest's jaws. While a bomb is wedged in the shield, you take a –1 penalty to attack rolls with the shield. When you successfully Strike a creature with the shield, the vessel shatters, exposing the creature you hit—and yourself— to the substance within. This counts as a successful hit with the bomb against the creature if it's adjacent to you or a successful hit against the appropriate adjacent square if it's not. The bomb deals [splash](/Traits.aspx?ID=150) damage as normal to surrounding creatures, including you. In addition, the bomb deals full damage to the attached shield.\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>",
