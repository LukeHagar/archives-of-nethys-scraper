When you fire an activated _stepping stone shot_, whether you hit or miss your target, the shot creates a series of supports in a line that creatures can walk on as if solid ground. The line can ascend or descend at a 45-degree angle. The discs support any amount of weight, but don't otherwise pose any sort of obstacle; creatures and attacks can move through them if they wish. They crumble to dust if anything attempts to move or otherwise manipulate them. A creature can use a two-action activity, which has the [manipulate](/Traits.aspx?ID=104) trait, to Stride up to its speed on the stones while causing them to crumble behind it. This ammunition does not work in firearms with the [scatter](/Traits.aspx?ID=413) trait. The maximum length of the line depends on the type of ammunition. However, the line also can't extend beyond the maximum distance for a Strike from your firearm (usually six times the firearm's range increment).\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n<title\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nright=\"Item 7\"\r\npfs=\"Standard\"\r\n>\r\nStepping Stone Shot\r\n</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Guns &amp; Gears](/Sources.aspx?ID=98) pg. 171</row>\n\n**Price** 65 gp\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe stones reach up to 100 feet, and they last up to the end of your next turn if no one collapses them.\r\n\r\n<title\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nright=\"Item 10\"\r\npfs=\"Standard\"\r\n>\r\nStepping Stone Shot (Greater)\r\n</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Guns &amp; Gears](/Sources.aspx?ID=98) pg. 171</row>\n\n**Price** 185 gp\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe stones reach up to 250 feet, and they last up to 1 minute if no one collapses them.",
