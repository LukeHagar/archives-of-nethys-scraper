Placing the glove on your hand causes excruciating pain as your appendage curls into a tight fist and then slowly transforms to a supernaturally hard ball of black stone, fusing to you and preventing you from using this hand for anything other than gauntlet Strikes or the _grasp of Droskar's_ activated abilities (a _grasp of Droskar_ does not have the [free-hand](/Traits.aspx?ID=181) weapon trait). The gauntlet can't be removed without a successful casting of [_remove curse_](/Spells.aspx?ID=250) or a similar spell. The gauntlet reverts to normal (and can be removed with ease) if the curse is removed, the hand is removed from the body, or the wearer dies.\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-1319\" />\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-1320\" />\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>",
