She is an intelligent _+4 major striking [holy](/Equipment.aspx?ID=299) [bastard sword](/Weapons.aspx?ID=15)_. Although the sword is made of steel, Serithtial is also treated as [cold iron](/Equipment.aspx?ID=375) and [silver](/Equipment.aspx?ID=379), allowing her to deal more damage to certain supernatural creatures. She glows as bright as a torch, but you or _Serithtial_ can suppress or resume this glow as a single action, which has the [concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=36) trait. In addition, Strikes with _Serithtial_ deal an additional 2d6 damage against creatures that are worshippers of [Zon-Kuthon](/Deities.aspx?ID=20), and while wielding _Serithtial_, you constantly benefit from [_death ward_](/Spells.aspx?ID=64) and [_freedom of movement_](/Spells.aspx?ID=128) spells that function only against effects created by followers of Zon-Kuthon.\n\n Serithtial was forged as a [bastard sword](/Weapons.aspx?ID=15), and she reverts to this shape when no one wields her, but she can also detect what sort of blade her current wielder prefers and transform into it (choosing from [dagger](/Weapons.aspx?ID=3), [shortsword](/Weapons.aspx?ID=43), [longsword](/Weapons.aspx?ID=31), [scimitar](/Weapons.aspx?ID=38), [falchion](/Weapons.aspx?ID=18), [greatsword](/Weapons.aspx?ID=24), [rapier](/Weapons.aspx?ID=36), or bastard sword) using an action, which she does when first held. The wielder can empathically tell _Serithtial_ to transform at any time by using a single action, which has the concentrate trait, after which _Serithtial_ uses an action to transform.\n\n _Serithtial_ is willing to work with a partner of almost any alignment as long as they are dedicated to defeating the great wyrm Kazavon and the forces of Zon-Kuthon. If you ignore those threats and pursue your own agenda instead, before long _Serithtial_ attempts to seize control of your body (DC 45 Will save to resist her control), though she typically remains in control for only long enough to find a more worthy partner. You can attempt a new Will save each day to retake control of your body.\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-405\" />\r\n\r\n**Destruction** If Kazavon or a great wyrm shadow dragon who is a worshipper of Zon-Kuthon uses its breath weapon on _Serithtial_ while she is unattended, the sword melts into a pool of mundane iron.\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>",
