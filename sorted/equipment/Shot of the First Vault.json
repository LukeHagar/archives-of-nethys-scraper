Since then, individual pieces have turned up throughout the multiverse. When you pick up a _shot of the First Vault_, it immediately reshapes itself to function with any ranged weapon and establishes you as its owner until another creature picks it up.

Upon damaging a creature, the _shot of the First Vault_ shatters, and the fragments ricochet to hit any other enemies within 30 feet, making attack rolls with the same attack bonus. The shattered fragments remain lodged in the creatures they damage; the creatures are [clumsy 2](/Conditions.aspx?ID=3) while the fragments remain in place. A total of 3 actions, which have the [manipulate](/Traits.aspx?ID=104) trait, are required to remove the fragments from yourself or an adjacent creature; alternatively, a single action and a successful DC 30 [Medicine](/Skills.aspx?ID=9) check can be used.
