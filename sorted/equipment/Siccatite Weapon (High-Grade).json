Siccatite weapons have substantial grip wrappings to protect their wielders from the metal's extreme temperatures. They're constantly surrounded by a heat haze or a halo of rime, depending on the siccatite's type. Siccatite weapons automatically gain either a [flaming](/Equipment.aspx?ID=295) or [frost](/Equipment.aspx?ID=296) property rune, for hot and cold siccatite respectively, even if they aren't otherwise enchanted; this rune can't be removed, and it deals 1d8 damage instead of 1d6 damage. This uses one of the weapon's property rune slots as normal. High-grade siccatite gains a _greater flaming_ (hot siccatite) or _greater frost_ (cold siccatite) property instead.\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n<title\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nright=\"Item 11\"\r\npfs=\"Standard\"\r\n>\r\nSiccatite Weapon (Standard-Grade)\r\n</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Grand Bazaar](/Sources.aspx?ID=100) pg. 101</row>\n\n**Price** 1,400 gp (+140 gp per Bulk)\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n</row>\n\n</column>\n\n**Craft Requirements** at least 175 gp of siccatite + 17.5 gp per Bulk\r\n\r\n<title\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nright=\"Item 17\"\r\npfs=\"Standard\"\r\n>\r\nSiccatite Weapon (High-Grade)\r\n</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Grand Bazaar](/Sources.aspx?ID=100) pg. 101</row>\n\n**Price** 15,000 gp (+1,500 gp per Bulk)\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n</row>\n\n</column>\n\n**Craft Requirements** at least 7,500 gp of siccatite + 750 gp per Bulk",
