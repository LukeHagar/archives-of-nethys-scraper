The reverse is also true, that general access to firearms does not grant access to ancestry-specific weapons. If you have access to firearms, you can gain access to firearms with an ancestry trait (dwarf, elf, goblin, etc.) by selecting an ancestry feat or other option that specifically grants it (for example, to gain access to a clan pistol, take the Clan Pistol feat or Dwarven Weapon Familiarity feat)._\n\n**Access**  The following regions have access to firearms: Alkenstar, Dongun Hold, Tian Xia, Vudra, Arcadia, Ustalav, the Shackles\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Price** 5 gp\r\n\r\n**Damage** 1d6 P\r\n\r\n**Bulk** L\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Hands** 1\r\n\r\n**Range** 80 ft.\r\n\r\n**Reload** 1\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Category** Martial\r\n\r\n**Group** [Firearm](/WeaponGroups.aspx?ID=16)\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Ammunition** [Firearm Ammunition (10 rounds)](/Weapons.aspx?ID=211)\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe tradition of [dwarves](/Ancestries.aspx?ID=1) displaying their clan affiliations with special [clan daggers](/Weapons.aspx?ID=13) goes back millennia, but many of the dwarf clans of Dongun Hold have their own take on the tradition, with promising young gunsmiths claiming their adulthood by crafting a specialized personal firearm using the clan's unique smithing traditions.
