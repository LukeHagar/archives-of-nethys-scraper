You can wield it in two hands (using the two-hand damage) or by spinning it around an arm. While you spin the hoop, it gains the [free-hand](/Traits.aspx?ID=181) trait. Setting the hoop spinning takes 1 Interact action. In addition to the normal restrictions of the free-hand trait, extended use of the arm for locomotion (such as to [Climb](/Actions.aspx?ID=33)) interferes with the hoop’s spinning and forces you to Release the hoop. You can’t spin a hoop underwater. Keeping the hoop spinning requires a free action each round, which has the concentrate and manipulate traits. You can keep a hoop spinning as an exploration activity, but doing so for more than 10 minutes makes you fatigued, similarly to [Hustling](/Actions.aspx?ID=515).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Critical Specialization Effects</title>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Core Rulebook](/Sources.aspx?ID=1) pg. 283 <sup>4.0</sup></row>\r\n\r\nCertain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success.
