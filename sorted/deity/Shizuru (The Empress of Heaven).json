She is revered as the ruler of the Tian pantheon, respected as the finest samurai in Heaven or Golarion, and honored as the patron of nature and emperors alike. Perhaps the most famous tale about her is that of Shizuru and her lover [Tsukiyo](/Deities.aspx?ID=48), the moon god. After Tsukiyo was slain by his brother [Fumeiyoshi](/Deities.aspx?ID=175) in a fit of jealousy, Shizuru brought the moon god back to life with the aid of [Qi Zhong](/Deities.aspx?ID=182), the god of medicine. Sadly, Tsukiyo was deeply affected by his experience with death, and though he and Shizuru still love each other, the event created a rift between them.
