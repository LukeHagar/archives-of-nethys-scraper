Eschewing crusades and other ventures that take his followers away from their homes, Erastil watches over those who devote their lives to family and community.

His domain encompasses the plants and animals that farmers, hunters, and ranchers deal with in their everyday lives. While he is a protective deity, Erastil steps in only when quiet, pastoral lives are threatened.
