When a great king trips on his robe after berating a servant or a high priest's sleeve catches fire to interfere with a sacrifice, worshippers of these trickster gods see the hand of the divine. Court entertainers and bards naturally gravitate toward this faith, as many nations provide protections for them to speak their mind to rulers, however powerful. Worshippers of the Perplexing Jest can also be found far from court, wherever practical jokers undermine cocky bullies, or laborers use malicious compliance and clever sabotage to stymie corrupt business owners. Anywhere pompous enforcers of tradition cause society to stagnate, the Perplexing Jest invites the creative to laugh.\n\n Firebrands who dedicate themselves to the Perplexing Jest and to combating injustice believe that if tyrants and autocrats are laughed off their thrones, so much the better. With a little divine assistance, a lone actor can infuriate a powerful leader—even one they'd never have the power to challenge openly—with well-timed practical jokes and embarrassing pranks.
