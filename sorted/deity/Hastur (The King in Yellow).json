He works toward this feat through his avatar, the King in Yellow, which can manifest anywhere in the universe the light from Carcosa’s sun can be seen. The King in Yellow appears as a humanoid figure draped in yellow clothing, but there is nothing within the clothes save a shapeless, horrifying presence.
