Once per day, after attempting a check, you can roll a second time. You must use the result of the second roll, even if it is worse. This is a fortune effect.

Once, when you roll a natural 20 on a die, the result becomes a natural 1 instead.

Any time you are presented with a wager, you are compelled to accept, no matter the odds.
