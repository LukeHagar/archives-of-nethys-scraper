Groetus was listed as a member of the pantheon in a different source, but is not treated as a current member of the pantheon in the Pathfinder Society campaign._\r\n\r\nA pantheon rapidly gaining popularity throughout the Inner Sea is the Cosmic Caravan. Astronomers and astrologers will tell you the Cosmic Caravan is a collection of constellations visible in the night sky, said to travel forever in a circle around the star Cynosure. The association of a diverse array of deities and demigods linked to the stars—and the spaces between them—first rose to prominence in western Avistan, particularly in Varisia, Nidal, and Ravounel. The deities worshipped by the faithful are a heady and diverse group that shows the true depth of understanding of this pantheon: [Desna](/Deities.aspx?ID=5) and [Sarenrae](/Deities.aspx?ID=16); the empyreal lords [Ashava](/Deities.aspx?ID=114), [Black Butterfly](/Deities.aspx?ID=115), and [Pulura](/Deities.aspx?ID=125); the elven god [Ketephys](/Deities.aspx?ID=110); and the outer god [Yog-Sothoth](/Deities.aspx?ID=166). Their religious observances take place at night and center around stargazing. While [Groetus](/Deities.aspx?ID=38) served as the moon in the original pantheon, the god's treatment of spreading hope as anathema has caused many to swap in the Tian deity [Tsukiyo](/Deities.aspx?ID=48) in regions where he's known.\n\n If your travels take you through Nidal, you'll find this pantheon has been gaining ground there against the worship of [Zon-Kuthon](/Deities.aspx?ID=20), whose faithful feel they own the worship of the night. A rising number of Cosmic Caravan worshippers in that nation seek to oppose or, one day, even overthrow the Midnight Lord's theocracy to reclaim the night from the implications that all who dwell in the dark are evil.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Category** [Pantheons\r\n](/DeityCategories.aspx?ID=18)\r\n\r\n**Edicts** spend time stargazing or meditating in moonlight, aid those who live in regions where Zon-Kuthon (or other religions that espouse the night as a bastion for evil) hold sway, help the desperate or forlorn to see potential for a better life in the future, travel with no particular destination in mind\r\n\r\n**Anathema** portray the night as a time of evil, destroy astronomical or astrological equipment, spend the night in the same place twice in a row\r\n\r\n**Area of Concern**\r\nconstellations, fortune telling, the night, hope for a better tomorrow\r\n\r\n**Follower Alignments**\r\nCG, CN, NG\r\n\r\n**Pantheon Members**\r\n[Ashava](/Deities.aspx?ID=114), [Black Butterfly](/Deities.aspx?ID=115), [Desna](/Deities.aspx?ID=5), [Ketephys](/Deities.aspx?ID=110), [Pulura](/Deities.aspx?ID=125), [Sarenrae](/Deities.aspx?ID=16), [Tsukiyo](/Deities.aspx?ID=48), [Yog-Sothoth](/Deities.aspx?ID=166)\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n<title level=\"2\">Devotee Benefits</title>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**[Divine Ability](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=132)**\r\nDexterity or Charisma\r\n\r\n**Divine Font** [Harm](/Spells.aspx?ID=146) or [Heal](/Spells.aspx?ID=148)\r\n\r\n**Divine Skill** [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11)\r\n\r\n**Favored Weapon** [Starknife](/Weapons.aspx?ID=44)\r\n\r\n**Domains** [Darkness](/Domains.aspx?ID=6), [Fate](/Domains.aspx?ID=12), [Freedom](/Domains.aspx?ID=14), [Moon](/Domains.aspx?ID=21)\r\n\r\n**[Alternate Domains](/Rules.aspx?ID=802)** [Star](/Domains.aspx?ID=52), [Void](/Domains.aspx?ID=56)\r\n\r\n**Cleric Spells**\n\n- **1st**\r\n[Object Reading](/Spells.aspx?ID=705)\n\n- **2nd**\r\n[Glitterdust](/Spells.aspx?ID=136)\n\n- **6th**\r\n[Blanket of Stars](/Spells.aspx?ID=671)\n\n</column>",
