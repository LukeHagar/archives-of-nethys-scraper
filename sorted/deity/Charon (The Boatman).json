Holding knowledge from the earliest days of existence, he alone knows Abaddon’s true history, but he keeps it to himself. This allows him to exploit opportunities with curious mortals, sweeping more souls into his dread kingdom.\n\n Charon appears as a tall, looming man dressed in a frayed cloak and gripping a lantern staff firmly in one hand, but it is widely believed that this form is a facade.
