The flashier deities in this pantheon are the better known, for who doesn't associate [Besmara](/Deities.aspx?ID=32), the Pirate Queen, with her swashbuckling antics and [Hei Feng](/Deities.aspx?ID=40), the Duke of Thunder, with the storms survivors still speak of years later? Yet the duality of [Gozreh](/Deities.aspx?ID=8) and the sustainability and care of [Ylimancha](/Deities.aspx?ID=132) round out this pantheon. The Wind and the Waves and the Harborwing strive for safety and balance between air, land, and sea, and it's for their care that many a frightened, storm- tossed seafarer prays during a perilous journey. Followers of this pantheon aren't given to regular worship unless to utter a simple prayer or recitation on the bow of a ship at sea. Instead, the faithful find themselves most pious when the winds, waves, and thunder are in full force, threatening the survival of the ship, or when they pull into harbor after safely enduring a storm. At such times, joyous celebrations of dancing, singing, and pouring out libations to their gods mark their worship.
