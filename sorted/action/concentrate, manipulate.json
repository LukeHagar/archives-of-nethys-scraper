In creature form, the giant rat acts on your turn. It gets 2 actions and can't use reactions. You have to spend an action each turn to tell it what to do; otherwise, it tries to run away from danger or cowers where it is. If the rat is slain while in animal form, it reverts to its statue shape and can't be transformed again until 1 week has passed. If the figurine is destroyed while in its statue form, it's shattered and its magical properties are lost forever.",
