The GM assigns a task level representing the most lucrative job available. You can search for lower-level tasks, with the GM determining whether you find any. Sometimes you can attempt to find better work than the initial offerings, though this takes time and requires using the Diplomacy skill to Gather Information, doing some research, or socializing.\n\n When you take on a job, the GM secretly sets the DC of your skill check. After your first day of work, you roll to determine your earnings. You gain an amount of income based on your result, the task’s level, and your proficiency rank (as listed on Table 4–2: Income Earned).\n\n You can continue working at the task on subsequent days without needing to roll again. For each day you spend after the first, you earn the same amount as the first day, up until the task’s completion. The GM determines how long you can work at the task. Most tasks last a week or two, though some can take months or even years.\n\n## Table 4-2: Income Earned\n<row gap=\"tiny\">\n<table> <tr><td>**Task Level**</td><td>**DC**</td><td>**Failed**</td><td>**Trained**</td><td>**Expert**</td><td>**Master**</td><td>**Legendary**</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>14</td><td>1 cp</td><td>5 cp</td><td>5 cp</td><td>5 cp</td><td>5 cp</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>15</td><td>2 cp</td><td>2 sp</td><td>2 sp</td><td>2 sp</td><td>2 sp</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>16</td><td>4 cp</td><td>3 sp</td><td>3 sp</td><td>3 sp</td><td>3 sp</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>18</td><td>8 cp</td><td>5 sp</td><td>5 sp</td><td>5 sp</td><td>5 sp</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>19</td><td>1 sp</td><td>7 sp</td><td>8 sp</td><td>8 sp</td><td>8 sp</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>20</td><td>2 sp</td><td>9 sp</td><td>1 gp</td><td>1 gp</td><td>1 gp</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>22</td><td>3 sp</td><td>1 gp, 5 sp</td><td>2 gp</td><td>2 gp</td><td>2 gp</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>23</td><td>4 sp</td><td>2 gp</td><td>2 gp, 5 sp</td><td>2 gp, 5 sp</td><td>2 gp, 5 sp</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>24</td><td>5 sp</td><td>2 gp, 5 sp</td><td>3 gp</td><td>3 gp</td><td>3 gp</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>26</td><td>6 sp</td><td>3 gp</td><td>4 gp</td><td>4 gp</td><td>4 gp</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>27</td><td>7 sp</td><td>4 gp</td><td>5 gp</td><td>6 gp</td><td>6 gp</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>28</td><td>8 sp</td><td>5 gp</td><td>6 gp</td><td>8 gp</td><td>8 gp</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>30</td><td>9 sp</td><td>6 gp</td><td>8 gp</td><td>10 gp</td><td>10 gp</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>31</td><td>1 gp</td><td>7 gp</td><td>10 gp</td><td>15 gp</td><td>15 gp</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>32</td><td>1 gp, 5 sp</td><td>8 gp</td><td>15 gp</td><td>20 gp</td><td>20 gp</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>34</td><td>2 gp</td><td>10 gp</td><td>20 gp</td><td>28 gp</td><td>28 gp</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>35</td><td>2 gp, 5 sp</td><td>13 gp</td><td>25 gp</td><td>36 gp</td><td>40 gp</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>36</td><td>3 gp</td><td>15 gp</td><td>30 gp</td><td>45 gp</td><td>55 gp</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>38</td><td>4 gp</td><td>20 gp</td><td>45 gp</td><td>70 gp</td><td>90 gp</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>39</td><td>6 gp</td><td>30 gp</td><td>60 gp</td><td>100 gp</td><td>130 gp</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>40</td><td>8 gp</td><td>40 gp</td><td>75 gp</td><td>150 gp</td><td>200 gp</td></tr><tr><td>20 (critical success)</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>50 gp</td><td>90 gp</td><td>175 gp</td><td>300 gp</td></tr> </table></row>\r\n\r\n**Critical Success** You do outstanding work.
