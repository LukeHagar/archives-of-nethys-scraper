In this form you aren't incorporeal, but you also don't have a solid form and don't occupy your space, allowing other creatures to pass through or end their turn there. You gain resistance 20 to all damage except [force](/Traits.aspx?ID=75) damage, damage from effects with the [light](/Traits.aspx?ID=100) trait, and damage from Strikes with the [ghost touch](/Equipment.aspx?ID=297) property rune. This increases to resistance 40 against nonmagical damage. Other creatures can't attempt Strength-based skill checks against you. Your land and climb Speeds both become 40 feet. You can't use actions except [Climb](/Actions.aspx?ID=33), Step, or Stride actions using the granted Speeds or an Interact activation to return to your normal form. If your current space doesn't have sufficient room for you to return to your normal form, you return to your normal form in the nearest open space.",
