Count roadless hexes that contain swamps or mountains, or each hex where you must cross a river or lake without the aid of a bridge, as two hexes.. You can issue orders to force march.

When you do so, choose any location within 30 hexes of the army's current hex, then roll your check. If the army's deployment causes it to cross your kingdom's border, the DC increases by 5.
