An animal is an independent creature with limited intelligence. Most animals understand only the simplest instructions, so you might be able to instruct your animal to move to a certain square but not dictate a specific path to get there, or command it to attack a certain creature but not to make its attack nonlethal. The GM decides the specifics of the action your animal uses.\n\n The animal does what you commanded as soon as it can, usually as its first action on its next turn. If you successfully commanded it multiple times, it does what you said in order. It forgets all commands beyond what it can accomplish on its turn. If multiple people command the same animal, the GM determines how the animal reacts. The GM might also make the DC higher if someone has already tried to Command the Animal that round.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Item Bonuses for Nature</title>\n<table>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>Item</th>\r\n<th>Bonus</th>\r\n<th>Level</th>\r\n<th>Category</th>\r\n<th>Consumable</th>\r\n<th>Note</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>[Ursine Avenger Hood](/Equipment.aspx?ID=2368)</td>\r\n<td>+1</td>\r\n<td>2</td>\r\n<td>[Artifacts](/equipment/artifacts)</td>\r\n<td>No</td>\r\n<td>Nature checks to Command an Animal</td>\r\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\r\n<td>[Broken Tusk Pendant](/Equipment.aspx?ID=1508)</td>\r\n<td>+1</td>\r\n<td>3</td>\r\n<td>[Other Worn Items](/equipment/worn-items/other-worn-items)</td>\r\n<td>No</td>\r\n<td>+1 item bonus to Nature checks;
