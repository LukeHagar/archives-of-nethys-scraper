These are only a brief summary of a creature's disposition. The GM will supply additional nuance based on the history and beliefs of the characters you're interacting with, and their attitudes can change in accordance with the story. The attitudes are detailed on the [Conditions](/conditions) page and are summarized here. \n<ul><li>[Helpful](/Conditions.aspx?ID=21): Willing to help you and responds favorably to your requests. </li><li>[Friendly](/Conditions.aspx?ID=18): Has a good attitude toward you, but won't necessarily stick their neck out to help you. </li><li>[Indifferent](/Conditions.aspx?ID=25): Doesn't care about you either way. (Most NPCs start out indifferent.) </li><li>[Unfriendly](/Conditions.aspx?ID=40): Dislikes you and doesn't want to help you. </li><li>[Hostile](/Conditions.aspx?ID=23): Actively works against you—and might attack you just because of their dislike.</li></ul> No one can ever change the attitude of a player character with these skills. You can roleplay interactions with player characters, and even use Diplomacy results if the player wants a mechanical sense of how convincing or charming a character is, but players make the ultimate decisions about how their characters respond.\n\n<title level=\"2\">Item Bonuses for
