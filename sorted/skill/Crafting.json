Even if you're untrained, you can Recall Knowledge.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Crafting Untrained General Actions</title>\r\n\r\n- [Recall Knowledge](/Skills.aspx?ID=5&amp;General=true) about alchemical reactions, the value of items, engineering, unusual materials, and alchemical or mechanical creatures. The GM determines which creatures this applies to, but it usually includes constructs.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Crafting Trained General Actions</title>\r\n\r\n- [Earn Income](/Skills.aspx?ID=2&amp;General=true) by crafting goods for the market.\n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Consumables and Ammunition</title> You can [Craft](/Actions.aspx?ID=43) items with the [consumable](/Traits.aspx?ID=36) trait in batches, making up to four of the same item at once with a single check. This requires you to include the raw materials for all the items in the batch at the start, and you must complete the batch all at once. You also Craft non-magical ammunition in batches, using the quantity listed in the [Ranged Weapons table](/equipment/weapons) (typically 10). \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Getting Formulas</title> You can gain access to the formulas for all common items in Chapter 6: Equipment by purchasing a [basic crafter's book](/Equipment.aspx?ID=6) (page 287). See [Formulas](/Rules.aspx?ID=250) for information on how to acquire other formulas.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Crafting Example</title> Ezren is a 5th-level wizard and an expert in Crafting. He has a Crafting modifier of +13 and the [Magical Crafting](/Feats.aspx?ID=812) feat. With 2 weeks of downtime ahead of him, he decides to craft a [_striking rune_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=280), a 4th-level item. The GM secretly chooses a DC of 19.\n\n The item has a Price of 65 gp, so Ezren prepares 32 gp, 5 sp worth of raw materials. He has another 32 gp, 5 sp worth of raw materials on hand. After spending 4 days building and incanting spells, he rolls a 12 on his Crafting check, for a result of 25. That’s a success! At this point, Ezren can spend the additional 32 gp, 5 sp worth of materials to complete the item immediately for 65 gp. However, Ezren has 10 more days on his hands, so he decides to spend additional time to complete the item. Because he’s a 5th-level character and an expert at Crafting, he reduces the amount he has to pay by 1 gp for each day spent. After spending 10 days working, he reduces the cost to complete the item from 65 gp to 55 gp. He spends the remaining portion of its Price in materials, completes the _striking rune_, and goes out on his next adventure. (He could have stayed home to keep working on the _striking rune_, eventually reducing the item’s total Price to just the half he paid up front, but adventuring is far more lucrative!)\n\n If Ezren’s Crafting check result were a 29 or higher, he’d have gotten a critical success. In that case, he’d reduce the remaining amount by 2 gp per day, lowering the amount needed to complete the item after 10 additional days of work to 45 gp.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Item Bonuses for
