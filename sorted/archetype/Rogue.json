With time and luck, you’ll become capable of moving through the shadows, striking unseen, and escaping without notice. Multiclass Rogue characters Nearly any character can benefit from the many skills and tricks the rogue archetype grants. Alchemist rogues can use the rogue’s Poison Weapon to great effect with their daily poisons, and sneak attack is a nice boost to bomb damage. Barbarian rogues can become masters in every save and diversify their skills. Champion rogues add damage from sneak attack while protecting their flanking partners from harm. Fighter rogues combine the fighter’s accuracy with extra damage, a deadly combination for archers or finesse fighters. Monk rogues have great synergy, since many stances grant powerful Strikes that work with sneak attack. Ranger rogues benefit from the shared focus on trailing foes and catching them flat-footed. The flurry edge can get you many sneak attacks, and the precision edge doubles down on precision damage. Spellcaster rogues use the rogue multiclass to shore up skills or to pick up tricky rogue feats like Mobility to help keep them safe. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-728\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-729\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-730\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-731\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-732\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-733\" />",
