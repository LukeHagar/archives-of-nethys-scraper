The [_Ursine Avenger Hood_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=2368) is such an item. After defeating a powerful [cave bear](/Monsters.aspx?ID=48), the Ulfen hunter Baruk shaped the bear's head and fur into a helm and cape for himself. Baruk later fell in battle against a [linnorm](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=69), successfully slaying the beast before succumbing to its death curse. His helm, soaked in the blood of man and linnorm and saturated with the magic of the linnorm's curse, was claimed by Baruk's daughter, who often told stories about the helm giving her a bear's strength and ferocity, though it was unclear at the time whether this was a boast.\n\n Over many generations, the magic of the hood was proven true, and more than that, the magic continued to grow and evolve with ever-more-ursine attributes. As the belief and power of each new wearer soaked into the hood, the artifact's potential has continued to grow. Now, those who bond with the generational artifact will discover that the _Ursine Avenger Hood_ continues to grow in power alongside them.\n\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-4086\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-4087\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-4088\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-4089\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-4090\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-4091\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-4092\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-4093\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-4094\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-4095\"\n\n/>",
