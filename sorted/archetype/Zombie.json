Although most zombies are mindless brutes, you're a [husk zombie](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1919), preserved through necromantic rites and alchemical reagents. The process worked especially well on you, and you retained your intelligence and identity to a far greater degree than other husk zombies.\n\n It's not easy being a corpse. Your body continues to rot and putrefy, and the stench is ever present. Your old self keeps slipping away, more and more as the weeks pass by. Your reflexes have slowed, you're beginning to lose your sense of touch, and your emotions are dulling. As your body continues to decay, so too, does your mind. Your memory's not perfect, and although you haven't noticed any huge gaps or flaws yet, you have a feeling they're there somewhere.\n\n Unlike your other senses, your hunger has intensified. You ceaselessly crave the raw flesh and brains of the living—the smarter the better—and satisfying this hunger is the only thing that makes you feel alive. When you eat, you're reinvigorated; feeling returns and the constant mental torpor you live under vanishes. You feel like yourself again... for a time.\n\n One day you might be nothing more than a walking corpse, but for now, you retain your personality and your free will. Feeding your hunger might allow you to remain that way.\n\n<title level=\"3\">Additional Feats</title>\r\n\r\nThis archetype has some feats at a level other than their original level.\r\nSuch feats are marked with a \\*.\r\n\r\n[Click here for the full rules on Additional Feats](/Rules.aspx?ID=1432).\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3557\" />\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3558\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-1604\"\r\noverride-title-right=\"Feat 4*\"\r\n\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-366\"\r\noverride-title-right=\"Feat 4*\"\r\n\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-439\"\r\noverride-title-right=\"Feat 4*\"\r\n\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3559\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3560\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3561\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3562\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3563\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3564\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3565\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3566\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3512\"\r\noverride-title-right=\"Feat 14*\"\r\n\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3567\"\n\n/>",
