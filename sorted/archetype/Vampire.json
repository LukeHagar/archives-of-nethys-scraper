A creature must Interact to brandish garlic or a religious symbol for 1 round (similar to [Raising a Shield](/Actions.aspx?ID=98)). If you involuntarily come within 10 feet of an object of your revulsion, you gain the [fleeing](/Conditions.aspx?ID=17) condition, running from the subject of your revulsion until you end an action beyond 10 feet of it. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of your revulsion, you can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the [concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32) trait. On a success, you overcome your revulsions for 1d6 rounds, or 1 hour on a critical success.\n\n **Sunlight**: If exposed to direct sunlight, you immediately become [slowed 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=35).
