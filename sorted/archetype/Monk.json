Multiclass Monk characters The monk archetype is a strong choice for any character that fights unarmored or with unarmed attacks. Barbarian monks with the animal instinct can combine the barbarian’s excellent unarmed damage with the monk’s diverse unarmed special abilities. Champion monks are perfect for champions of Irori or other deities who favor unarmed attacks. Fighter monks can supplement free-fighting and add mobility to the fighter’s toolkit. Rogue monks are incredibly effective because stances grant some of the best agile finesse attacks and flurry gives more sneak attacks. Spellcaster monks can fight with a free hand and still use material components to cast spells. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-716\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-717\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-718\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-719\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-720\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-721\" />",
