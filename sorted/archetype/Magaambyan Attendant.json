Not all Magaambyan attendants necessarily have this archetype, and this archetype doesn’t represent the abilities of all attendants; rather, the archetype represents many of those who have affiliated with a branch and are pursuing conversant rank.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Halcyon Spells</title>\r\n\r\nThrough hard study, Magaambyans can meld arcane and primal spellcasting. Halcyon spells are spells from the [arcane](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=1) or [primal](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=4) spell list. You don’t gain new halcyon spells via the normal means you typically use to gain spells; instead, you gain new halcyon spells and new spell levels of halcyon spells only through feats. Halcyon spells are prepared or cast just like other spells granted by your class; for example, a [wizard](/Classes.aspx?ID=12) who gained halcyon spells would add them to their spell list and their spellbook, while a [sorcerer](/Classes.aspx?ID=11) would add them to their spell list and their spell repertoire. If you have more than one arcane or primal spellcasting class, you add halcyon spells to all such classes.\n\n Each time you cast a halcyon spell, decide whether it is an arcane or primal spell. You can’t heighten a halcyon spell beyond your maximum spell level of halcyon spell, even if you have higher-level spell slots, and you can’t select a halcyon spell as a signature spell.\n\n Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, and each time you gain a halcyon feat, you can swap out one of your old halcyon spells for a different halcyon spell of the same level; this is in addition to any swapping from your class, such as via a sorcerer’s spell repertoire class feature. You can also swap out halcyon spells by retraining during downtime. If you have a spellbook, when you swap out a halcyon spell, you lose the spell from your spellbook entirely.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Magaambyan Archetypes</title>\r\n\r\nThese archetypes are uncommon, but characters who are Magaambyans of at least attendant rank have access to them.

Magaambyan Archetypes These archetypes are uncommon, but characters who are Magaambyans of at least attendant rank have access to them. PCs who start off a campaign as members of the Magaambya typically begin at attendant rank and thus have access to these archetypes. The Five Branches of Scholarship Magaambyan scholars believe in many fundamental values of scholarship. Key among them are adaptability, camaraderie, imagination, knowledge, and valor. The school's faculty and lessons are divided into five branches, each emphasizing one of these values. Cascade Bearers esteem imagination , from the dreams of the most visionary magical theorists to the innovations of creative problem-solvers of all stripes. Emerald Boughs emphasize camaraderie , the sense of community and connection to fellow Magaambyans; they also interact with those outside the Magaambya and spread the academy's message. Rain-Scribes value adaptability in thoughts and deeds, as well as a willingness to admit errors and learn from past mistakes. Tempest-Sun Mages inspire valor , not only the physical courage to stand up for friends and the school, but also the intellectual courage to consider opposing viewpoints and widen one's understanding rather than staying entrenched in a single paradigm. Uzunjati understand that knowledge lives in stories passed down through the generations and also is earned every day through personal experience. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-1103\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-1104\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-1105\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-1106\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-1107\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-1108\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-1109\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-1110\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-1111\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-1112\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-1113\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-1114\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-2166\" />",
