Scalding Burst Reaction Trigger A creature attempts to move through the tar; Effect A scalding burst of hot tar burns the creature, which must immediately attempt a DC 28 Reflex save. Critical Success The creature takes no damage. Success The creature takes 3d6 fire damage. Failure The creature takes 6d6 fire damage and 1d6 persistent fire damage. Critical Failure The creature takes 9d6 fire damage, 2d6 persistent fire damage and takes a –10-foot status penalty to its Speed as long as it continues to take the persistent fire damage from the hot tar clinging to it. --- Routine (1 action) The bubbling lake of tar churns and sputters.
