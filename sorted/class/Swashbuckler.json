For you, battle is a dance where you move among foes with style and grace. You dart among combatants with flair and land powerful finishing moves with a flick of the wrist and a flash of the blade, all while countering attacks with elegant ripostes that keep enemies off balance. Harassing and thwarting your foes lets you charm fate and cheat death time and again with aplomb and plenty of flair._\r\n\r\n**Key Ability: Dexterity** <br />\r\nAt 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Dexterity.\r\n\r\n**Hit Points: 10 plus your Constitution modifier** <br />\r\nYou increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Classes/Iconic_Jirelle.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Key Terms</title>\r\n\r\nYou'll see these terms in many swashbuckler abilities. \n\n**[Finisher](/Traits.aspx?ID=322)**: Finishers are spectacular finishing moves that use your panache. You can use a finisher only if you have panache, and you lose your panache immediately after performing a finisher. Once you use a finisher, you can't use actions that have the [attack](/Traits.aspx?ID=15) trait for the rest of your turn. Some actions with the finisher trait also grant an effect on a failure. Effects added on a failure don't apply on a critical failure. If your finisher action succeeds, you can still choose to apply the failure effect instead. For example, you might do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance. \n\n[**Flourish**](/Traits.aspx?ID=73): Actions with this trait are special techniques that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn. \n\n**[Stance](/Traits.aspx?ID=152)**: A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and you remain in that stance for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you use an action with the stance trait, you can't use another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Roleplaying the Swashbuckler</title>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">During Combat Encounters...</title>\r\nYou show off to gain panache, leveraging your flair to build up to powerful finishing moves.

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Panache</title>\r\nYou care as much about the way you accomplish something as whether you actually accomplish it in the first place. When you perform an action with particular bravado, you can leverage this moment of verve to perform spectacular, deadly maneuvers. This state of flair is called panache, and you are either in a state of panache or you are not.\n\n You gain panache by successfully performing the skill check associated with specific actions that have a bit of flair, including [Tumble Through](/Actions.aspx?ID=29) and additional actions determined by your [swashbuckler's style](/classes/swashbuckler/styles). At the GM's discretion, after succeeding at a check to perform a particularly daring action, such as swinging on a chandelier or sliding down a drapery, you also gain panache if your result is high enough (typically the very hard DC for your level, but the GM can choose a different threshold).\n\n While you have panache, you gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speeds and gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to Tumble Through or to take any actions that give you panache due to your style. The precise strike class feature also causes you to deal extra precision damage while you have panache. Powerful finisher actions, including Confident Finisher can be used only while you have panache and cause you to lose your panache. \n\nNormally, you gain and use panache only in combat encounters; when an encounter ends, you lose panache.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Swashbuckler's Style</title>\r\nAs a swashbuckler, you have your own distinctive style that enables you to gracefully handle everyday events and life-or- death situations alike. Choose a swashbuckler's style. This style determines the additional actions you use to gain panache and makes you trained in the skill related to that action. \n\nA list of all swashbuckler's styles can be found [here](/classes/swashbuckler/styles).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Precise Strike</title>\r\nYou strike with flair. When you have panache and you Strike with an agile or finesse melee weapon or agile or finesse unarmed attack, you deal 2 additional precision damage. If the strike is part of a finisher, the additional damage is 2d6 precision damage instead.\n\n As your swashbuckler level increases, so does your additional damage for precise strike. Increase the amount of additional damage on a Strike and the number of additional dice on a finisher by one at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Confident Finisher</title>\r\nYou gain an elegant finishing attack you can make when you have panache. You gain the Confident Finisher action.\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-550\" />\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Swashbuckler Feats</title>\r\nAt 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a [swashbuckler class feat](/Classes.aspx?ID=15/feats).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Skill Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">General Feats</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Great Fortitude</title>\r\nYour physique is incredibly hardy, granting you increased endurance. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Opportune Riposte</title>\r\nYou turn the tables on foes who fumble, capitalizing immediately on their mistake. You gain the Opportune Riposte reaction.\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-551\" />\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Skill Increases</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.\n\n At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Stylish Tricks</title>\r\nAt 3rd level, 7th level, and 15th level, you gain a skill feat. This feat must be for [Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) or the trained skill from your swashbuckler's style.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Vivacious Speed</title>\r\nWhen you've made an impression, you move even faster than normal, darting about the battlefield with incredible speed. Increase the status bonus to your Speeds when you have panache to a +10-foot status bonus; this bonus increases by 5 feet at 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th levels. When you don't have panache, you still get half this status bonus to your Speed, rounded down to the nearest 5-foot increment.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Ability Boosts</title>\r\nAt 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Ancestry Feats</title>\r\nIn addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Weapon Expertise</title>\r\nYou've dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to expert. You gain access to the critical specialization effects of all weapons for which you have expert proficiency.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 7\">Evasion</title>\r\nYou've learned to move quickly to avoid explosions, a dragon's breath, and worse. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 7\">Weapon Specialization</title>\r\nYou've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master and 4 if you're legendary.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 9\">Exemplary Finisher</title>\r\nYou execute your finishing moves with spectacular flair, adding special effects to your finishers. If a Strike you make as part of a finisher hits a foe, you add one of the following effects to the Strike, depending on your swashbuckler's style. \n\nA list of all swashbuckler's styles can be found [here](/classes/swashbuckler/styles).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 9\">Swashbuckler Expertise</title>\r\nYou perform swashbuckling techniques with exceptional flair, making them harder to resist. Your proficiency rank for your swashbuckler class DC increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Continuous Flair</title>\r\nWhile not equal to the heights of your panache in combat, you have a dramatic flair about you in any situation. Whenever you succeed at a check during exploration that would have granted you panache in combat, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to further checks for actions that would grant you panache in combat. This benefit ends when the exploration changes to a different scene (as determined by the GM) or shifts to an encounter or downtime.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Vigilant Senses</title>\r\nThrough your adventures, you've developed keen awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Improved Evasion</title>\r\nYour ability to elude danger is matchless. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to legendary. When you roll a critical failure on a Reflex save, you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure on a Reflex save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Light Armor Expertise</title>\r\nYou've learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Weapon Mastery</title>\r\nYou fully understand your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple and martial weapons and unarmed attacks increase to master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 15\">Greater Weapon Specialization</title>\r\nYour damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 15\">Keen Flair</title>\r\nYou inflict particularly devastating attacks on even well-defended foes. When you Strike with a weapon or unarmed attack with which you have master proficiency, if you roll a 19 on the die and the roll is a success, you critically succeed instead.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 17\">Resolve</title>\r\nYou've steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 19\">Eternal Confidence</title>\r\nAs a swashbuckler at the peak of your skill, you swell with confidence and bravado in every attack. Your proficiency rank for your swashbuckler class DC increases to master.\n\n When you Strike as part of a finisher or Opportune Riposte, you can give the Strike the failure effect from the Confident Finisher action, including the increase from [Precise Finisher](/Feats.aspx?ID=1536) if you have that feat. You can do so only if the Strike uses a weapon or unarmed attack that you could use for Confident Finisher.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 19\">Light Armor Mastery</title>\r\nYour skill with light armor improves, increasing your ability to dodge blows. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to master.",

Harassing and thwarting your foes lets you charm fate and cheat death time and again with aplomb and plenty of flair. Key Ability: Dexterity At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Dexterity. Hit Points: 10 plus your Constitution modifier You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. Key Terms You'll see these terms in many swashbuckler abilities. Finisher : Finishers are spectacular finishing moves that use your panache. You can use a finisher only if you have panache, and you lose your panache immediately after performing a finisher. Once you use a finisher, you can't use actions that have the attack trait for the rest of your turn. Some actions with the finisher trait also grant an effect on a failure. Effects added on a failure don't apply on a critical failure. If your finisher action succeeds, you can still choose to apply the failure effect instead. For example, you might do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance. Flourish : Actions with this trait are special techniques that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn. Stance : A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and you remain in that stance for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you use an action with the stance trait, you can't use another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode. Roleplaying the Swashbuckler During Combat Encounters... You show off to gain panache, leveraging your flair to build up to powerful finishing moves. You stay nimble, moving into the best position to perform your maneuvers while dodging enemy blows and responding with swift ripostes. Depending on your swashbuckler's style, you might dance among your foes; slip past their defenses; or beguile, distract, or frighten them. During Social Encounters... You are equally likely to charm or intimidate others—or both. You might be an adept socialite, or you might create distractions for others who do the talking. While Exploring... You keep a careful eye on your surroundings and other people, always prepared to leap into action with bravado and flair. You interact with the environment in bold, sweeping strokes rather than skulking to avoid detection. In Downtime... You might carouse at the tavern, repair and maintain your armaments, or train to learn new techniques. To maintain your impressive reputation, you might build an organization in your name or establish a following of admirers. You Might... Portray yourself as a heroic daredevil or a roguish braggart, knowing you can live up to the image you present. Hold yourself in high esteem, confident in your abilities and your reputation. Practice your skills and maneuvers regularly to ensure you never grow rusty. Others Probably... Admire your theatrics, bravado, and skill with a blade. Find you arrogant unless they know you well enough to appreciate your style. Underestimate how much of a threat you pose until they face the end of your deadly blade. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics.

Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class. Panache You care as much about the way you accomplish something as whether you actually accomplish it in the first place. When you perform an action with particular bravado, you can leverage this moment of verve to perform spectacular, deadly maneuvers. This state of flair is called panache, and you are either in a state of panache or you are not. You gain panache by successfully performing the skill check associated with specific actions that have a bit of flair, including Tumble Through and additional actions determined by your swashbuckler's style. At the GM's discretion, after succeeding at a check to perform a particularly daring action, such as swinging on a chandelier or sliding down a drapery, you also gain panache if your result is high enough (typically the very hard DC for your level, but the GM can choose a different threshold). While you have panache, you gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speeds and gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to Tumble Through or to take any actions that give you panache due to your style. The precise strike class feature also causes you to deal extra precision damage while you have panache. Powerful finisher actions, including Confident Finisher can be used only while you have panache and cause you to lose your panache. Normally, you gain and use panache only in combat encounters; when an encounter ends, you lose panache. Swashbuckler's Style As a swashbuckler, you have your own distinctive style that enables you to gracefully handle everyday events and life-or- death situations alike. Choose a swashbuckler's style. This style determines the additional actions you use to gain panache and makes you trained in the skill related to that action. A list of all swashbuckler's styles can be found here. Precise Strike You strike with flair. When you have panache and you Strike with an agile or finesse melee weapon or agile or finesse unarmed attack, you deal 2 additional precision damage. If the strike is part of a finisher, the additional damage is 2d6 precision damage instead. As your swashbuckler level increases, so does your additional damage for precise strike. Increase the amount of additional damage on a Strike and the number of additional dice on a finisher by one at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels. Confident Finisher You gain an elegant finishing attack you can make when you have panache. You gain the Confident Finisher action. Swashbuckler Feats At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a swashbuckler class feat. Skill Feats At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat. General Feats At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. Great Fortitude Your physique is incredibly hardy, granting you increased endurance. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert. Opportune Riposte You turn the tables on foes who fumble, capitalizing immediately on their mistake. You gain the Opportune Riposte reaction. Skill Increases At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert. At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master. Stylish Tricks At 3rd level, 7th level, and 15th level, you gain a skill feat. This feat must be for Acrobatics or the trained skill from your swashbuckler's style. Vivacious Speed When you've made an impression, you move even faster than normal, darting about the battlefield with incredible speed. Increase the status bonus to your Speeds when you have panache to a +10-foot status bonus; this bonus increases by 5 feet at 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th levels. When you don't have panache, you still get half this status bonus to your Speed, rounded down to the nearest 5-foot increment. Ability Boosts At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18. Ancestry Feats In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.

Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead. Weapon Specialization You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master and 4 if you're legendary. Exemplary Finisher You execute your finishing moves with spectacular flair, adding special effects to your finishers.

A list of all swashbuckler's styles can be found here. Swashbuckler Expertise You perform swashbuckling techniques with exceptional flair, making them harder to resist. Your proficiency rank for your swashbuckler class DC increases to expert. Continuous Flair While not equal to the heights of your panache in combat, you have a dramatic flair about you in any situation. Whenever you succeed at a check during exploration that would have granted you panache in combat, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to further checks for actions that would grant you panache in combat. This benefit ends when the exploration changes to a different scene (as determined by the GM) or shifts to an encounter or downtime. Vigilant Senses Through your adventures, you've developed keen awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master. Improved Evasion Your ability to elude danger is matchless. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to legendary.

Greater Weapon Specialization Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary. Keen Flair You inflict particularly devastating attacks on even well-defended foes. When you Strike with a weapon or unarmed attack with which you have master proficiency, if you roll a 19 on the die and the roll is a success, you critically succeed instead. Resolve You've steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead. Eternal Confidence As a swashbuckler at the peak of your skill, you swell with confidence and bravado in every attack. Your proficiency rank for your swashbuckler class DC increases to master. When you Strike as part of a finisher or Opportune Riposte, you can give the Strike the failure effect from the Confident Finisher action, including the increase from Precise Finisher if you have that feat. You can do so only if the Strike uses a weapon or unarmed attack that you could use for Confident Finisher.
