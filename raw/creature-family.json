Born of supernatural creatures who kill and consume the child’s father, changelings are deposited into their father’s society to be raised. These offspring appear to be members of their paternal ancestry, and changelings have been found among dwarves, gnomes, orcs, goblins, and numerous others, but human-ancestry changelings are by far the most common. Within the normal range for their ancestry, changelings tend toward slighter builds, darker hair, and pale complexions, though their most common feature is a nearly universal heterochromia, leading to widespread superstition about individuals with differently colored eyes.\n\n As changelings come of age, they sometimes manifest abilities granted by their hag heritage. Some gain the ability to see in the dark, some grow fingernails long and hard enough to serve as claws, and others gain even stranger abilities specific to their hag mother. For instance, dream mays, the children of night hags or their cousins the dreamthief hags, can gain an enhanced ability to resist the magic of dreams and sleep. Other types of changelings include slag mays, the children of annis hags; callow mays, the children of green hags; brine mays, the children of sea hags; and others for each type of hag. As beings infused with supernatural power, changelings find themselves able to command various traditions of magic, with many drawn to either the occult magic common among hags or primal magic.\n\n At roughly the same time in their lives, many changelings— women in particular—begin to hear the Call, a psychic urging from their hag mother luring them away from the communities that raised them.

Born of supernatural creatures who kill and consume the child’s father, changelings are deposited into their father’s society to be raised. These offspring appear to be members of their paternal ancestry, and changelings have been found among dwarves, gnomes, orcs, goblins, and numerous others, but human-ancestry changelings are by far the most common. Within the normal range for their ancestry, changelings tend toward slighter builds, darker hair, and pale complexions, though their most common feature is a nearly universal heterochromia, leading to widespread superstition about individuals with differently colored eyes. As changelings come of age, they sometimes manifest abilities granted by their hag heritage. Some gain the ability to see in the dark, some grow fingernails long and hard enough to serve as claws, and others gain even stranger abilities specific to their hag mother. For instance, dream mays, the children of night hags or their cousins the dreamthief hags, can gain an enhanced ability to resist the magic of dreams and sleep. Other types of changelings include slag mays, the children of annis hags; callow mays, the children of green hags; brine mays, the children of sea hags; and others for each type of hag. As beings infused with supernatural power, changelings find themselves able to command various traditions of magic, with many drawn to either the occult magic common among hags or primal magic. At roughly the same time in their lives, many changelings— women in particular—begin to hear the Call, a psychic urging from their hag mother luring them away from the communities that raised them. If followed, the Call eventually leads the changeling to the hag’s coven, where they are subjected to terrible rituals that twist them into hags themselves.

Svirfneblins, as deep gnomes call themselves, have skin the color of gray or brown stone. While deep gnome males are bald, women have thin, pale-gray hair, and all have the large, expressive eyes typical among all gnomes. A deep gnome is 3 feet tall and weighs approximately 65 pounds. Deep gnomes rarely interact with those outside of their small cavern communities, and they are slow to trust outsiders, sometimes keeping them imprisoned for years simply to prevent them from informing others of the deep gnome settlement.\n\n The first deep gnomes rose in the underground world some time after their early gnome ancestors migrated from the First World to Golarion. A group of these migrants elected to settle underground instead of on the surface, and it was from these gnomes that the svirfneblin came to be. Some believe the gnomes chose the Darklands as their home to watch for and stop any evil fey who might infiltrate the underground region, but much like the exact reasons for the gnomes' relocation, their motivation has been lost to time. Thousands of years of living in subterranean caverns with little to no light transformed the physical characteristics of the gnomes living there into those of the deep gnome of today.\n\n Though deep gnomes may seem dour and recalcitrant at first glance, they retain the fey blood of their ancestors. In fact, deep gnomes are sometimes more emotionally erratic than their gnome cousins, lashing out violently at what seems like the smallest provocation. Such an explosion is often followed by an extended period of quiet brooding. Despite this, deep gnome communities are close-knit, as each citizen knows when to give the others the space they require to process their feelings.\n\n Many deep gnome settlements have clashed with nearby [duergar](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=38) communities for myriad reasons: resources, territory, and even religion and morality. Over the centuries, some of these disputes have evolved into full wars, with many lives lost on both sides. Neither deep gnomes nor duergars are particularly proud of these conflicts, but both insist they were in the right each time. The ferocity with which most duergars fight has left a deep impression on the psyches of some deep gnome communities, leading them to distrust all dwarves and dwarf-like ancestries even more than other strangers. This can result in non-duergar dwarves being driven off from deep gnome cities before being able to explain themselves. A dwarf and even those traveling with a dwarf require patience and tenacity when attempting to deal with deep gnomes holding such views. Svirfneblins value crafting and many decorate their cavernous homes with paintings on the walls, often incorporating the rock in clever ways. They also value crystals and gems, making jewelry and beads that they string through their hair.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Deep Gnome Rockwarden](/Monsters.aspx?ID=96) (Creature 5), [Deep Gnome Scout](/Monsters.aspx?ID=93) (Creature 1), [Deep Gnome Warrior](/Monsters.aspx?ID=94) (Creature 2)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Deep Gnome Faith</title>\r\n\r\nWhile most deep gnomes aren’t particularly religious, they respect the spirits of nature, especially those found within earth and stone.

Svirfneblins, as deep gnomes call themselves, have skin the color of gray or brown stone. While deep gnome males are bald, women have thin, pale-gray hair, and all have the large, expressive eyes typical among all gnomes. A deep gnome is 3 feet tall and weighs approximately 65 pounds. Deep gnomes rarely interact with those outside of their small cavern communities, and they are slow to trust outsiders, sometimes keeping them imprisoned for years simply to prevent them from informing others of the deep gnome settlement. The first deep gnomes rose in the underground world some time after their early gnome ancestors migrated from the First World to Golarion. A group of these migrants elected to settle underground instead of on the surface, and it was from these gnomes that the svirfneblin came to be. Some believe the gnomes chose the Darklands as their home to watch for and stop any evil fey who might infiltrate the underground region, but much like the exact reasons for the gnomes' relocation, their motivation has been lost to time. Thousands of years of living in subterranean caverns with little to no light transformed the physical characteristics of the gnomes living there into those of the deep gnome of today. Though deep gnomes may seem dour and recalcitrant at first glance, they retain the fey blood of their ancestors. In fact, deep gnomes are sometimes more emotionally erratic than their gnome cousins, lashing out violently at what seems like the smallest provocation. Such an explosion is often followed by an extended period of quiet brooding. Despite this, deep gnome communities are close-knit, as each citizen knows when to give the others the space they require to process their feelings. Many deep gnome settlements have clashed with nearby duergar communities for myriad reasons: resources, territory, and even religion and morality. Over the centuries, some of these disputes have evolved into full wars, with many lives lost on both sides. Neither deep gnomes nor duergars are particularly proud of these conflicts, but both insist they were in the right each time. The ferocity with which most duergars fight has left a deep impression on the psyches of some deep gnome communities, leading them to distrust all dwarves and dwarf-like ancestries even more than other strangers. This can result in non-duergar dwarves being driven off from deep gnome cities before being able to explain themselves. A dwarf and even those traveling with a dwarf require patience and tenacity when attempting to deal with deep gnomes holding such views. Svirfneblins value crafting and many decorate their cavernous homes with paintings on the walls, often incorporating the rock in clever ways. They also value crystals and gems, making jewelry and beads that they string through their hair. Members Deep Gnome Rockwarden (Creature 5), Deep Gnome Scout (Creature 1), Deep Gnome Warrior (Creature 2) Deep Gnome Faith While most deep gnomes aren’t particularly religious, they respect the spirits of nature, especially those found within earth and stone.

The temptations they offer mortals range from great powers granted by the signing of an infernal contract to twisted favors following a whispered pledge to a diabolic patron, or any number of even subtler exchanges. Those who succumb to these temptations find themselves consigned to an afterlife of endless torment in the pits of Hell, wherein the only hope of escape lies in the chance of being promoted to become a devil in the infernal ranks. Every devil has a specific role to play in the upkeep of the remorseless bureaucratic machine that is Hell, from soldiers and scholars to inquisitors, lawyers, judges, and executioners. Lowly lemures and imps perform subservient labor to more powerful and specialized devils, such as contract devils and erinyes, while the greatest pit fiends command entire infernal armies.

","type":"Creature Family","url":"/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=35","weakness":{}}},{"_index":"aon18","_id":"creature-family-36","_score":4.166701,"_source":{"breadcrumbs_spa":[],"category":"creature-family","creature_family":"Drake","creature_family_markdown":"Drake","exclude_from_search":false,"id":"creature-family-36","markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Creature Family\">[Drake](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=36)</title>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 130</row>\n\nRavenous, bestial, and driven by instinct—drakes are primitive draconic monsters who bear a fraction of the terrifying might of their larger cousins but little (if any) of the cunning. While they’re weaker, slower, and less inclined toward reason than dragons, drakes are nonetheless a menace to creatures and settlements around them. Their propensity for forming raiding parties—small social groups fittingly called “rampages”—makes them all the more dangerous; a single rampage of river drakes can quickly lay waste to a waterside village, and roving rampages of desert drakes are a plague to caravan traders.\n\n Drakes share a number of physical characteristics that unite them as one species despite their wide variety of habitats and abilities. For example, drakes lack forearms, leaving them only their formidable jaws and thick-scaled tails with which to attack if engaged at melee range. Most drakes would rather avoid close combat, however, preferring to use their breath weapons to wreak havoc in wide swaths from comfortable distances while flying overhead. Finally, all drakes have small reservoirs of their ancestral draconic power that they can tap into to perform incredible feats of speed. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Drake Eggs</title> While drake hides aren’t any more valuable than those of other, similarly sized creatures, drake eggs are prized commodities. While they are used as components in powerful spells as well as eaten by various cultures, the most common use for drake eggs is hatching and rearing drakes to serve as mounts and guardians.\n\n A typical drake lays a clutch of 2d4 eggs every 5 years. Eggs hatch within 3 to 6 weeks, during which time they must be kept in conditions appropriate to their natural environment, perhaps the most difficult aspect of drake husbandry. While it is generally easy for breeders to incubate the eggs of desert or jungle drakes (which require mildly warm temperatures to hatch) or river drakes (which must be submerged in running water), the eggs of flame and frost drakes require extreme temperatures in order to hatch, which can be difficult to replicate safely.\n\n A drake egg has Hardness 3, 5 HP, and BT 5. The coloration of drake eggs varies only slightly from one species to the next. A creature must succeed at a DC 20 Nature check, or a relevant DC 20 Lore check, to identify the drake species of a specific egg.\n\n Once a drake hatches, it imprints on the first creature that it sees. A creature imprinted on in this way gains a +5 bonus to Nature checks to train or command that drake.

While they’re weaker, slower, and less inclined toward reason than dragons, drakes are nonetheless a menace to creatures and settlements around them. Their propensity for forming raiding parties—small social groups fittingly called “rampages”—makes them all the more dangerous; a single rampage of river drakes can quickly lay waste to a waterside village, and roving rampages of desert drakes are a plague to caravan traders. Drakes share a number of physical characteristics that unite them as one species despite their wide variety of habitats and abilities. For example, drakes lack forearms, leaving them only their formidable jaws and thick-scaled tails with which to attack if engaged at melee range. Most drakes would rather avoid close combat, however, preferring to use their breath weapons to wreak havoc in wide swaths from comfortable distances while flying overhead. Finally, all drakes have small reservoirs of their ancestral draconic power that they can tap into to perform incredible feats of speed. Drake Eggs While drake hides aren’t any more valuable than those of other, similarly sized creatures, drake eggs are prized commodities. While they are used as components in powerful spells as well as eaten by various cultures, the most common use for drake eggs is hatching and rearing drakes to serve as mounts and guardians. A typical drake lays a clutch of 2d4 eggs every 5 years. Eggs hatch within 3 to 6 weeks, during which time they must be kept in conditions appropriate to their natural environment, perhaps the most difficult aspect of drake husbandry. While it is generally easy for breeders to incubate the eggs of desert or jungle drakes (which require mildly warm temperatures to hatch) or river drakes (which must be submerged in running water), the eggs of flame and frost drakes require extreme temperatures in order to hatch, which can be difficult to replicate safely. A drake egg has Hardness 3, 5 HP, and BT 5. The coloration of drake eggs varies only slightly from one species to the next. A creature must succeed at a DC 20 Nature check, or a relevant DC 20 Lore check, to identify the drake species of a specific egg. Once a drake hatches, it imprints on the first creature that it sees. A creature imprinted on in this way gains a +5 bonus to Nature checks to train or command that drake. The market price of a drake egg varies depending on the region, the type of drake, and the exact purpose the buyer has in mind, but typically depends on the level of the drake. Because drakes are evil, dangerous, and intelligent creatures, many societies do not condone the trade of drake eggs and criminalize those who engage in it. It takes 2 years for a drake hatchling to grow to full size. A well-trained drake can make a fearsome mount or guardian, but many careless would-be drake trainers are devoured by their charges due to cruelty, overconfidence, or general lack of skill.

Fire's inherently capricious nature seems to prevent these creatures from succumbing to the influence of order. Elemental Beings The Elemental Planes—primordial realms defined by aspects of air, earth, fire, or water—are home to a diverse group of beings known as elementals.

As they are remnants of a past life and retain their intelligence, ghosts can convey long-lost information or serve as a way to inform the PCs of crucial story elements. In this way, a ghost in an adventure can provide a clue or even a complete history of a site or event. Unlike most other undead, ghosts can retain the alignment they had in life, but regardless they should remain tragic and frightening figures in play.\r\n</aside>\n\n<title level=\"2\">Creating a Ghost</title>\r\n\r\nWhile it's best to create custom ghosts to fill an adventure's specific needs, you can also use the following guidelines to turn existing living creatures into ghosts.<br /> First, increase the creature's level by 2 and change its statistics as follows. \n<ul><li>Increase AC, saves, Perception, DCs, and skill modifiers by 2. Increase the most appropriate melee attack modifier by 4 to become ghostly hand (described below), and other attack modifiers by 2.</li> <li>A ghost has a Strength modifier of –5 and a Constitution modifier of +0.</li> <li>Do not modify the ghost's Hit Points due to its new level.</li></ul> \n\n<title level=\"3\">Ghost Abilities</title> A ghost gains the incorporeal, spirit, and undead traits. Many become evil. If the base creature has any abilities or traits that come from it being a living, corporeal creature, it loses them. You might also need to adjust some abilities that conflict with the theme of a ghost. All ghosts gain the following abilities. <br />**[Darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)**<br /> **Site Bound** A typical ghost can stray only a short distance from where it was killed or the place it haunts. A typical limit is 120 feet. Some ghosts are instead bound to a room, building, item, or creature that was special to it rather than a location.<br /> **[Negative Healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=42)**<br /> **Rejuvenation** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) When a ghost is destroyed, it re-forms after 2d4 days within the location it's bound to, fully healed. A ghost can be permanently destroyed only if someone determines the reason for its existence and sets right whatever prevents the spirit from resting.<br /> **Immunities** [death](/Traits.aspx?ID=40) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126), precision, [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38)<br /> **Resistances** all damage 5 (except [force](/Traits.aspx?ID=75), [ghost touch](/Equipment.aspx?ID=297), or [positive](/Traits.aspx?ID=128); double resistance to non-[magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103)). This resistance increases to 10 at 9th level and 15 at 16th level.<br /> **Fly Speed** equal to its Speed<br /> **Ghostly Hand** All ghosts have a ghostly hand unarmed attack that deals negative damage. It typically has the [agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179), and [magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103) traits. Some ghosts wield ghostly memories of weapons they held in life, but the effect is the same. \n\n<title level=\"3\">Special Abilities</title> Select one or two of the following abilities, or potentially three if the ghost is 9th level or higher. These abilities should relate to the ghost's death or its history. You can also create new abilities or adapt those from monsters or classes to fit the theme. For DCs, use 2 + the DC of the ghost's level.<br /> **Corrupting Gaze** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> The ghost stares at a creature it can see within 30 feet. The target takes 1d6 negative damage + 1d6 per 2 levels with a basic Will save. A creature that fails its save is also [stupefied 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=37) for 1 minute.<br /> **Draining Touch** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> With a touch, the ghost attempts to drain a living creature's life force. It makes a ghostly hand Strike but deals no damage on a hit. Instead, the target becomes [drained 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=10) for 1 day, and the ghost regains HP equal to half its own level.<br /> **Frightful Moan** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([auditory](/Traits.aspx?ID=16), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61), [fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=68), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) The ghost laments its fate, forcing each living creature within 30 feet to attempt a Will save. On a failure, a creature becomes [frightened 2](/Conditions.aspx?ID=19) (or frightened 3 on a critical failure). On a success, a creature is temporarily immune to this ghost's frightful moan for 1 minute.<br /> **Inhabit Object** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> The ghost possesses an object of size Large or smaller within 20 feet, making it an [animated object](/Rituals.aspx?ID=1). This animated object's level can be no higher than the ghost's level – 2. If the target object is being held by a creature, the bearer can attempt a Will save to prevent the possession. This possession ends when the object is destroyed or the ghost leaves it. At this point, the ghost reappears in the object's square and can't Inhabit an Object again for 1d4 rounds.<br /> **Malevolent Possession** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> The ghost attempts to possess an adjacent corporeal creature. This has the same effect as the [possession](/Spells.aspx?ID=225) spell, except since the ghost doesn't have a physical body, it is unaffected by that restriction of the spell.<br /> **Telekinetic Assault** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [evocation](/Traits.aspx?ID=65)) The ghost cries out in pain and anguish as small objects and debris fly about in a 30-foot emanation. Creatures in this area take 1d6 bludgeoning damage + 1d6 per 2 levels, subject to a basic Reflex save. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Special Abilities</title>**Source** [_Pathfinder #165: Eyes of Empty Death pg. 69_](https://paizo.com/products/btq024xm)<br /> Ghosts can select from the following special abilities in addition to those listed in the _Bestiary_. Of special note, several of abilities invoke the ghost's particular circumstances and death and can be used to guide heroes toward new avenues of investigation—possibly in exchange for a good share of their Hit Points. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Beatific Appearance</title> When dealing with ghosts, appearances can be deceiving. For every gory specter exists an innocent-looking spirit, their cherubic mien enhanced with magic to lull victims to their deaths. \n\n**Beatific Appearance** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61)) **Requirements** A creature the ghost is aware of targets the ghost with an attack; **Effect** The ghost has an unusually pitiable appearance or can change its features to look like someone close to the attacker, which causes the target to pull back on its attack. The triggering creature must attempt a Will save. On a failure, the creature takes a –1 circumstance penalty to its attack roll (–2 on a critical failure). \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Cold Spot</title> Ghosts are often associated with unnatural cold, and one of the first signs of a ghostly presence is an uncanny cold spot in the air. \n\n**Cold Spot** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [cold](/Traits.aspx?ID=27), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48)) The air within 5 feet of the ghost is supernaturally cold. Characters that enter or begin their turn in the ghost's aura take 1d6 cold damage per 3 levels the ghost has ([basic](/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Fortitude save). \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Corporeal Manifestation</title> Traditionally, ghosts are thought of as wispy, insubstantial things, but not all ghosts follow this rule. \n\n**Corporeal Manifestation** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32)) The ghost loses the [incorporeal](/Traits.aspx?ID=222) trait, temporarily increasing its Strength modifier to equal its Charisma modifier. The ghost loses its immunity to precision damage and its resistance to all damage while corporeal. The ghost can resume being incorporeal by using this action again. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Dreamwalker</title> People who encounter ghosts are often plagued by nightmares, sometimes supernatural ones. Only powerful ghosts of 6th level or higher have this ability. \n\n**Dreamwalker** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [illusion](/Traits.aspx?ID=92), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) Anyone who meets the ghost or visits its bound site can become subject to this effect. The first time the subject sleeps after their ghostly encounter, they're targeted by a [_nightmare_](/Spells.aspx?ID=208) spell, with the nightmares being somehow related to the ghost. Most often this means that the subject relives the ghost's last moments alive, but there are other possibilities. If the ghost wishes, it can manipulate the dreams to send messages or even hold entire conversations with dreamers. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Fade</title> Ghosts are notorious for appearing and disappearing when least expected. \n\n**Fade** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [illusion](/Traits.aspx?ID=92)) The ghost becomes [invisible](/Conditions.aspx?ID=26) until the beginning of its next turn. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Fetch</title> A fetch is a person's double, often associated with hauntings and considered a mark of great ill omen. \n\n**Fetch** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [illusion](/Traits.aspx?ID=92)) The ghost creates an illusory double of a creature. The fetch functions as a 2nd-level [_illusory creature_](/Spells.aspx?ID=158), except that the ghost doesn't control the fetch, and the spell lasts for 1d4 hours instead of needing to Sustain the Spell. The fetch has a rudimentary intelligence and tries to imitate its original (it has a [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) skill value equal to the ghost's highest skill) but comes across as confused or vague. A ghost can have only one fetch at a time. If the creature doubled by the fetch encounters it, the creature must succeed at a Will save or become [stupefied 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=37) (stupefied 2 on a Critical Failure) for as long as they can see the fetch. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Ghost Storm</title> Most ghosts can summon a wind to rattle a window or bang a shutter, but some angry spirits can do far worse. \n\n**Ghost Storm** ([air](/Traits.aspx?ID=5), [aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [evocation](/Traits.aspx?ID=65)) Wind surrounds the ghost out to a range of 30 feet. The wind extinguishes small non-magical fires, disperses fog and mist, blows objects of light Bulk or less around, and pushes larger objects. Squares in the ghost's aura are difficult terrain and flying creatures are always considered to be [moving against the wind](/Rules.aspx?ID=400). The ghost can dismiss or resume the wind as an action, which has the [concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32) trait. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Haunted House</title> Ghosts tend to haunt a specific place, remaining for eternity within a tightly bound space. They might haunt their graves or the sites of their death, but either way they rarely venture far. In their home, though, a ghost holds great power. \n\n**Haunted House** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> **Frequency** once every 10 minutes; **Effect** The ghost extends its presence throughout its bound site until the end of its next turn. Within this area, the ghost can extend its senses, gaining the benefits of [all-around vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=1), and can make ghostly hand attacks or use special abilities originating from any part of the area. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Lynchpin</title> Ghosts are typically thought of as solitary beings, but sometimes their will and rage are so strong that they drag others back from the grave as well. \n\n**Lynchpin** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) The ghost extends some of its nature to one or more [undead](/Traits.aspx?ID=160) of equal or lower level, who are connected to the ghost's story and unfinished business. These undead gain the ghost's Rejuvenation ability and can't be permanently destroyed so long as the ghost exists. If the ghost is laid to rest, all linked undead are likewise instantly destroyed. Linked undead  often, but not always, share the ghost's Site-Bound ability as well. The ghost doesn't have any control over such undead, and indeed the ghost and their partners in eternity may be unremittingly hostile to one another. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Memento Mori</title> For most ghosts, death is a traumatic event, and an angry spirit is perfectly willing to share their pain with others. \n\n**Memento Mori** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [illusion](/Traits.aspx?ID=92), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) The ghost causes one creature within 30 feet to relive the ghost's death. The target must succeed at a Will save or see and feel what the ghost did, taking 1d4 [persistent mental damage](/Conditions.aspx?ID=29) per 2 levels the ghost has. All other creatures are [concealed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=4) to the target until the persistent damage ends. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Phanstamagoria</title> Ghost are rarely aware of the passage of time and see no difference between the homes they lived in long ago and the ruins they haunt now. Some ghosts can spread that delusion to others. \n\n**Phantasmagoria** <actions string=\"Three Actions\" /> ([auditory](/Traits.aspx?ID=16), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [illusion](/Traits.aspx?ID=92), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [olfactory](/Traits.aspx?ID=246), [visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=163)) The ghost causes all or part of its bound site to look, sound, feel, and smell like a different kind of place, and can populate it with simple illusions of people or animals. Typically, the ghost can recreate only a handful of images, usually different versions of its bound site as it appeared during the ghost's life. This can't disguise any creatures in the area, though it can cause minor, cosmetic changes (like causing a creature's clothing to appear nicer for a party or bloodstained for a battle). Any creature that touches the illusion or uses the [Seek](/Actions.aspx?ID=84) action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve it. Creatures can't leave the area of the illusion until they successfully disbelieve it. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Pyre's Memory</title> Burning is one of the most painful ways to die, and ghosts that burned to death are often more aggressive and violent than other incorporeal creatures. Their bound site is often scorched or scarred with some other evidence of fire. \n\n**Pyre's Memory** <actions string=\"Three Actions\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [evocation](/Traits.aspx?ID=65), [fire](/Traits.aspx?ID=72)) The ghost causes great gouts of flame to erupt without warning. The ghost picks three 5-foot squares within 30 feet. Creatures that start in or enter one of these squares take 1d6 fire damage per 2 levels the ghost has, subject to a [basic](/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Reflex save. The flames last for 1 minute and don't set other things alight unless the ghost wishes. If the ghost uses this ability again, it dismisses any existing flames. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Revenant</title> Not all ghosts try to possess the living. Some prefer to ride corpses instead, wrenching bodies from shallow graves to serve as their hosts. \n\n**Revenant** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> or 1 hour; **Effect** The ghost possesses and transforms an adjacent corpse (this requires 2 actions if the ghost is possessing its own corpse; otherwise, it takes an hour). The possessed corpse uses the statistics of a non-[incorporeal](/Traits.aspx?ID=222) [undead](/Traits.aspx?ID=160) 2 levels lower than the ghost, and the ghost possesses it as if using the [_possession_](/Spells.aspx?ID=225) spell. The specific undead is determined by the nature of the ghost and the corpse—[ghoul](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=52), [wights](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=163), and [dullahans](/Monsters.aspx?ID=171) are all common, but almost any undead is possible.

Members Ghost Commoner (Creature 4), Ghost Mage (Creature 10), Ghost Pirate Captain (Creature 8), Hungry Ghost (Creature 6) A Rebirth in Death I never thought in my living years that I myself would become a ghost. Initially, I was shocked. How could I possibly be denied a proper final death? After centuries of reflection, I understood: Nex must yet live! Until I see his corpse for myself, I will remain, I will prepare, and I will triumph. My only impediment involves finding a way to step free of Mechitar... Building Ghosts Note that the ghost mage is built from the ground up, rather than by applying the ghost rules to a once-living creature, so its numbers don’t exactly match the values listed above. This is usually the better way to go if you have the time, as it allows you to hand-craft a ghost for the situation. Custom Ghosts Ghosts work best in adventures when used sparingly. As they are remnants of a past life and retain their intelligence, ghosts can convey long-lost information or serve as a way to inform the PCs of crucial story elements. In this way, a ghost in an adventure can provide a clue or even a complete history of a site or event. Unlike most other undead, ghosts can retain the alignment they had in life, but regardless they should remain tragic and frightening figures in play. Creating a Ghost While it's best to create custom ghosts to fill an adventure's specific needs, you can also use the following guidelines to turn existing living creatures into ghosts. First, increase the creature's level by 2 and change its statistics as follows. Increase AC, saves, Perception, DCs, and skill modifiers by 2. Increase the most appropriate melee attack modifier by 4 to become ghostly hand (described below), and other attack modifiers by 2. A ghost has a Strength modifier of –5 and a Constitution modifier of +0. Do not modify the ghost's Hit Points due to its new level. Ghost Abilities A ghost gains the incorporeal, spirit, and undead traits. Many become evil. If the base creature has any abilities or traits that come from it being a living, corporeal creature, it loses them. You might also need to adjust some abilities that conflict with the theme of a ghost. All ghosts gain the following abilities. Darkvision Site Bound A typical ghost can stray only a short distance from where it was killed or the place it haunts. A typical limit is 120 feet. Some ghosts are instead bound to a room, building, item, or creature that was special to it rather than a location. Negative Healing Rejuvenation (divine, necromancy) When a ghost is destroyed, it re-forms after 2d4 days within the location it's bound to, fully healed. A ghost can be permanently destroyed only if someone determines the reason for its existence and sets right whatever prevents the spirit from resting. Immunities death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, precision, unconscious Resistances all damage 5 (except force, ghost touch, or positive; double resistance to non-magical). This resistance increases to 10 at 9th level and 15 at 16th level. Fly Speed equal to its Speed Ghostly Hand All ghosts have a ghostly hand unarmed attack that deals negative damage. It typically has the agile, finesse, and magical traits. Some ghosts wield ghostly memories of weapons they held in life, but the effect is the same. Special Abilities Select one or two of the following abilities, or potentially three if the ghost is 9th level or higher. These abilities should relate to the ghost's death or its history. You can also create new abilities or adapt those from monsters or classes to fit the theme. For DCs, use 2 + the DC of the ghost's level. Corrupting Gaze Two Actions The ghost stares at a creature it can see within 30 feet. The target takes 1d6 negative damage + 1d6 per 2 levels with a basic Will save. A creature that fails its save is also stupefied 1 for 1 minute. Draining Touch Two Actions With a touch, the ghost attempts to drain a living creature's life force. It makes a ghostly hand Strike but deals no damage on a hit. Instead, the target becomes drained 1 for 1 day, and the ghost regains HP equal to half its own level. Frightful Moan Two Actions (auditory, divine, emotion, enchantment, fear, mental) The ghost laments its fate, forcing each living creature within 30 feet to attempt a Will save. On a failure, a creature becomes frightened 2 (or frightened 3 on a critical failure). On a success, a creature is temporarily immune to this ghost's frightful moan for 1 minute. Inhabit Object Single Action The ghost possesses an object of size Large or smaller within 20 feet, making it an animated object. This animated object's level can be no higher than the ghost's level – 2. If the target object is being held by a creature, the bearer can attempt a Will save to prevent the possession. This possession ends when the object is destroyed or the ghost leaves it. At this point, the ghost reappears in the object's square and can't Inhabit an Object again for 1d4 rounds. Malevolent Possession Two Actions The ghost attempts to possess an adjacent corporeal creature. This has the same effect as the possession spell, except since the ghost doesn't have a physical body, it is unaffected by that restriction of the spell. Telekinetic Assault Two Actions (divine, evocation) The ghost cries out in pain and anguish as small objects and debris fly about in a 30-foot emanation. Creatures in this area take 1d6 bludgeoning damage + 1d6 per 2 levels, subject to a basic Reflex save. Special Abilities Source Pathfinder #165: Eyes of Empty Death pg. 69 Ghosts can select from the following special abilities in addition to those listed in the Bestiary . Of special note, several of abilities invoke the ghost's particular circumstances and death and can be used to guide heroes toward new avenues of investigation—possibly in exchange for a good share of their Hit Points. Beatific Appearance When dealing with ghosts, appearances can be deceiving. For every gory specter exists an innocent-looking spirit, their cherubic mien enhanced with magic to lull victims to their deaths. Beatific Appearance Reaction (divine, enchantment) Requirements A creature the ghost is aware of targets the ghost with an attack; Effect The ghost has an unusually pitiable appearance or can change its features to look like someone close to the attacker, which causes the target to pull back on its attack. The triggering creature must attempt a Will save. On a failure, the creature takes a –1 circumstance penalty to its attack roll (–2 on a critical failure). Cold Spot Ghosts are often associated with unnatural cold, and one of the first signs of a ghostly presence is an uncanny cold spot in the air. Cold Spot (aura, cold, divine) The air within 5 feet of the ghost is supernaturally cold. Characters that enter or begin their turn in the ghost's aura take 1d6 cold damage per 3 levels the ghost has (basic Fortitude save). Corporeal Manifestation Traditionally, ghosts are thought of as wispy, insubstantial things, but not all ghosts follow this rule. Corporeal Manifestation Single Action (concentrate) The ghost loses the incorporeal trait, temporarily increasing its Strength modifier to equal its Charisma modifier. The ghost loses its immunity to precision damage and its resistance to all damage while corporeal. The ghost can resume being incorporeal by using this action again. Dreamwalker People who encounter ghosts are often plagued by nightmares, sometimes supernatural ones. Only powerful ghosts of 6th level or higher have this ability. Dreamwalker (divine, illusion, mental) Anyone who meets the ghost or visits its bound site can become subject to this effect. The first time the subject sleeps after their ghostly encounter, they're targeted by a nightmare spell, with the nightmares being somehow related to the ghost. Most often this means that the subject relives the ghost's last moments alive, but there are other possibilities. If the ghost wishes, it can manipulate the dreams to send messages or even hold entire conversations with dreamers. Fade Ghosts are notorious for appearing and disappearing when least expected. Fade Single Action (divine, illusion) The ghost becomes invisible until the beginning of its next turn. Fetch A fetch is a person's double, often associated with hauntings and considered a mark of great ill omen. Fetch Two Actions (divine, illusion) The ghost creates an illusory double of a creature. The fetch functions as a 2nd-level illusory creature , except that the ghost doesn't control the fetch, and the spell lasts for 1d4 hours instead of needing to Sustain the Spell. The fetch has a rudimentary intelligence and tries to imitate its original (it has a Deception skill value equal to the ghost's highest skill) but comes across as confused or vague. A ghost can have only one fetch at a time. If the creature doubled by the fetch encounters it, the creature must succeed at a Will save or become stupefied 1 (stupefied 2 on a Critical Failure) for as long as they can see the fetch. Ghost Storm Most ghosts can summon a wind to rattle a window or bang a shutter, but some angry spirits can do far worse. Ghost Storm (air, aura, divine, evocation) Wind surrounds the ghost out to a range of 30 feet. The wind extinguishes small non-magical fires, disperses fog and mist, blows objects of light Bulk or less around, and pushes larger objects. Squares in the ghost's aura are difficult terrain and flying creatures are always considered to be moving against the wind. The ghost can dismiss or resume the wind as an action, which has the concentrate trait. Haunted House Ghosts tend to haunt a specific place, remaining for eternity within a tightly bound space. They might haunt their graves or the sites of their death, but either way they rarely venture far. In their home, though, a ghost holds great power. Haunted House Single Action Frequency once every 10 minutes; Effect The ghost extends its presence throughout its bound site until the end of its next turn. Within this area, the ghost can extend its senses, gaining the benefits of all-around vision, and can make ghostly hand attacks or use special abilities originating from any part of the area. Lynchpin Ghosts are typically thought of as solitary beings, but sometimes their will and rage are so strong that they drag others back from the grave as well. Lynchpin (divine, necromancy) The ghost extends some of its nature to one or more undead of equal or lower level, who are connected to the ghost's story and unfinished business. These undead gain the ghost's Rejuvenation ability and can't be permanently destroyed so long as the ghost exists. If the ghost is laid to rest, all linked undead are likewise instantly destroyed. Linked undead often, but not always, share the ghost's Site-Bound ability as well. The ghost doesn't have any control over such undead, and indeed the ghost and their partners in eternity may be unremittingly hostile to one another. Memento Mori For most ghosts, death is a traumatic event, and an angry spirit is perfectly willing to share their pain with others. Memento Mori Two Actions (divine, illusion, mental) The ghost causes one creature within 30 feet to relive the ghost's death. The target must succeed at a Will save or see and feel what the ghost did, taking 1d4 persistent mental damage per 2 levels the ghost has. All other creatures are concealed to the target until the persistent damage ends. Phanstamagoria Ghost are rarely aware of the passage of time and see no difference between the homes they lived in long ago and the ruins they haunt now. Some ghosts can spread that delusion to others. Phantasmagoria Three Actions (auditory, divine, illusion, mental, olfactory, visual) The ghost causes all or part of its bound site to look, sound, feel, and smell like a different kind of place, and can populate it with simple illusions of people or animals. Typically, the ghost can recreate only a handful of images, usually different versions of its bound site as it appeared during the ghost's life. This can't disguise any creatures in the area, though it can cause minor, cosmetic changes (like causing a creature's clothing to appear nicer for a party or bloodstained for a battle). Any creature that touches the illusion or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve it. Creatures can't leave the area of the illusion until they successfully disbelieve it. Pyre's Memory Burning is one of the most painful ways to die, and ghosts that burned to death are often more aggressive and violent than other incorporeal creatures. Their bound site is often scorched or scarred with some other evidence of fire. Pyre's Memory Three Actions (divine, evocation, fire) The ghost causes great gouts of flame to erupt without warning. The ghost picks three 5-foot squares within 30 feet. Creatures that start in or enter one of these squares take 1d6 fire damage per 2 levels the ghost has, subject to a basic Reflex save. The flames last for 1 minute and don't set other things alight unless the ghost wishes. If the ghost uses this ability again, it dismisses any existing flames. Revenant Not all ghosts try to possess the living. Some prefer to ride corpses instead, wrenching bodies from shallow graves to serve as their hosts. Revenant Two Actions or 1 hour; Effect The ghost possesses and transforms an adjacent corpse (this requires 2 actions if the ghost is possessing its own corpse; otherwise, it takes an hour). The possessed corpse uses the statistics of a non-incorporeal undead 2 levels lower than the ghost, and the ghost possesses it as if using the possession spell. The specific undead is determined by the nature of the ghost and the corpse—ghoul, wights, and dullahans are all common, but almost any undead is possible. If the ghost ceases to possess the corpse, the corporeal undead is immediately destroyed.","type":"Creature Family","url":"/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=51","weakness":{}}},{"_index":"aon18","_id":"creature-family-52","_score":4.166701,"_source":{"breadcrumbs_spa":[],"category":"creature-family","creature_family":"Ghoul","creature_family_markdown":"Ghoul","exclude_from_search":false,"id":"creature-family-52","markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Creature Family\">[Ghoul](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=52)</title>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 168</row>\n\nFew creatures are more ubiquitous to sinister locations such as lonely graveyards and ruined crypts than the flesh-eating undead known as ghouls. \r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Barnacle Ghoul](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1001) (Creature 9), [Ghast](/Monsters.aspx?ID=219) (Creature 2), [Ghoul](/Monsters.aspx?ID=218) (Creature 1), [Ghoul Antipaladin](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2154) (Creature 9), [Ghoul Gnawer](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2144) (Creature 11), [Ghoul Razorclaw](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2155) (Creature 13), [Lacedon](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1865) (Creature 2), [Leng Ghoul](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1165) (Creature 10), [Priest of Kabriri](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1866) (Creature 5)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Ghoulish Society</title>\r\n\r\nGhouls are quite intelligent and, more so than almost any other undead, prone to forming societies and cultures (if vile and repugnant ones centered around flesh eating and acts of depravity) in tangled warrens below boneyards, or even entire cities hidden away in the depths of the Darklands.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Preternatural Patience</title>\r\n\r\n“On the second morning after the winds stopped, we woke to find that something'd crept into the hold and smashed up all the rations.

When creating a ghast, double these numerical adjustments. The monsters in this section are built from the ground up, so their numbers don't match these guidelines exactly. Custom-building ghouls is recommended if you have time, using the special abilities listed here but creating the other statistics to match what you want the ghoul to be. First, increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. \n<ul><li>Increase its AC, attack bonuses, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1.</li> <li>Increase its damage with Strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. If the creature is limited in how often it can use an ability (such as a breath weapon), increase the damage by 2 instead.</li></ul> \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Ghoul Abilities</title> A ghoul gains the undead and ghoul traits, and it usually becomes evil. If the base creature has any abilities that come from it being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as human and humanoid. You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the theme of a ghoul. All ghouls gain the following abilities. The save DC for all abilities uses the DC of the ghoul's level.<br /> **[Darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)**<br /> **[Negative Healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=42)**<br /> **Immunities** death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, unconscious<br /> **Claws** If the creature had hands, it gains a claw Strike (an agile unarmed attack that deals slashing damage plus paralysis). If it had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by its claws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If it had only non-agile attacks, its claws should deal three-quarters that damage.<br /> **Jaws** If the creature had a mouth, it gains a jaws Strike (an unarmed attack that deals slashing damage plus ghoul fever and paralysis). The damage amount should be the same as the creature's non-agile attacks.<br /> **Consume Flesh** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([manipulate](/Traits.aspx?ID=104)) **Requirements** The ghoul is adjacent to the corpse of a creature that died within the last hour. **Effect** The ghoul devours a chunk of the corpse and regains 1d6 Hit Points plus 1d6 for every 2 levels it has.

Members Barnacle Ghoul (Creature 9), Ghast (Creature 2), Ghoul (Creature 1), Ghoul Antipaladin (Creature 9), Ghoul Gnawer (Creature 11), Ghoul Razorclaw (Creature 13), Lacedon (Creature 2), Leng Ghoul (Creature 10), Priest of Kabriri (Creature 5) Ghoulish Society Ghouls are quite intelligent and, more so than almost any other undead, prone to forming societies and cultures (if vile and repugnant ones centered around flesh eating and acts of depravity) in tangled warrens below boneyards, or even entire cities hidden away in the depths of the Darklands. Preternatural Patience “On the second morning after the winds stopped, we woke to find that something'd crept into the hold and smashed up all the rations. Ninth night had just enough moonlight to make out them things out there, caperin' about. Started whisperin' on the night sixteen. And they said nothin' I wasn't already thinkin', about my empty belly and what I'd do for a bite to fill it. Gods forgive me, I was just so hungry. So hungry.” — Bronze Bunyip , logbook, final entry The First Ghouls Legend holds that the first humanoid (an elf, as it so happened) to feed upon the flesh of his brother rose as a ghoul after death, in time embracing his new life and ascending to great power as a demon lord of ghouls, graves, and secrets kept by the dead. That ghouls of humanoids warp and twist to take vaguely elven features, and that elves themselves are immune to ghoul paralysis, are unusual side effects of this ancient source, yet today, ghouls are as likely to worship other vile gods—or simply eschew faith entirely—as they are to honor the first of their kind. Whispers in the Warrens Legend holds that Briganthor, a dwarf champion of Torag, quested to root out a pack of ghouls. After slaying the undead, he stumbled upon a tome of cannibalistic prayer-recipes. As Briganthor attempted to burn the book, the warren collapsed—trapping him and his brother. Desperate for sustenance, Briganthor searched the cave-in only to conclude there was no way out. As days melted into weeks, the paladin feared they would starve. That's when the whispers came. Pleading, gnawing, begging him to open the grimoire. Creating Ghouls You can turn a living creature into a ghoul by completing the following steps. When creating a ghast, double these numerical adjustments. The monsters in this section are built from the ground up, so their numbers don't match these guidelines exactly. Custom-building ghouls is recommended if you have time, using the special abilities listed here but creating the other statistics to match what you want the ghoul to be. First, increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. Increase its AC, attack bonuses, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1. Increase its damage with Strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. If the creature is limited in how often it can use an ability (such as a breath weapon), increase the damage by 2 instead. Ghoul Abilities A ghoul gains the undead and ghoul traits, and it usually becomes evil. If the base creature has any abilities that come from it being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as human and humanoid. You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the theme of a ghoul. All ghouls gain the following abilities. The save DC for all abilities uses the DC of the ghoul's level. Darkvision Negative Healing Immunities death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, unconscious Claws If the creature had hands, it gains a claw Strike (an agile unarmed attack that deals slashing damage plus paralysis). If it had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by its claws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If it had only non-agile attacks, its claws should deal three-quarters that damage. Jaws If the creature had a mouth, it gains a jaws Strike (an unarmed attack that deals slashing damage plus ghoul fever and paralysis). The damage amount should be the same as the creature's non-agile attacks. Consume Flesh Single Action (manipulate) Requirements The ghoul is adjacent to the corpse of a creature that died within the last hour. Effect The ghoul devours a chunk of the corpse and regains 1d6 Hit Points plus 1d6 for every 2 levels it has. It can regain Hit Points from any given corpse only once. Ghoul Fever (disease) Saving Throw Fortitude; Stage 1 carrier with no ill effect (1 day); Stage 2 2d6 negative damage and regains half as many Hit Points from all healing (1 day); Stage 3 as stage 2 (1 day); Stage 4 2d6 negative damage and gains no benefit from healing (1 day); Stage 5 as stage 4 (1 day); Stage 6 dead, and rises as a ghoul the next midnight. Paralysis (incapacitation, occult, necromancy) Any living, non-elf creature hit by a ghoul's attack must succeed at a Fortitude save or become paralyzed. It can attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns, and the DC cumulatively decreases by 1 on each such save. Swift Leap Single Action (move) The ghoul jumps up to half its Speed. This movement doesn't trigger reactions. Ghast Abilities A ghast has all the abilities above, plus following additions. Stench (aura, olfactory) 10 feet A creature entering the aura or starting its turn in the aura must succeed at a Fortitude save (use a DC based on the monster's level; Core Rulebook 503) or become sickened 1 (plus slowed 1 as long as it\u001bs sickened on a critical failure). While within the aura, the creature takes a –2 circumstance penalty to saves against disease and to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune for 1 minute. Claws and Jaws As ghoul, but apply ghast fever instead of ghoul fever. Consume Flesh Single Action As ghoul, but it regains 1d6 additional Hit Points.

To a gnoll, it is almost more offensive to not eat a dead body, no matter its origin; gnolls see no point in wasting precious meat in a harsh and challenging world. Worse still is the refusal to eat the flesh of a dead gnoll, which they consider an insult to that gnoll's memory and sacrifice and an implication that the gnoll's flesh is unworthy of consumption. In fact, they refuse to eat the bodies of particularly hated foes; particularly warmongering gnolls even spike the bodies or heads of such despised enemies on tall spears, which they place around their tribal holdings to dishonor the dead and intimidate would-be invaders.<br /> Gnoll women are far stronger and more aggressive than gnoll men and are typically considered the leaders of their hunting packs and clans.

Originally created by powerful fey, they manifest when a skilled practitioner of primal magic—typically a druid—combines a nature spirit with a body carefully grown from local vegetation. The rites and materials required to create a leshy vary depending on the type of leshy. They are typically given life in an area of great natural significance, such as an arboreal’s grove, a druidic circle, a fairy ring, or a great natural wonder. Members Cactus Leshy (Creature 2), Flytrap Leshy (Creature 4), Fungus Leshy (Creature 2), Gourd Leshy (Creature 1), Leaf Leshy (Creature 0), Seaweed Leshy (Creature 3), Sunflower Leshy (Creature 1), Vine Leshy (Creature 0) Associated Monsters Because of their relative frailty, leaf leshys frequently act as liaisons and call upon more powerful forest guardians when their domains are threatened. Nymphs, sprites, and other goodly fey may respond to the call of a leaf leshy, as do arboreals and other plant creatures. Dead Leshy When a leshy dies, its body explodes in a wave of vegetation as its spirit returns to the natural world. Though leshy spirits that are called into new bodies after death typically keep only vague recollections of their pasts, they retain many of the values and habits of their former life. Leshy Communities Leshys are fairly egalitarian when interacting with their own kind. Most communities are meritocracies, rewarding leshys who defend their communities and help each other succeed, and they see working together as the best path to a successful future. Leshy Heroes Occasionally, a leshy proves so valuable to their community that they're uplifted as a hero. These admired leshys are not all warriors; outstanding artisans, caretakers, or diplomats might also be lauded as heroes.

After long years of research and the creation of a special container called a [soul cage](/Equipment.aspx?ID=488), a spellcaster takes the final step by imbibing a deadly concoction or casting dreadful incantations that transform them into a lich. While most undertake this drastic plan to continue their work or fulfill some long-term plan, others become liches because they fear death or to fulfill some malevolent purpose, such as long-sworn revenge. Regardless, the result is permanent and carries with it the potential to alter history—both that of those who transform themselves and of the countless mortals that will inevitably suffer as a result of a lich's new power.\n\n After its metamorphosis, a lich often finds some quiet place to dwell, typically protected by a variety of guardians and traps, for two primary purposes. First, a lich requires solitude in order to plan its elaborate schemes, and second, few mortals (if any) deign to interact with these legendarily corrupt necromancers. One reason begets the other, as the self-imposed isolation of a lich often drives the lich insane, further solidifying its separation from civilization. The longer a lich lives, the more meticulous a planner it becomes, secreting itself within a labyrinth of deadly puzzles, misdirection, and monsters. A lich's servants and guardians are absolutely loyal, either due to their nature (such as constructs or other undead) or as a result of compulsion using powerful magic. Many liches go mad, in time, and the nature of a lich's lair is a good indicator of the undead's current mental state.\n\n For all the protections it arrays around itself, a lich will go to greater lengths to guard its soul cage, as it knows that the destruction of this magical container spells doom for the lich. A lich is notoriously difficult to bargain with, though the threat of damaging its soul cage is a sure way to gain the upper hand in such a negotiation.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Demilich](/Monsters.aspx?ID=283) (Creature 15), [Horde Lich](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1876) (Creature 15), [Lich](/Monsters.aspx?ID=282) (Creature 12), [Runecarved Lich](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1877) (Creature 19)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_4_RelatedCreatures.png\">Associated Monsters</title>\r\n\r\nUndead minions are very common companions for a lich or demilich.

The ritual is at least 6th level, but it's always heightened to as high a level as possible for the primary caster. The skill check is tied to the primary caster's tradition ([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2) for [arcane](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=1), [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) for [primal](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=4), [Occult](/Skills.aspx?ID=11) for [occult](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=3), and [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13) for [divine](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=2)), and the caster must be a master in that skill to attempt this ritual. Secondary casters are rarely required. Before starting the ritual, the caster must construct the _soul cage_, which costs a minimum of 100 gp per level of the caster (often more) and a [Crafting](/Skills.aspx?ID=4) check with a [hard DC for the caster's level](/Rules.aspx?ID=554).\n\n Aside from these base requirements, the ritual also has at least three unique requirements. The first is a significant sacrifice crucial to the life and experiences of the primary caster. The second is a source of great power related to the caster's tradition, to be consumed during the ritual. The third is a poignant means to end the primary caster's life, consumed in the closing seconds of the ritual. If any of these are absent, or improperly performed, it reduces the degree of success for the primary caster's skill check to complete the ritual by one level for each missing requirement. Each of these should be difficult to obtain, requiring a significant quest or great personal sacrifice.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_6_Geb.png\">The Whispering Way</title>\r\n\r\nSome believe that undeath is the purest form of existence, free from pain or fear, unshackled from the cycle of life and death.

Membership is achieved only by pledging oneself to undeath with the goal of eventually achieving that state through some means or another.\n\n Lichdom is seen as one of best ways of achieving this, though other means are generally acceptable. Undead who need the living to fuel their unlife generally shun this philosophy, as its true goal of turning all life to undeath runs counter to their needs.\n\n Of all its adherents, the Whispering Tyrant is by far the most famous and successful member, nearly achieving the group's goal before being defeated by a massive alliance of mortal forces.

In addition, any creature that starts its turn in the area gains the doomed 1 condition unless it succeeds at a Will save against the lich's spell DC – 4.\n\n### Book of the Dead\n  **Animate Cage** The lich has placed their soul cage inside an [animated object](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=4) that fights fiercely to defend itself, or at the very least to elude capture. If the lich's body is destroyed, the lich can control this animated object directly, although they can't cast any spells while inside the vessel. The lich's body is often restored inside this object, being ejected from the animated object after 1d10 days in the normal manner for a soul cage. The animated object is usually at least 4 levels lower than the lich, but it doesn't engage in combat unless directly threatened or if the lich is in control of it.<br /> **Aura of Rot** ([arcane](/Traits.aspx?ID=11), [aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) The lich is surrounded by pervasive, supernatural rot. Unattended food and drink within 30 feet of the lich immediately spoils. Anyone attempting to eat or drink within this area must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or become [sickened 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=34) as the sustenance spoils before it can be ingested (ruining potions and other magical food and drink). Ordinary plants that remain within this aura for more than 1 minute wither and begin to die (depending on their size, this might take significantly longer).<br /> **Familiar Soul** The lich has an undead familiar (using the [familiar](/Rules.aspx?ID=160) rules, except it's undead instead of an animal). Instead of a traditional soul cage, this lich stores their soul in the body of their undead familiar. While doing so makes it significantly more vulnerable, the moment the lich's body is destroyed, it can take over the body of the familiar. After 1 hour, the lich can use this body to cast spells, assuming it has an appendage capable of making somatic components. After 1d10 days, the lich's body reforms as normal.<br /> Mask Death <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([arcane](/Traits.aspx?ID=11), [transmutation](/Traits.aspx?ID=157)) The lich changes their appearance to look as they did in life.

The lich [Recalls Information](/Actions.aspx?ID=26) with a skill of their choice, using the target's bonus with the skill instead of their own. If there's a very specific piece of information the lich hopes to uncover, and the target knows that information, the target can attempt a Will save to keep it secret. On a critical success, the target can give the lich faulty information instead.<br /> **Steal Soul** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> ([arcane](/Traits.aspx?ID=11), [evil](/Traits.aspx?ID=64), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) **Trigger** A creature dies within 30 feet of the lich; **Effect** The creature must attempt one final Fortitude save. On a failure, the lich siphons the soul from the dying creature, storing it in a black mote of energy that orbits the lich's skull. The creature can't be brought back from the dead while its soul is trapped in this way. Once per day, as a single action, the lich can consume a mote to heal a number of Hit Points equal to double the soul's level. This utterly destroys the soul, making the creature impossible to bring back to life without a [_wish_](/Spells.aspx?ID=377), [_miracle_](/Spells.aspx?ID=196), or similar magic. The lich can have a number of motes orbiting them equal to their Charisma modifier (to a minimum of one mote); if the lich gains an additional mote, the oldest one is released, its soul free to travel to the afterlife.<br /> **Unholy Touch** The lich's touch is suffused with evil, dealing [evil](/Traits.aspx?ID=64) damage instead of negative.

Darkvision Saving Throws +1 status bonus to all saves vs. positive Negative Healing Rejuvenation (arcane, necromancy) When a lich is destroyed, its soul immediately transfers to its soul cage. A lich can be permanently destroyed only if its soul cage is found and destroyed. Immunities death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, unconscious Resistances cold 20, physical 15 (except magic bludgeoning) Frightful Presence (aura, emotion, fear, mental) 60 feet, DC 30 Hand of the Lich All liches have a hand unarmed attack that deals 1d8 negative damage for every 3 levels and inflicts a paralyzing touch. This attack has the finesse trait. Drain Soul Cage Free Action Frequency once per day; Effect The lich taps into its soul cage's power to cast any arcane spell up to the highest level the lich can cast, even if the spell being cast is not one of the lich's prepared spells. The lich's soul cage doesn't need to be present for the lich to use this ability. Paralyzing Touch (arcane, curse, incapacitation, necromancy) A creature damaged by the lich's hand Strike must succeed at a Fortitude save against the lich's spell DC – 4. The creature becomes paralyzed for 1 round on a failure. On a critical failure, the creature is paralyzed permanently, falls prone, and seems dead. A DC 25 Medicine check reveals the victim is alive.

Mask Death Single Action (arcane, transmutation) The lich changes their appearance to look as they did in life. This effect lasts indefinitely, but if the lich takes damage, their rotten flesh beneath becomes visible until this ability is used again. Metamagic Alteration Single Action (concentrate, metamagic) If the lich's next action is to Cast a Spell, they can alter it in one of two ways. Increase the range of that spell by 30 feet (giving it a range of 30 feet if it's a touch spell). Alternatively, the lich can change the area of the spell if the spell has an area and doesn't have a duration. If the spell is a burst with a radius of at least 10 feet, increase the radius by 5 feet. If it is a line or a cone that has an area of 15 feet or smaller, add 10 feet to the area. Pillage Mind Reaction (arcane, divination, mental) Trigger The lich deals damage with their hand Strike; Effect The lich pulls a memory or thought from the target's mind. The lich Recalls Information with a skill of their choice, using the target's bonus with the skill instead of their own. If there's a very specific piece of information the lich hopes to uncover, and the target knows that information, the target can attempt a Will save to keep it secret. On a critical success, the target can give the lich faulty information instead.

On a failure, the lich siphons the soul from the dying creature, storing it in a black mote of energy that orbits the lich's skull. The creature can't be brought back from the dead while its soul is trapped in this way. Once per day, as a single action, the lich can consume a mote to heal a number of Hit Points equal to double the soul's level. This utterly destroys the soul, making the creature impossible to bring back to life without a wish , miracle , or similar magic. The lich can have a number of motes orbiting them equal to their Charisma modifier (to a minimum of one mote); if the lich gains an additional mote, the oldest one is released, its soul free to travel to the afterlife. Unholy Touch The lich's touch is suffused with evil, dealing evil damage instead of negative. On a critical hit, the target also takes persistent evil damage equal to half the lich's level.","type":"Creature Family","url":"/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=68","weakness":{}}},{"_index":"aon18","_id":"creature-family-69","_score":4.166701,"_source":{"breadcrumbs_spa":[],"category":"creature-family","creature_family":"Linnorm","creature_family_markdown":"Linnorm","exclude_from_search":false,"id":"creature-family-69","markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Creature Family\">[Linnorm](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=69)</title>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 224</row>\n\nImmense, primeval dragons of the northern reaches of the world, linnorms hate those they deem to be lesser creatures and seek to inflict as much suffering as possible upon their unfortunate victims.

Members Merfolk Warrior (Creature 1), Merfolk Wavecaller (Creature 2) Merfolk's Secret Some sailors claim that merfolk face a grave threat—a dark and sinister power capable of rendering even the most beautiful merfolk into a degenerate and mutated wretch. Such stories often end with claims that the merfolk, proud and noble as they seem, are unwitting puppets to some unknown entity lurking in the deepest depths of the seas. Merfolk themselves are characteristically tight-lipped about such claims.

The most common of their kind are the dryads, which are spirits that embody great trees, but many other kinds of nymphs exist, including naiads, who watch over bodies of water. All nymphs are guardians of some element of nature, typically a specific tree or pond, or even—in the case of nymph queens—whole forests or massive bodies of water. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Nymph Queens</title> Nymph queens are powerful nymphs that rule over entire regions of untouched wilderness, not just single trees or ponds. Every variety of nymph can have a queen. Naiad queens are among the most prominent, and more often interact with nearby mortals. Thus, some scholars refer to naiad queens as simply “nymphs.” \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Nymph Queen Abilities</title> A nymph queen is 6 to 10 levels higher than an ordinary nymph of the same type, with enhanced numerical statistics and improved Strikes to match. A nymph queen’s ward is a significant region, and she strengthens and vivifies this territory with her presence. Nymph queens are not dependent on their wards and lose the corresponding ability (such as a dryad’s tree dependent ability); instead, they gain the tied to the land ability, as described below. A nymph queen also gains the nymph’s beauty aura and the Focus Beauty action, which have varying effects based on the queen’s original type. She gains the Inspiration ability, allowing her to bestow a gift of inspiration on those who catch her fancy, and the Change Shape ability to change her form. Finally, she gains primal prepared spells as a druid of her level.\n\n **Change Shape** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([polymorph](/Traits.aspx?ID=127), [primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=134), [transmutation](/Traits.aspx?ID=157)) Nymph queens can transform between their original form, which looks much like a typical nymph of their kind, and any Small or Medium humanoid form, typically choosing a more humanoid-looking version of their natural form.<br /> **Focus Beauty** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=134), [visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=163)) The nymph queen focuses her beauty upon a target within her aura. The creature must attempt a Will save. On a failure, it is affected as if by the nymph queen’s nymph’s beauty aura; if it was already affected by the aura, it suffers a greater effect described in the nymph queen’s entry. A nymph queen can Focus Beauty on a given creature only once per turn.<br /> **Inspiration** <actions string=\"Three Actions\" /> ([emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=134)) A nymph queen can inspire a single intelligent creature by giving that creature a token of her favor, typically a lock of her hair. As long as the creature carries her token and remains in good standing with the nymph queen, the creature gains a +1 status bonus to all Crafting checks, Performance checks, and Will saves.<br /> If a nymph queen grants her Inspiration to a bard and the nymph queen is that bard’s muse, the bard gains an additional benefit depending on their muse theme: for lore muse, the bard also gains a +1 status bonus to all Lore checks; for maestro muse, the status bonus to Performance checks increases to +2 for the purpose of determining the effects of compositions; for polymath muse, the bard gains a +4 status bonus to untrained skill checks; and for all other muses, the Will save bonus increases to +2 against fey.<br /> **Nymph’s Beauty** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=134), [visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=163)) 30 feet.

As long as the queen is healthy, the environment is exceptionally resilient, allowing the nymph queen to automatically attempt to counteract spells and rituals such as blight that would harm the environment, using her Spell DC with a counteract level equal to the highest-level druid spell she can cast.

Standing 10 feet tall and densely muscled, ogres are as strong as they are cruel. Ogres are sadists that enjoy remorseless murder, torture, degradation, and mutilation in all of its forms. Although they prefer to vent their violent urges on smaller humanoids— the smaller and more beautiful, the better—ogres promise a horrifying fate for anyone unlucky enough to fall within their meaty grasp. But for all their creativity in developing methods of violence, ogres often remain too dim-witted to realize that their playthings lack an ogre’s robust fortitude and high pain tolerance, so most captives die far sooner than the ogres might prefer. Such a fate is perhaps preferable however, as those who survive too long as ogres’ playthings suffer lasting mental scars from the horrifying abuse. A captive able to keep their wits can sometimes trick the brutes by promising treasure, meatier captives, or other crude amusements, taking advantage of an ogre’s limited intellect to engineer opportunities to escape.\n\n Ogres are social creatures only in the most debased sense. They gather together in groups called families, though members are not always related by blood. Ogres practice incest regularly, believing that it makes for stronger familial bonds, and most ogres are misshapen or mutated from generations of inbreeding. The most powerful ogre in any family is the “boss”—usually the family’s patriarch or matriarch—while other ogres in the family learn to obey or risk being brutalized by the boss’s loyal kin. Ogres lair in caves, crumbling ruins, or dilapidated shacks close enough to humanoid settlements or animal trails to make raiding easy.

Standing 10 feet tall and densely muscled, ogres are as strong as they are cruel. Ogres are sadists that enjoy remorseless murder, torture, degradation, and mutilation in all of its forms. Although they prefer to vent their violent urges on smaller humanoids— the smaller and more beautiful, the better—ogres promise a horrifying fate for anyone unlucky enough to fall within their meaty grasp. But for all their creativity in developing methods of violence, ogres often remain too dim-witted to realize that their playthings lack an ogre’s robust fortitude and high pain tolerance, so most captives die far sooner than the ogres might prefer. Such a fate is perhaps preferable however, as those who survive too long as ogres’ playthings suffer lasting mental scars from the horrifying abuse. A captive able to keep their wits can sometimes trick the brutes by promising treasure, meatier captives, or other crude amusements, taking advantage of an ogre’s limited intellect to engineer opportunities to escape. Ogres are social creatures only in the most debased sense. They gather together in groups called families, though members are not always related by blood. Ogres practice incest regularly, believing that it makes for stronger familial bonds, and most ogres are misshapen or mutated from generations of inbreeding. The most powerful ogre in any family is the “boss”—usually the family’s patriarch or matriarch—while other ogres in the family learn to obey or risk being brutalized by the boss’s loyal kin. Ogres lair in caves, crumbling ruins, or dilapidated shacks close enough to humanoid settlements or animal trails to make raiding easy.

The most powerful proteans are demigods known collectively as the protean lords, although they are mysterious entities whose cults on the Material Plane tend to be obscure and secretive.\n\n Proteans divide themselves into a loose caste system and possess a dizzying variety of powers. Most proteans have a serpentine body with the head of a primeval beast. Scholars have long been intrigued by this fact—that scions of dissolution and disorder would share so many features—pointing out that even in the purest chaos there is some semblance of order. Others note that the serpentine form is one of the most primeval shapes, perhaps suggesting that in a reality at the dawn of time, such shapes were all that could exist. The proteans themselves have little to say on the matter, which, perhaps ironically, only adds to the confusion and lack of consensus surrounding their kind. After all, if even chaos cannot be trusted to be chaotic, would that not be the purest form of entropy? \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Warpwaves</title> Many proteans can subject their foes to disorienting alterations perceived in time and space by creating ripples of unstable reality in the environment called warpwaves.

To proteans, there is no purer form of existence than entropy, and they constantly seek to oppose the establishment of order in the Great Beyond.

The most powerful proteans are demigods known collectively as the protean lords, although they are mysterious entities whose cults on the Material Plane tend to be obscure and secretive. Proteans divide themselves into a loose caste system and possess a dizzying variety of powers. Most proteans have a serpentine body with the head of a primeval beast. Scholars have long been intrigued by this fact—that scions of dissolution and disorder would share so many features—pointing out that even in the purest chaos there is some semblance of order. Others note that the serpentine form is one of the most primeval shapes, perhaps suggesting that in a reality at the dawn of time, such shapes were all that could exist. The proteans themselves have little to say on the matter, which, perhaps ironically, only adds to the confusion and lack of consensus surrounding their kind. After all, if even chaos cannot be trusted to be chaotic, would that not be the purest form of entropy? Warpwaves Many proteans can subject their foes to disorienting alterations perceived in time and space by creating ripples of unstable reality in the environment called warpwaves. When a creature fails its saving throw and is affected by a warpwave, roll 1d8 and consult the table below for the specific effect on that creature. Unless indicated otherwise, a warpwave effect lasts for 1d4 rounds, and a new warpwave effect negates any previous warpwave effect already affecting a creature. D8 Warpwave Effect 1 Clumsy 2 (3 on a critical failure) 2 Confused and gains 4d6 temporary Hit Points 3 Dazzled (permanent on a critical failure) 4 Enfeebled 2 (3 on a critical failure) 5 Immobilized by filaments of energy 6 Quickened (Stride, Strike, or Step only) 7 Slowed 1 8 Stupefied 2 (3 on a critical failure) Members Akizendri (Creature 3), Azuretzi (Creature 5), Hegessik (Creature 15), Imentesh (Creature 10), Izfiitar (Creature 20), Keketar (Creature 17), Naunet (Creature 7), Voidworm (Creature 1) Ancient Immortals Among the numerous types of immortals that dwell in the Great Beyond, the proteans are surely some of the oldest. They’ve waged war against the inevitable aeons from the advent of their first creation, and speak longingly of that time before the gods themselves imposed order upon reality. Born from Chaos The Maelstrom, home of all proteans, is the whirling mass of turbulent primal energy, planar waves, and soul-stuff that surrounds the Outer Planes. Planar scholars theorize that all of reality was originally formed from the Maelstrom in the early days of the cosmos—a theory proteans don’t necessarily dispute. Defending Chaos Where proteans go, chaos follows. To proteans, there is no purer form of existence than entropy, and they constantly seek to oppose the establishment of order in the Great Beyond. However, proteans don’t see life as being incompatible with chaos; rather, they simply believe beings—immortal or not—deserve complete freedom on their own terms. Other Proteans Many other proteans beyond those presented here dwell in the Maelstrom, including the spectral pelagastrs, the nearly humanoid shapechanging ourdivars, and the incredibly powerful izfiitars. Protean Divinities The most powerful of all proteans are a group of demigods known collectively as protean lords.

These arachnids are so feared and dangerous that in many cultures, they are treated as deities or dualistic symbols of both death and protection from said death. Members Black Scorpion (Creature 15), Cave Scorpion (Creature 1), Giant Scorpion (Creature 3), Scorpion Swarm (Creature 4) Scorpion Venom While scorpions are often symbols of death or evil, their venom can be extracted and used for a wide variety of medical applications. A character can milk an incapacitated giant scorpion to extract raw scorpion venom, which can be used as raw materials to craft giant scorpion venom or lesser antiplague. To determine the value of ingredients you gain each day and the DC of the appropriate Medicine or Lore check, use the level 3 task entry in Table 4–2: Income Earned. The Desert Rider Those rescued from death in the burning sands often recount the same dying vision: a strange, silver-eyed woman whose scarlet silk tents stand on the back of a colossal black scorpion, riding out of a shattered city and leading an army of the dead across a sea of glass toward the world of the living. Millennium-old paintings on the walls of rediscovered tombs depict a similar desert rider. The identity of this red-robed woman is unknown.

Bearing only a vague resemblance to the humanoids from whose flesh they were formed, sinspawn generally appear horrifically emaciated and have unnaturally long arms and digitigrade legs, each with a trio of stubby, taloned digits. Veins bulge across sinspawn’s bodies in sanguine patterns that suspiciously resemble twisted runes, and their flesh is pale and hairless. Their heads are elongated, bearing only slits for a nose, red eyes, and disturbing lower jaws that split in half at the chin, revealing pedipalps that end in tiny, three-fingered hands and framing a long, lolling tongue. Sinspawn stand 6-1/2 feet tall and typically weigh as much as an emaciated human of their size.

If you give a skeleton more, you might want to increase its level and adjust its statistics. \n\n### Bestiary\n **Bloody** The skeleton is covered in dripping blood and gains [fast healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=15) equal to its level. \n\n **Collapse** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> **Trigger** The skeleton is critically hit. **Effect** The skeleton collapses into a pile of bones and the attack deals only normal damage. The skeleton can reform in a standing position as an action, but until it does, it is [immobilized](/Conditions.aspx?ID=24) and [flat-footed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=16).\n\n **Explosive Death** When the skeleton is destroyed, its bones shatter and explode as the necromantic energy holding it together is released. Adjacent creatures take 1d6 slashing damage per 2 levels (minimum 1d6) with a [basic](/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Reflex save.\n\n **Screaming Skull** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([auditory](/Traits.aspx?ID=16), [emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=68), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) The skeleton removes its skull and throws it, making a jaws attack with a range of 20 feet. It then attempts to [Demoralize](/Actions.aspx?ID=53) each foe within 10 feet of the target. The head bounces, rolls, or even flies back, returning to the skeleton at the start of its next turn. The skeleton is [blind](/Conditions.aspx?ID=1) until then. \n\n### Bestiary 3\n **Blaze** The skeleton is wreathed with fire, which doesn't consume its bones or gear. The skeleton gains immunity to [fire](/Traits.aspx?ID=72) and weakness 5 to cold, loses its resistance to [cold](/Traits.aspx?ID=27), and its Strikes deal additional [persistent fire damage](/Conditions.aspx?ID=29) equal to half the skeleton's level (minimum 1 damage).<br /> <br /> **Bone Missile** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> The skeleton yanks a rib from its ribcage to use as an arrow or javelin. The skeleton loses HP equal to its level (minimum 1), then makes a ranged Strike. This uses the attack bonus of whichever of the skeleton's other Strikes has the highest attack bonus and deals piercing damage equal to that Strike's damage plus the skeleton's level (minimum 1).\n\n **Bone Powder** **Source** When the skeleton takes physical damage from a critical hit, one of its bones is pulverized into a fine powder. All creatures in a 5-foot emanation that breathe take 1d6 [persistent poison damage](/Conditions.aspx?ID=29) (plus an additional 1d6 for every 6 levels the skeleton has). \n\n **Skeleton of Roses**  Thick briars have grown through the skeleton's bones, covering it in red roses with inch-long thorns. The skeleton's unarmed melee Strikes deal additional piercing damage equal to 1/3 the skeleton's level (minimum 1 damage). At the end of each of its turns, if the skeleton has caused piercing damage with its thorns, it regains HP equal to its level (minimum 1). Each time the skeleton regains HP in this way, another rose blossoms. \n\n### Book of the Dead\n**Aquatic Bones** The skeleton has bones from aquatic creatures, allowing it to swim using a simple tail, paddles, or similar appendage. The skeleton has a swim Speed of 20 feet and gains the [aquatic](/Traits.aspx?ID=168) trait and the [aquatic ambush](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=2) ability.\n\n **Bone Storm** <actions string=\"Three Actions\" /> **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The skeleton transforms into a cyclone of bones, taking up the same space, but twice as tall. It then Strides up to double its Speed. It can move through spaces occupied by other creatures, and this movement doesn't trigger reactions. Creatures the bone storm moves through take 1d6 slashing damage for every 2 levels of the skeleton, with a [basic](/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Reflex save against the [hard DC for the creature's level](/Rules.aspx?ID=554). A level 1 or lower skeleton only moves; it doesn't deal damage. A creature attempts this save only once even if the bone storm moved through its space multiple times. At the end of the movement, the skeleton reforms.\n\n **Crumbling Bones** The skeleton is made from crumbling bones that drift in clouds of dust. The skeleton has a fly Speed of 20 but it must end its turn within no more than 5 feet off the ground, or it falls, taking damage as normal. In addition, the skeleton can move through any space that's large enough for its skull to fit through.\n\n **Frozen** The skeleton's bones are covered in a thin layer of ice. The skeleton gains immunity to [cold](/Traits.aspx?ID=27) and weakness 5 to [fire](/Traits.aspx?ID=72) and loses resistance to fire. The skeleton is surrounded by an aura of cold that deals cold damage equal to half the skeleton's level to all adjacent creatures at the start of the skeleton's turn ([basic](/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Reflex save with a [standard DC for its level](/Rules.aspx?ID=554)).\n\n **Grave Eruption** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> **Requirements** The skeleton is [undetected](/Conditions.aspx?ID=39) and buried in dirt, gravel, or other loose material; **Effect** The skeleton erupts from the ground, Stands, and makes a melee Strike. The target is [flat-footed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=16) against this Strike. If the Strike hits, the target is [frightened 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=19) (or frightened 2 on a critical hit).\n\n **Lacquered** During the process to create the skeleton, it was covered with several layers of an alchemical lacquer, giving its bones a golden hue and granting added protection. The skeleton gains [acid](/Traits.aspx?ID=3) resistance 5 and a +2 status bonus to saves against effects that age or erode the target.\n\n **Nimble** The skeleton is particularly fast and nimble. Its land Speed increases by 10 feet and it has a climb Speed of 20 feet. In addition, it gains the [Nimble Dodge](/Feats.aspx?ID=550) reaction.\n\n **Rotten** The bones of this skeleton are black and rotten, having spent years in polluted water or some other foul substance. The skeleton loses its resistance to piercing and slashing damage and is surrounded by a horrific stench in a 10-foot aura. A creature entering or starting its turn in the aura must succeed at a Fortitude save against the [standard DC of the skeleton's level](/Rules.aspx?ID=554) or become [sickened 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=34) (plus [slowed 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=35) for as long as it remains sickened on a critical failure). While within the aura, affected creatures take a –2 circumstance penalty to saves against [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46) and to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune for 1 minute.<br /> This stench remains for 1 hour after the rotten skeleton has been destroyed unless the bones are burned, or the rot is washed away with at least 1 gallon of water.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Beetle Carapace](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1902) (Creature 6), [Drake Skeleton](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1903) (Creature 8), [Harpy Skeleton](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1298) (Creature 5), [Skeletal Champion](/Monsters.aspx?ID=373) (Creature 2), [Skeletal Giant](/Monsters.aspx?ID=375) (Creature 3), [Skeletal Horse](/Monsters.aspx?ID=374) (Creature 2), [Skeletal Hulk](/Monsters.aspx?ID=376) (Creature 7), [Skeletal Mage](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1901) (Creature 5), [Skeletal Soldier](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1900) (Creature 1), [Skeletal Titan](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1904) (Creature 13), [Skeleton Guard](/Monsters.aspx?ID=372) (Creature -1), [Skeleton Infantry](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1300) (Creature 11), [Tyrannosaurus Skeleton](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1299) (Creature 9), [Wolf Skeleton](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1899) (Creature 0)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Creating Skeletons</title>\r\n\r\nStart with a skeleton of the appropriate size.

Skeleton Abilities Most skeletons have one of these abilities. If you give a skeleton more, you might want to increase its level and adjust its statistics. ### Bestiary Bloody The skeleton is covered in dripping blood and gains fast healing equal to its level. Collapse Reaction Trigger The skeleton is critically hit. Effect The skeleton collapses into a pile of bones and the attack deals only normal damage. The skeleton can reform in a standing position as an action, but until it does, it is immobilized and flat-footed. Explosive Death When the skeleton is destroyed, its bones shatter and explode as the necromantic energy holding it together is released. Adjacent creatures take 1d6 slashing damage per 2 levels (minimum 1d6) with a basic Reflex save. Screaming Skull Two Actions (auditory, emotion, fear, mental) The skeleton removes its skull and throws it, making a jaws attack with a range of 20 feet. It then attempts to Demoralize each foe within 10 feet of the target. The head bounces, rolls, or even flies back, returning to the skeleton at the start of its next turn. The skeleton is blind until then. ### Bestiary 3 Blaze The skeleton is wreathed with fire, which doesn't consume its bones or gear. The skeleton gains immunity to fire and weakness 5 to cold, loses its resistance to cold, and its Strikes deal additional persistent fire damage equal to half the skeleton's level (minimum 1 damage). Bone Missile Two Actions The skeleton yanks a rib from its ribcage to use as an arrow or javelin. The skeleton loses HP equal to its level (minimum 1), then makes a ranged Strike. This uses the attack bonus of whichever of the skeleton's other Strikes has the highest attack bonus and deals piercing damage equal to that Strike's damage plus the skeleton's level (minimum 1). Bone Powder Source When the skeleton takes physical damage from a critical hit, one of its bones is pulverized into a fine powder. All creatures in a 5-foot emanation that breathe take 1d6 persistent poison damage (plus an additional 1d6 for every 6 levels the skeleton has). Skeleton of Roses Thick briars have grown through the skeleton's bones, covering it in red roses with inch-long thorns. The skeleton's unarmed melee Strikes deal additional piercing damage equal to 1/3 the skeleton's level (minimum 1 damage). At the end of each of its turns, if the skeleton has caused piercing damage with its thorns, it regains HP equal to its level (minimum 1). Each time the skeleton regains HP in this way, another rose blossoms. ### Book of the Dead Aquatic Bones The skeleton has bones from aquatic creatures, allowing it to swim using a simple tail, paddles, or similar appendage. The skeleton has a swim Speed of 20 feet and gains the aquatic trait and the aquatic ambush ability. Bone Storm Three Actions Frequency once per day; Effect The skeleton transforms into a cyclone of bones, taking up the same space, but twice as tall. It then Strides up to double its Speed.

The skeleton is surrounded by an aura of cold that deals cold damage equal to half the skeleton's level to all adjacent creatures at the start of the skeleton's turn (basic Reflex save with a standard DC for its level). Grave Eruption Two Actions Requirements The skeleton is undetected and buried in dirt, gravel, or other loose material; Effect The skeleton erupts from the ground, Stands, and makes a melee Strike. The target is flat-footed against this Strike. If the Strike hits, the target is frightened 1 (or frightened 2 on a critical hit). Lacquered During the process to create the skeleton, it was covered with several layers of an alchemical lacquer, giving its bones a golden hue and granting added protection. The skeleton gains acid resistance 5 and a +2 status bonus to saves against effects that age or erode the target. Nimble The skeleton is particularly fast and nimble.

When you need to create a vampire for your game, you can do so in two ways. In most cases, it’s more effective to build the vampire from the ground up, using the standard rules for monster creation (this is how the vampire count, vampire spawn, and vampire mastermind presented on these pages were built). Or you can use the guidelines presented under Creating a Vampire to turn an existing creature (or even a player character!) into a vampire, adjusting the monster as you see fit. In either case, specific vampire abilities like coffin restoration, Mist Escape, and Drink Blood work the same.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Non-Evil Vampires</title>\r\n\r\nNon-evil vampires are rare and at odds with their basic nature.

Other types of vampires include the withered nosferatu, the hopping jiang shi, and the psychic vetala—these vampires share many of the basic traits with moroi but possess new abilities of their own. [Dhampir](/Monsters.aspx?ID=116) can be born of any of these vampire races, though moroi-born dhampir known as svetochers are the most common, especially in the Inner Sea region.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature Family Group\">Vampire</title>\r\n\r\n**Related Families**\r\n[Vampire, Jiang-Shi](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=286), [Vampire, Nosferatu](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=273), [Vampire, Strigoi](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=314), [Vampire, Vetalarana](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=311), [Vampire, Vrykolakas](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=159)\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Creating a Vampire</title>\r\n\r\nYou can turn an existing living creature into a vampire using the following steps.\n\n Increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. \n<ul><li>It gains the [undead](/Traits.aspx?ID=160) and [vampire](/Traits.aspx?ID=242) traits, and usually becomes evil.</li> <li>Increase AC, attack bonuses, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1.</li> <li>Increase damage with Strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. If an ability can be used only a small number of times (such as a dragon's breath weapon), increase the damage by 2 instead.</li> <li>Reduce HP by the amount listed on the table.</li> <li>The vampire gains [fast healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=15) and resistance to physical damage (except [silver](/Equipment.aspx?ID=379)) as indicated in the table. These abilities are the reason the vampire has less HP.</li></ul>\n<table><tr><td>Starting Level</td><td>HP Decrease</td><td>Fast Healing/Resistance</td></tr> <tr><td>3–4</td><td>–20</td><td>5</td></tr> <tr><td>5–7</td><td>–30</td><td>7</td></tr> <tr><td>8–14</td><td>–40</td><td>10</td></tr> <tr><td>15+</td><td>–60</td><td>15</td></tr></table>\n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Basic Vampire Abilities</title> All vampires gain the following abilities. If the base creature has any abilities that specifically come from it being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as [human](/Traits.aspx?ID=90) and [humanoid](/Traits.aspx?ID=91). You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the vampire's theme.\n\n**[Negative Healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=42)**\n\n **Immunities** [death](/Traits.aspx?ID=40) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), [paralyze](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126), [sleep](/Traits.aspx?ID=145)\n\n **Coffin Restoration** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117), [negative](/Traits.aspx?ID=118)) Unlike other undead, a vampire isn't destroyed at 0 HP. Instead, it falls [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38). If its body rests in its coffin for 1 hour, the vampire gains 1 HP, after which its fast healing begins to function normally.\n\n **Vampire Weaknesses** All vampires possess the following weaknesses.\n<ul><li>**Compulsions** Vampires are creatures of strange and unknowable compulsions. A typical vampire can't voluntarily cross running water unless it is transported while it hides within its coffin, nor can it enter a private dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. At your discretion, vampires might have different compulsions—a pirate vampire might not be able to set foot on solid ground without being invited, for example. The vampire can still be forced to do these things and might be able to overcome its compulsion just as it does its revulsion (see below).</li> <li>**Revulsion** A vampire can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a brandished religious symbol of a non-evil deity. To brandish garlic or a religious symbol, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to [Raising a Shield](/Actions.aspx?ID=98)). If the vampire involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of its revulsion, it gains the [fleeing](/Conditions.aspx?ID=17) condition, running from the object of its revulsion until it ends an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of its revulsion, a vampire can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the [concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32) trait. On a success, it overcomes its revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success).</li> <li>**Stake** A wooden stake driven through a vampire's heart drops the vampire to 0 HP and prevents it from healing above 0 HP, even in its coffin. Staking a vampire requires three actions and works only if the vampire is [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38). If the stake is removed, the vampire can heal above 0 HP again, and if it's in its coffin the 1-hour rest period begins once the stake is removed. If the vampire's head is severed and anointed with holy water while the stake is in place, the vampire is destroyed.</li> <li>**Sunlight** If exposed to direct sunlight, a vampire immediately becomes [slowed 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=35). The slowed value increases by 1 each time the vampire ends its turn in sunlight. If the vampire loses all its actions in this way, it is destroyed. Due to their supernatural aversion to light, vampires don't cast shadows or show a reflection in mirrors.</li></ul>**Climb Speed** Vampires gain a climb Speed equal to their land Speed.<br /> **Claws** If the creature had hands, its fingernails thicken and grow, granting it an unarmed claw Strike that deals slashing damage and has the [agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170) trait. If the monster had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by its claws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If it had only non-agile attacks, its claws should deal three-quarters that damage.<br /> **Drink Blood** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)); **Requirement** A [grabbed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=20), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [restrained](/Conditions.aspx?ID=33), [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38), or willing creature is within the vampire's reach. **Effect** The vampire sinks its fangs into that creature to drink its blood. This requires an [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is [drained 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=10) and the vampire regains HP equal to 10% of its maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire but increases the victim's drain value by 1. A vampire can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but it gains no HP from doing so.<br /> A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a DC 20 [Medicine](/Skills.aspx?ID=9) check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drain by 1 after 10 minutes.<br /> **Grab** The creature's claw attacks (or equivalent unarmed attacks) gain [Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=18).\n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">True Vampire Abilities</title> Powerful vampires that can create and control vampires from their victims gain additional vampire abilities, as detailed below. A creature below level 5 is not a significant enough creature to become a true vampire—you should instead simply make such a creature into a regular vampire spawn, or rebuild the creature so that it's at least level 5 before becoming a true vampire.\n\n**Resistances** The vampire resists all physical damage except [magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103) silver.\n\n **Create Spawn** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [downtime](/Traits.aspx?ID=49), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) If a creature dies after being reduced to 0 HP by Drink Blood, the vampire can turn this victim into a vampire by donating some of its own blood to the victim and burying the victim in earth for 3 nights. If the new vampire is lower level than its creator, it is under the creator's control. If a vampire controls too many spawn at once (as determined by the GM), strong-willed spawn can free themselves by succeeding at a Will saving throw against the vampire's Will DC.\n\n **Mist Escape** <actions string=\"Free Action\" /> **Trigger** The vampire is reduced to 0 HP. **Effect** The vampire uses Turn to Mist. It can take move actions to move toward its coffin even though it's at 0 HP. While at 0 HP in this form, the vampire is unaffected by further damage. It automatically returns to its corporeal form, unconscious, if it reaches its coffin or after 2 hours, whichever comes first.\n\n **Change Shape** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [polymorph](/Traits.aspx?ID=127), [transmutation](/Traits.aspx?ID=157)) The vampire transforms into one of its animal forms or back into its normal form. Most vampires can turn into a bat, but some can turn into a different creature, such as a rat or a wolf. Use the options in the [_aerial form_](/Spells.aspx?ID=4) and [_animal form_](/Spells.aspx?ID=10) spells as guidelines.\n<ul><li>**Bat** The vampire changes into a bat swarm or giant bat. It gains echolocation 40 feet, a land Speed of 20 feet and a fly Speed of 30 feet, and a fangs Strike with the same attack bonus as its highest melee attack. These fangs deal the same amount of damage as the vampire's claws, but deal piercing damage rather than slashing damage.</li></ul>**Children of the Night** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) The vampire's presence brings forth creatures of the night to do the master's bidding. These typically include [rat swarms](/Monsters.aspx?ID=347), [bat swarms](/Monsters.aspx?ID=45), and [wolves](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=101), but can include other creatures. The vampire can give telepathic orders to these creatures as long as they are within 100 feet, but they can't communicate back.\n\n **Dominate** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61), [incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=93), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=163)) The vampire can cast [_dominate_](/Spells.aspx?ID=87) at will as a divine innate spell. Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the [visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=163) trait. The save DC uses the DC of the vampire's level, and a creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that vampire's Dominate for 24 hours.

When you need to create a vampire for your game, you can do so in two ways. In most cases, it’s more effective to build the vampire from the ground up, using the standard rules for monster creation (this is how the vampire count, vampire spawn, and vampire mastermind presented on these pages were built). Or you can use the guidelines presented under Creating a Vampire to turn an existing creature (or even a player character!) into a vampire, adjusting the monster as you see fit. In either case, specific vampire abilities like coffin restoration, Mist Escape, and Drink Blood work the same. Non-Evil Vampires Non-evil vampires are rare and at odds with their basic nature. Such vampires typically give up a fraction of their power in exchange for some of their lost humanity. Vampire and Dhampir The most common and traditional vampires, as presented here, are known also as the “moroi.” They are prevalent in Golarion in the mist-shrouded counties of Ustalav and found in small numbers in almost every nation of the Inner Sea. Other types of vampires include the withered nosferatu, the hopping jiang shi, and the psychic vetala—these vampires share many of the basic traits with moroi but possess new abilities of their own. Dhampir can be born of any of these vampire races, though moroi-born dhampir known as svetochers are the most common, especially in the Inner Sea region. Vampire Related Families Vampire, Jiang-Shi, Vampire, Nosferatu, Vampire, Strigoi, Vampire, Vetalarana, Vampire, Vrykolakas Creating a Vampire You can turn an existing living creature into a vampire using the following steps. Increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. It gains the undead and vampire traits, and usually becomes evil. Increase AC, attack bonuses, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1. Increase damage with Strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. If an ability can be used only a small number of times (such as a dragon's breath weapon), increase the damage by 2 instead. Reduce HP by the amount listed on the table. The vampire gains fast healing and resistance to physical damage (except silver) as indicated in the table. These abilities are the reason the vampire has less HP. Starting Level HP Decrease Fast Healing/Resistance 3–4 –20 5 5–7 –30 7 8–14 –40 10 15+ –60 15 Basic Vampire Abilities All vampires gain the following abilities. If the base creature has any abilities that specifically come from it being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as human and humanoid. You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the vampire's theme. Negative Healing Immunities death effects, disease, paralyze, poison, sleep Coffin Restoration (divine, necromancy, negative) Unlike other undead, a vampire isn't destroyed at 0 HP. Instead, it falls unconscious. If its body rests in its coffin for 1 hour, the vampire gains 1 HP, after which its fast healing begins to function normally. Vampire Weaknesses All vampires possess the following weaknesses. Compulsions Vampires are creatures of strange and unknowable compulsions. A typical vampire can't voluntarily cross running water unless it is transported while it hides within its coffin, nor can it enter a private dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. At your discretion, vampires might have different compulsions—a pirate vampire might not be able to set foot on solid ground without being invited, for example. The vampire can still be forced to do these things and might be able to overcome its compulsion just as it does its revulsion (see below). Revulsion A vampire can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a brandished religious symbol of a non-evil deity. To brandish garlic or a religious symbol, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the vampire involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of its revulsion, it gains the fleeing condition, running from the object of its revulsion until it ends an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of its revulsion, a vampire can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, it overcomes its revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success). Stake A wooden stake driven through a vampire's heart drops the vampire to 0 HP and prevents it from healing above 0 HP, even in its coffin. Staking a vampire requires three actions and works only if the vampire is unconscious. If the stake is removed, the vampire can heal above 0 HP again, and if it's in its coffin the 1-hour rest period begins once the stake is removed. If the vampire's head is severed and anointed with holy water while the stake is in place, the vampire is destroyed. Sunlight If exposed to direct sunlight, a vampire immediately becomes slowed 1. The slowed value increases by 1 each time the vampire ends its turn in sunlight. If the vampire loses all its actions in this way, it is destroyed. Due to their supernatural aversion to light, vampires don't cast shadows or show a reflection in mirrors. Climb Speed Vampires gain a climb Speed equal to their land Speed. Claws If the creature had hands, its fingernails thicken and grow, granting it an unarmed claw Strike that deals slashing damage and has the agile trait. If the monster had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by its claws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If it had only non-agile attacks, its claws should deal three-quarters that damage. Drink Blood Single Action (divine, necromancy); Requirement A grabbed, paralyzed, restrained, unconscious, or willing creature is within the vampire's reach. Effect The vampire sinks its fangs into that creature to drink its blood. This requires an Athletics check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is drained 1 and the vampire regains HP equal to 10% of its maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire but increases the victim's drain value by 1. A vampire can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but it gains no HP from doing so. A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drain by 1 after 10 minutes. Grab The creature's claw attacks (or equivalent unarmed attacks) gain Grab. True Vampire Abilities Powerful vampires that can create and control vampires from their victims gain additional vampire abilities, as detailed below. A creature below level 5 is not a significant enough creature to become a true vampire—you should instead simply make such a creature into a regular vampire spawn, or rebuild the creature so that it's at least level 5 before becoming a true vampire. Resistances The vampire resists all physical damage except magical silver. Create Spawn (divine, downtime, necromancy) If a creature dies after being reduced to 0 HP by Drink Blood, the vampire can turn this victim into a vampire by donating some of its own blood to the victim and burying the victim in earth for 3 nights. If the new vampire is lower level than its creator, it is under the creator's control. If a vampire controls too many spawn at once (as determined by the GM), strong-willed spawn can free themselves by succeeding at a Will saving throw against the vampire's Will DC. Mist Escape Free Action Trigger The vampire is reduced to 0 HP. Effect The vampire uses Turn to Mist. It can take move actions to move toward its coffin even though it's at 0 HP. While at 0 HP in this form, the vampire is unaffected by further damage. It automatically returns to its corporeal form, unconscious, if it reaches its coffin or after 2 hours, whichever comes first. Change Shape Single Action (concentrate, divine, polymorph, transmutation) The vampire transforms into one of its animal forms or back into its normal form. Most vampires can turn into a bat, but some can turn into a different creature, such as a rat or a wolf. Use the options in the aerial form and animal form spells as guidelines. Bat The vampire changes into a bat swarm or giant bat. It gains echolocation 40 feet, a land Speed of 20 feet and a fly Speed of 30 feet, and a fangs Strike with the same attack bonus as its highest melee attack. These fangs deal the same amount of damage as the vampire's claws, but deal piercing damage rather than slashing damage. Children of the Night (divine, enchantment, mental) The vampire's presence brings forth creatures of the night to do the master's bidding. These typically include rat swarms, bat swarms, and wolves, but can include other creatures. The vampire can give telepathic orders to these creatures as long as they are within 100 feet, but they can't communicate back. Dominate Two Actions (divine, enchantment, incapacitation, mental, visual) The vampire can cast dominate at will as a divine innate spell. Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the visual trait. The save DC uses the DC of the vampire's level, and a creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that vampire's Dominate for 24 hours. Fully destroying the vampire ends the domination, but merely reducing the vampire to 0 HP is insufficient to break the spell. Drink Blood As a typical vampire, but the victim is drained 2 instead of 1. Turn to Mist Single Action (concentrate, divine, transmutation) The vampire turns into a cloud of vapor, as the gaseous form spell, or back to its normal form. The vampire loses fast healing while in gaseous form. The vampire can remain in this form indefinitely.","type":"Creature Family","url":"/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=97","weakness":{}}},{"_index":"aon18","_id":"creature-family-98","_score":4.166701,"_source":{"breadcrumbs_spa":[],"category":"creature-family","creature_family":"Warg","creature_family_markdown":"Warg","exclude_from_search":false,"id":"creature-family-98","markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Creature Family\">[Warg](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=98)</title>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 322</row>\n\nThe warg is an intelligent and malevolent wolf that dwells among goblins, hobgoblins, orcs, and other violent humanoids.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Warg](/Monsters.aspx?ID=402) (Creature 2), [Winter Wolf](/Monsters.aspx?ID=403) (Creature 5)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Warg Legends</title>\r\n\r\nWargs are the subject of many grim tales and campfire stories.

When you need to create a werecreature for your game, you can do so in one of two ways. You can simply build the werecreature from the ground up, using the standard rules for monster creation (this is how the werebear, wererat, and werewolf presented on these pages were built). Or you can use the guidelines presented under “Creating Werecreatures” to turn an existing creature (or even a player character!) into a werecreature.

Nevertheless, the word has gained traction in certain circles, and as a result it's not uncommon to hear the whispers of locals who fear lycanthropes even when a ravenous [weretiger](/Monsters.aspx?ID=858) is the real threat.

Each shape has a specific, persistent appearance. A true werecreature's natural form is its hybrid shape. In humanoid shape, the werecreature uses its original humanoid size, loses its jaws and claws Strikes, and gains a melee fist Strike that deals bludgeoning damage equal to the slashing damage dealt by its claw.

Members Werebat (Creature 2), Werebear (Creature 4), Wereboar (Creature 2), Werecrocodile (Creature 2), Wererat (Creature 2), Weretiger (Creature 4), Werewolf (Creature 3) Group Families Werecreature, Werecreature, Wereant Building Werecreatures The curse of the werecreature comes in myriad forms and can affect any humanoid, allowing you to make a wide variety of werecreatures for your adventures. When you need to create a werecreature for your game, you can do so in one of two ways. You can simply build the werecreature from the ground up, using the standard rules for monster creation (this is how the werebear, wererat, and werewolf presented on these pages were built). Or you can use the guidelines presented under “Creating Werecreatures” to turn an existing creature (or even a player character!) into a werecreature. In either case, specific werecreature abilities like Change Shape, curse of the werecreature, and moon frenzy work the same. Lycanthropy Many scholars refer to the curse of the werecreature as “lycanthropy,” but technically this is correct only when speaking of werewolves. Nevertheless, the word has gained traction in certain circles, and as a result it's not uncommon to hear the whispers of locals who fear lycanthropes even when a ravenous weretiger is the real threat. Naturally, the werecreatures themselves don't take this ignorance lightly, and tend to see being equated with a werewolf as a great insult. Unless, of course, the werecreature is a werewolf! Other Werecreatures In theory, any animal could form the basis for a new type of werecreature, provided the animal in question is at least omnivorous—herbivorous werecreatures are all but unheard of. Werecreatures that rise from insects, arachnids, and similar invertebrate animals are particularly unsettling, though much rarer than werecreatures of vertebrate animals. Retaining Humanity Werecreatures are notorious for their murderous rampages in the deep of the night—violence that is often at odds with the afflicted’s true nature. Even an honorable town guard or priest could be a murderous werewolf without realizing it, for the werecreature’s curse leaves the afflicted with no memory of their nocturnal murder sprees. Wolfsbane Wolfsbane is a poisonous plant that can cure the curse of the werecreature. It’s effective only if consumed before the creature transforms for the first time. If the creature survives wolfsbane’s effects without using magic to aid in surviving, the creature can attempt a new saving throw against the curse of the werecreature. On a success, the creature is cured. Werecreature Related Families Werecreature, Wereant Creating Werecreatures You can turn an existing, living humanoid into a werecreature by completing the following steps. (These changes reflect a werecreature in its hybrid form.) Increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. It gains the beast and werecreature traits, and its alignment is usually adjusted to match that of its werecreature type. Increase its size by one category if the animal is a larger size than the base humanoid. Increase its AC, attack bonuses, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1. Increase its damage with Strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. If the werecreature is limited in how often it can use an ability (such as a breath weapon), increase the damage by 2 instead. Increase its HP by the amount shown on the table. This HP increase is more than typical in order to compensate for the creature's weakness to silver. The creature gains weakness to silver as shown on the table. Starting Level HP Increase Weakness to Silver 4 or lower +25 5 5–7 +35 7 8–14 +50 10 15+ +75 15 Werecreature Abilities All werecreatures gain the following abilities, some of which match an ability of the animal the werecreature transforms into. You might also need to adjust some abilities that conflict with the theme of the werecreature (such as abilities with a conflicting alignment trait). Senses The werecreature gains all the senses of the animal. Animal Empathy (divination, primal) A werecreature can communicate with animals of the same general kind. Claws The werecreature gains a claw Strike (an agile unarmed attack that deals slashing damage). If it had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by its claws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If it had only non-agile attacks, its claws should deal three-quarters that damage. Jaws The creature gains a jaws Strike (an unarmed attack that deals piercing damage) that inflicts its curse of the werecreature. If it had any non-agile attacks, the damage dealt by its jaws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If it had only agile attacks, its jaws should deal one-third more damage. Change Shape Single Action (concentrate, polymorph, primal, transmutation) The werecreature changes into its humanoid, hybrid, or animal shape. Each shape has a specific, persistent appearance. A true werecreature's natural form is its hybrid shape. In humanoid shape, the werecreature uses its original humanoid size, loses its jaws and claws Strikes, and gains a melee fist Strike that deals bludgeoning damage equal to the slashing damage dealt by its claw. In animal shape, its Speed and size change to that of the animal, it gains any special Strike effects of the animal that it didn't already have (such as Grab), and it loses its weapon Strikes. Curse of the Werecreature (curse, necromancy, primal) This curse affects only humanoids. Saving Throw Fortitude DC is the standard DC for the werecreature's new level – 1. On each full moon, the cursed creature must succeed at another Fortitude save or turn into the same kind of werecreature until dawn. The creature is under the GM's control and goes on a rampage for half the night before falling unconscious until dawn. Moon Frenzy (polymorph, primal, transmutation) When a full moon appears in the night sky, the werecreature must enter hybrid form, can't Change Shape thereafter, becomes one size larger, increases its reach by 5 feet, and increases the damage of its jaws Strike (or a similar Strike) by 2. When the moon sets or the sun rises, the werecreature returns to humanoid form and is fatigued for 2d4 hours.","type":"Creature Family","url":"/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=100","weakness":{}}},{"_index":"aon18","_id":"creature-family-101","_score":4.166701,"_source":{"breadcrumbs_spa":[],"category":"creature-family","creature_family":"Wolf","creature_family_markdown":"Wolf","exclude_from_search":false,"id":"creature-family-101","markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Creature Family\">[Wolf](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=101)</title>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 334</row>\n\nWolves roam forests, hills, and other wild lands, where they hunt in packs to beleaguer and surround their prey before going in for the kill.

Unthinking and ever-shambling harbingers of death, zombies stop only when they're destroyed. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Zombie Abilities</title> You can modify zombies with the following zombie abilities. Most zombies have one of these abilities; If you give a zombie more, you might want to increase its level and adjust its statistics. The DCs use the zombie's level from the [Spell DC and Spell Attack Bonus](/Rules.aspx?ID=1020) table.<br /> **Disgusting Pustules** ([disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) The zombie is covered in pustules that rupture when it takes any piercing damage or any critical hit. In either case, adjacent creatures are hit with vile fluid, causing them to become sickened 1 unless they succeed at a Fortitude save.<br /> **Feast** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([manipulate](/Traits.aspx?ID=104)) If the zombie is adjacent to a helpless or unconscious creature, or a deceased creature that died in the past hour, the zombie can feast upon its flesh to heal itself. This restores an amount of Hit Points equal to the zombie's level. If the creature is alive, the zombie deals damage equal to its jaws, flst, or claw damage.<br /> **Plague-Ridden** ([disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) The zombie carries a plague that can create more of its own kind. This functions as the plague zombie's zombie rot, except at stage 5, the victim rises as another of the zombie's type, rather than a plague zombie.<br /> **Rotting Aura** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) The zombie emits an aura of rot and disease that causes wounds to fester and turn sour. Any living creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the zombie and is not at full Hit Points takes 1d6 damage as its wounds fester. This damage increases by 1d6 for every 6 levels the zombie has. Creatures that take a critical hit from the zombie also take this damage immediately.<br /> **Unkillable** This zombie is nigh unkillable. The zombie loses its weakness to slashing and gains resistance against all damage equal to its level (minimum 3), and it gains weakness equal to twice its level (minimum 6) to critical hits. Increase the zombie's level by 1 if you give it this ability. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Additional Monster Abilities</title>\n\n### Bestiary 3\nYou can modify zombies with the following zombie abilities, in addition to those found on page 340 of the _Bestiary_. Most zombies have one of these abilities; if you give a zombie more, you might want to increase its level and adjust its statistics. \n\n**Ankle Biter** This zombie fights just as well on the ground as it does standing. While [prone](/Conditions.aspx?ID=31), the zombie isn't [flat-footed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=16), it ignores the status penalty to its attack rolls, and it gains a +2 circumstance bonus to [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) checks to [Trip](/Actions.aspx?ID=40). The zombie can also move up to half its Speed when it [Crawls](/Actions.aspx?ID=76). \n\n**Persistent Limbs** The first time the zombie is critically hit with a melee or ranged Strike, a limb falls off its body and continues to attack. The limb acts on the zombie's initiative; each round it can Stride up to half the zombie's Speed and make a Strike. The limb uses and contributes to the zombie's multiple attack penalty. \n\n**Putrid Stench** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [olfactory](/Traits.aspx?ID=246)) 15 feet. The zombie's rotting flesh is particularly malodorous. A creature that enters the area must attempt a Fortitude save. On a failure, the creature is [sickened 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=34), and on a critical failure, the creature also takes a –5-foot status penalty to its Speeds for 1 round. While within the aura, the creature takes a –2 circumstance penalty to saves to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune to all zombies' putrid stenches for 1 minute. \n\n**Unholy Speed** The zombie gains a +10 status bonus to all its Speeds\n\n### Book of the Dead\n **Infested** The zombie's flesh is infested with swarming vermin. When the zombie is hit with a critical hit or destroyed, the [swarm](/Traits.aspx?ID=239) is set free. Its initiative is immediately after the zombie's. If the swarm is 4 or more levels lower than the zombie, it isn't worth XP (and doesn't add its XP to the encounter budget).\n\n **Spitting Zombie** The zombie spits acid as a ranged Strike with a range of 30 feet. This uses the highest attack bonus among the zombie's Strikes and deals 1d12 acid damage per 3 levels of the zombie (or 1d6 acid damage below level 3). On a critical hit, the target also takes 1d4 [persistent acid damage](/Conditions.aspx?ID=29) per 3 levels of the zombie. Once used, the zombie must spend 1 action to cough up enough acid to use this ability again.\n\n **Tearing Grapple** The zombies work in groups to rip foes to pieces. Whenever a zombie with this ability successfully [Grapples](/Actions.aspx?ID=35) a foe that's already [grabbed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=20) or [restrained](/Conditions.aspx?ID=33) by another zombie with this ability, they violently struggle over the poor victim, dealing fist damage (or a similar Strike's damage if the zombie doesn't have a fist Strike). If the grapple is a critical success, the target takes double damage and ceases being grabbed or restrained by any other creatures. If the zombie has the [Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=18) ability, using Grab deals half its fist Strike damage to the target.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Dirge Piper](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2036) (Creature 3), [Husk Zombie](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1919) (Creature 2), [Plague Zombie](/Monsters.aspx?ID=424) (Creature 1), [Shambler Troop](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1376) (Creature 4), [Shock Zombie](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1985) (Creature 6), [Sulfur Zombie](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1377) (Creature 6), [Withered](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1922) (Creature 5), [Zombie Brute](/Monsters.aspx?ID=425) (Creature 2), [Zombie Dragon](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1378) (Creature 9), [Zombie Hulk](/Monsters.aspx?ID=426) (Creature 6), [Zombie Lord](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1921) (Creature 4), [Zombie Mammoth](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1923) (Creature 11), [Zombie Owlbear](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1920) (Creature 3), [Zombie Shambler](/Monsters.aspx?ID=423) (Creature -1), [Zombie Snake](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1918) (Creature 0)\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Group Families</title>\r\n[Zombie](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=103), [Zombie, Tar](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=303)\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Creating Zombies</title>\r\n\r\nTo create a zombie creature, start with a zombie of the appropriate size.

Unthinking and ever-shambling harbingers of death, zombies stop only when they're destroyed. Zombie Abilities You can modify zombies with the following zombie abilities. Most zombies have one of these abilities; If you give a zombie more, you might want to increase its level and adjust its statistics. The DCs use the zombie's level from the Spell DC and Spell Attack Bonus table. Disgusting Pustules (disease, necromancy) The zombie is covered in pustules that rupture when it takes any piercing damage or any critical hit. In either case, adjacent creatures are hit with vile fluid, causing them to become sickened 1 unless they succeed at a Fortitude save. Feast Two Actions (manipulate) If the zombie is adjacent to a helpless or unconscious creature, or a deceased creature that died in the past hour, the zombie can feast upon its flesh to heal itself. This restores an amount of Hit Points equal to the zombie's level. If the creature is alive, the zombie deals damage equal to its jaws, flst, or claw damage. Plague-Ridden (disease, necromancy) The zombie carries a plague that can create more of its own kind. This functions as the plague zombie's zombie rot, except at stage 5, the victim rises as another of the zombie's type, rather than a plague zombie. Rotting Aura (aura, disease, necromancy) The zombie emits an aura of rot and disease that causes wounds to fester and turn sour. Any living creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the zombie and is not at full Hit Points takes 1d6 damage as its wounds fester. This damage increases by 1d6 for every 6 levels the zombie has. Creatures that take a critical hit from the zombie also take this damage immediately. Unkillable This zombie is nigh unkillable. The zombie loses its weakness to slashing and gains resistance against all damage equal to its level (minimum 3), and it gains weakness equal to twice its level (minimum 6) to critical hits. Increase the zombie's level by 1 if you give it this ability. Additional Monster Abilities ### Bestiary 3\nYou can modify zombies with the following zombie abilities, in addition to those found on page 340 of the Bestiary . Most zombies have one of these abilities; if you give a zombie more, you might want to increase its level and adjust its statistics. Ankle Biter This zombie fights just as well on the ground as it does standing. While prone, the zombie isn't flat-footed, it ignores the status penalty to its attack rolls, and it gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks to Trip. The zombie can also move up to half its Speed when it Crawls. Persistent Limbs The first time the zombie is critically hit with a melee or ranged Strike, a limb falls off its body and continues to attack. The limb acts on the zombie's initiative; each round it can Stride up to half the zombie's Speed and make a Strike. The limb uses and contributes to the zombie's multiple attack penalty. Putrid Stench (aura, olfactory) 15 feet. The zombie's rotting flesh is particularly malodorous. A creature that enters the area must attempt a Fortitude save. On a failure, the creature is sickened 1, and on a critical failure, the creature also takes a –5-foot status penalty to its Speeds for 1 round. While within the aura, the creature takes a –2 circumstance penalty to saves to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune to all zombies' putrid stenches for 1 minute. Unholy Speed The zombie gains a +10 status bonus to all its Speeds ### Book of the Dead Infested The zombie's flesh is infested with swarming vermin. When the zombie is hit with a critical hit or destroyed, the swarm is set free. Its initiative is immediately after the zombie's. If the swarm is 4 or more levels lower than the zombie, it isn't worth XP (and doesn't add its XP to the encounter budget). Spitting Zombie The zombie spits acid as a ranged Strike with a range of 30 feet. This uses the highest attack bonus among the zombie's Strikes and deals 1d12 acid damage per 3 levels of the zombie (or 1d6 acid damage below level 3). On a critical hit, the target also takes 1d4 persistent acid damage per 3 levels of the zombie. Once used, the zombie must spend 1 action to cough up enough acid to use this ability again. Tearing Grapple The zombies work in groups to rip foes to pieces. Whenever a zombie with this ability successfully Grapples a foe that's already grabbed or restrained by another zombie with this ability, they violently struggle over the poor victim, dealing fist damage (or a similar Strike's damage if the zombie doesn't have a fist Strike). If the grapple is a critical success, the target takes double damage and ceases being grabbed or restrained by any other creatures. If the zombie has the Grab ability, using Grab deals half its fist Strike damage to the target.

Then add any Strikes, Speeds, or other abilities it would gain from its shape. To create a Gargantuan zombie, begin with the zombie hulk, apply the elite adjustments, change its size to Gargantuan, and increase its reach by 5 feet. Disposable Legions With the ancient lich Tar-Baphon now released from his ages-long imprisonment, the undead within his legions have been specifically repurposed. Zombies like the ones seen here fulfill particular roles, and evil necromancers deploy them much like living or intelligent undead troops. Necromancer experiments seek to produce various abilities and mix energies, with horrifying results that doesn't deter their creators. Hoarding Instincts Though zombies have no use for wealth—indeed, most don't understand the concept in the first place—zombie dragons retain a hint of their innate tendency to hoard. A fresher corpse might guard the hoard it gathered in life (or what remains of it), while a zombie further from life might instead hoard bones, rocks, corpses, or other unusual objects. Understandably, the monetary value of these hoards varies widely Mindless Mix-Ups Zombies try to obey orders, but understanding the words spoken doesn't always mean interpreting them correctly. Examples of misunderstood orders have included the following. “Fetch my hat,” leading the zombie to spend hours throwing a hat across a room and retrieving it. “Prune these bushes,” resulting in bushes “pruned” entirely, cut off at the root. “Let me know if anyone comes to the door,” causing the zombie to go to the door and return to its master. “Kill the intruders!” turning zombies raised from a local graveyard against their master, who was not from the area. Risen from the Grave Zombies are often created using unwholesome necromantic rituals. Among the living dead, zombies are most often used as fodder, wearing down defenses and consuming resources before more powerful undead arrive to deal the killing blow. Zombies cannot speak or really even think for themselves, but they can be commanded by other allied undead and powerful necromancers. Symphony of Flesh Life creates flesh to fulfill its needs, growing it to hunt, consume, and survive. In undeath, the tools of survival can be made into a medium for art. The zombie is the first note in a symphony of dead flesh. Along with skeletons, they are the sturdy, reliable base of any masterpiece and an artist who fails to master these simple tools is not worth notice. One can hear the joyous sounds of the symphony in the low moans and creaking bones of a zombie legion. Zombie Animals Animals, like the snake, owlbear, and mammoth found here, can easily turn into zombies. They commonly rise from areas cursed by necromancy rather than being deliberately created. Risen pets sometimes develop a fondness for zombies, especially zombies of their former owners. An ordinary zombie can be a suitable companion, capable of petting the risen pet endlessly without the capacity to grow bored.

Shoony societies on Kortos are known for their agricultural prowess, industrious work ethic, and skill with tools to shape their environment.\n\n Shoonies have a rich oral history and claim that their kind flourished all around Kortos in the days when the living god Aroden walked among them. Many shoonies believe that Aroden himself personally created the shoonies after he raised the island from the bottom of the sea, and that he had a deep affinity for their people. Whether or not such tales of companionship with the god of humanity are true, shoonies have drastically declined in numbers since Aroden’s death over a hundred years ago. Shoony elders point to strange environmental phenomena around their island home as one cause of their diminishment, and others attribute their decline to the rise of warmongering monsters in the area.

Shoony societies on Kortos are known for their agricultural prowess, industrious work ethic, and skill with tools to shape their environment. Shoonies have a rich oral history and claim that their kind flourished all around Kortos in the days when the living god Aroden walked among them. Many shoonies believe that Aroden himself personally created the shoonies after he raised the island from the bottom of the sea, and that he had a deep affinity for their people. Whether or not such tales of companionship with the god of humanity are true, shoonies have drastically declined in numbers since Aroden’s death over a hundred years ago. Shoony elders point to strange environmental phenomena around their island home as one cause of their diminishment, and others attribute their decline to the rise of warmongering monsters in the area. In a world where might often makes right, it is hardly a surprise that the peaceful but timid shoonies are becoming increasingly rare. Members Shoony Hierarch (Creature 4), Shoony Militia Member (Creature 2), Shoony Tiller (Creature 0) Resources Shoonies typically lack the resources to smelt and forge metal tools, weapons, and armor in any major capacity. Instead, they trade with other peoples for these precious resources. Farming, fishing, and hunting tools made of metal are especially vital to the shoony way of life, so shoony clans maintain good relations with any other clans or villages willing to trade with them. In exchange, shoony crops and animals grown for food make for reliable trade offerings, though the exchange rate is such that a shoony clan might acquire only one metal tool in a poor growing season. Shoony Crops While many shoony settlements rely on staple crops such as barley and beans, talented shoony farmers rarely settle for such mundane produce. Rumors speak of fiddlehead ferns that increase the speed of one’s gait, cabbages that fortify against toxins, and carrots that grant improved vision. Because shoonies alone know the secret to cultivating such wondrous vegetables, and because such veggies still rot and expire like mundane produce, finding these rare foodstuffs outside the Isle of Kortos is practically impossible.

Some spirits are created as guardians instead, tasked as protectors of elements of nature that cannot protect themselves. When these spirits accept their divine place in the metacosmos and take on such charges, they become [kami](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=243). But some of these spirits are willful, obstinate, or simply rotten, railing against such demands from the gods and becoming bodiless and unable to interact with the world they can torturously still observe. Others receive such punishment simply for failing at their duty, and their despair at their condition twists them like those that began with a seed of darkness. When these spirits look upon mortal lives and become overcome with envy of the flesh and pleasure that humanoids can revel in, they form surrogate bodies of their own and become monsters known collectively as oni.\n\n When an oni manifests, they always do so in a form that parodies a specific humanoid ancestry closely associated with the oni's obsessions and envies. Giants' over-the-top personalities and sizes are likely the reason why these humanoids are the most common incarnations chosen by oni; such oni are known collectively as yai oni. Yet there exist oni associated with almost every kind of humanoid. Most oni are capable of supernaturally disguising themselves as their associated humanoid type and use this ability to infiltrate societies and seize control from within. Once established, oni typically reveal their true form and revel in dominating those they view as lesser beings fit only to serve their whims.\n\n Oni are nothing if not vain. They typically choose comely or striking appearances in their humanoid disguises—forms that are completely at odds with the ugliness of their true natures. An oni's true form is indicative of their innermost desires and always has features such as oversized teeth that verge into tusks, sharp claws, unusually bright skin colors, or a third eye in the forehead. Oni have desires as varied as those of any being, though by their nature these desires are almost always for hedonistic or destructive experiences of the flesh, typically food, pleasure, or violence.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Fire Yai](/Monsters.aspx?ID=748) (Creature 14), [Ice Yai](/Monsters.aspx?ID=747) (Creature 13), [Onidoshi](/Monsters.aspx?ID=746) (Creature 8), [Shadow Yai](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1404) (Creature 16), [Taiga Yai](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1405) (Creature 15), [Water Yai](/Monsters.aspx?ID=749) (Creature 17)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Oni Daimyo</title>\r\n\r\nOni daimyo are quasi-deities with isolated mortal domains.

But some of these spirits are willful, obstinate, or simply rotten, railing against such demands from the gods and becoming bodiless and unable to interact with the world they can torturously still observe. Others receive such punishment simply for failing at their duty, and their despair at their condition twists them like those that began with a seed of darkness. When these spirits look upon mortal lives and become overcome with envy of the flesh and pleasure that humanoids can revel in, they form surrogate bodies of their own and become monsters known collectively as oni. When an oni manifests, they always do so in a form that parodies a specific humanoid ancestry closely associated with the oni's obsessions and envies. Giants' over-the-top personalities and sizes are likely the reason why these humanoids are the most common incarnations chosen by oni; such oni are known collectively as yai oni. Yet there exist oni associated with almost every kind of humanoid. Most oni are capable of supernaturally disguising themselves as their associated humanoid type and use this ability to infiltrate societies and seize control from within. Once established, oni typically reveal their true form and revel in dominating those they view as lesser beings fit only to serve their whims. Oni are nothing if not vain. They typically choose comely or striking appearances in their humanoid disguises—forms that are completely at odds with the ugliness of their true natures. An oni's true form is indicative of their innermost desires and always has features such as oversized teeth that verge into tusks, sharp claws, unusually bright skin colors, or a third eye in the forehead. Oni have desires as varied as those of any being, though by their nature these desires are almost always for hedonistic or destructive experiences of the flesh, typically food, pleasure, or violence. Members Fire Yai (Creature 14), Ice Yai (Creature 13), Onidoshi (Creature 8), Shadow Yai (Creature 16), Taiga Yai (Creature 15), Water Yai (Creature 17) Oni Daimyo Oni daimyo are quasi-deities with isolated mortal domains. The most powerful is Inma, the Empress of the World, but Akuma the Horned King, Murona the Dark Mother, and Nataka the Red King are also worshipped. Oni Origins The first oni originated in the nation of Minkai on the continent of Tian Xia. Whether due to prevalent local kami— particularly in the mist-shrouded Forest of Spirits—or its peoples' faiths, Minkai is a hotbed of oni activity. Oni Shapechangers Oni humanoid forms are limited to one specific appearance. An ogre mage can assume only one specific ogre form, while an ice yai can appear only as one specific frost giant. Some oni have greater control over their shapeshifting power and can assume the form of any humanoid creature, and these oni tend to be the most dangerous. Other Oni Different oni exist for nearly every humanoid ancestry. Kuwa oni mask their golden skin and four-fingered claws in human form, while ja oni hide as hobgoblins. Other yai include wind yai (who take their form from cloud giants) and the immensely powerful void yai (who form from other yai and ascend to rule over rune giants).

While many do so on the blades or under the spells of dragonslayers, some manage to outlast their enemies and must, in time, face the truth that awaits all living creatures at the end of their natural lifespan. As with many other creatures, some dragons respond to such looming reminders of their own mortality poorly, and the particularly prideful or wrathful of their kind often lash out in anger when confronted by this grim truth. Peace and acceptance may find some dragons, but the most stubborn of their ilk (and invariably the most wicked) may pursue a different answer to the problem. These dragons seek out sinister rites that can transform them into undead creatures known as raveners.\n\n A ravener’s flesh is stripped away as part of the transformation, leaving only their skeleton. What they lose in flesh, however, the dragon gains in soul-rending power, as their raw spiritual energy forms a protective barrier around their skeleton, keeping it intact and allowing flight with now-skeletal wings. This new existence is not so easy to maintain as other forms of undeath, however, and the ravener must feed regularly on the souls of living creatures to power their profane metabolism. This hunger is much greater than that of a living dragon, so raveners are forced to relocate regularly, traveling to fresh hunting grounds each time they strip their current home of prey. A ravener may depopulate whole regions at a time in order to sate their endless hunger for souls, lest they lose much of their power and become a ravener husk.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Ravener](/Monsters.aspx?ID=783) (Creature 21), [Ravener Husk](/Monsters.aspx?ID=784) (Creature 14)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_3_Locations.png\">Ravener Lairs</title>\r\n\r\nCunning and paranoid, raveners prefer to make their lairs in places hostile to mortal life: atop peaks so high that living creatures struggle to breathe the rarefied air, submerged beneath pools of magma in the caldera of an active volcano, and so on. Some raveners even go so far as to deliberately fill their entire lair with lethally poisonous gases, and raveners that are capable of advanced spellcasting often seal their lairs completely, accessing them exclusively by spells such as [_teleport_](/Spells.aspx?ID=338) or [_gaseous form_](/Spells.aspx?ID=129).

This typically means that if the original dragon had two spells prepared of its highest level, you should add one more spell of that level and then two spells of the next highest level, while if it had three spells prepared of its highest level, you would add three spells of the next highest level (if applicable, add only a single 10th-level spell). Either way, increase its cantrip level by 1.\n\n If the ravener is unusually young, you might be able to use spells from the relevant spellcasting dragon sidebar, but for a typical ancient dragon, consider the following spells to fill in the new slots, depending on which level of spells you need. \n<ul><li>**10th** [_wish_](/Spells.aspx?ID=377)</li><li>**9th** [_power word kill_](/Spells.aspx?ID=227), [_telepathic demand_](/Spells.aspx?ID=336), [_weird_](/Spells.aspx?ID=375)</li><li>**8th** [_disappearance_](/Spells.aspx?ID=73), [_maze_](/Spells.aspx?ID=187), [_mind blank_](/Spells.aspx?ID=192)</li><li>**7th** [_contingency_](/Spells.aspx?ID=49), [_energy aegis_](/Spells.aspx?ID=100), [_spell turning_](/Spells.aspx?ID=297)</li></ul>\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_5_TreasureAndRewards.png\">Ravener Treasure</title>\r\n\r\nBecause they change lairs more often than living dragons, raveners prefer treasure that is compact and easily transported.

Typically, the dragon must perform a rare ritual called [_ravenous reanimation_](/Rituals.aspx?ID=26), but this requirement can be waived if the prospective ravener has the aid of a powerful patron. In certain unique conditions, such as the intervention of a vile god of undeath, a dragon can transform into a ravener after death without the use of this rite at all. A ravener is a powerful creature that is likely to have a major impact on your game, so you might want to create each one as a custom monster. If you don't have time, you can also create a ravener via the following steps. Increase the dragon's level by 2 and change their statistics as follows. \n<ul><li>They gain the undead trait and the Necril language. </li><li>Increase their AC, attack bonuses, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 2. </li><li>They gain weakness to good damage and more HP (see below). </li><li>The ravener's melee strikes deal an additional 2d6 negative damage, and their damaging Breath Weapon deals an additional 4d6 persistent negative damage.</li></ul> \n\n## Ravener\n<row gap=\"tiny\">\n<table> <tr><td>**Starting Level**</td><td>**HP Increase**</td><td>**Weakness**</td></tr> <tr><td>13-20</td><td>50</td><td>15</td></tr> <tr><td>21 or greater</td><td>90</td><td>20</td></tr> </table></row> \n\n### Ravener Abilities \n A ravener gains the following abilities. \n\n[**Darkvision**](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12) \n\n**Soulsense** A ravener senses the spiritual essence of living and undead creatures within the listed range. Creatures whose material bodies are one unit with their souls, like [celestials](/Traits.aspx?ID=23) and [fiends](/Traits.aspx?ID=70), appear brighter to this sense. \n\n**[Negative Healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=42)** \n\n**Immunities** death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, unconscious \n\n**Cowering Fear** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=68), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) A ravener's [frightful presence](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=17) causes creatures to cower in fear as well. As long as a creature is at least [frightened 2](/Conditions.aspx?ID=19) or more as a result of the ravener's frightful presence, it is also [immobilized](/Conditions.aspx?ID=24) from the fear. \n\n**Soul Ward** An intangible field of necromantic energy protects a ravener from total destruction. A soul ward has 150 maximum Hit Points, or 200 if the ravener is level 21 or higher. Whenever a ravener would be reduced below 1 Hit Point, all damage in excess of what would reduce them to 1 Hit Point is instead dealt to their soul ward. If this damage reduces the soul ward to fewer than 0 Hit Points, the ravener is destroyed. A soul ward's Hit Points can be restored only via specific ravener abilities such as Consume Soul, ravenous breath, or vicious criticals. A ravener who goes more than a week without successfully using Consume Soul to feed on a dying creature starves, and their soul ward loses 1d4 Hit Points each day until they feed. If the ravener's soul ward loses all its Hit Points while the ravener still has more than 1 HP, they become a ravener husk. \n\n**Consume Soul** <actions string=\"Free Action\" /> ([death](/Traits.aspx?ID=40), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) **Trigger** A living creature within 30 feet of the ravener dies; **Effect** The ravener tears the creature's soul from its body with their maw and gulps it down. The dying creature must attempt a DC 44 Fortitude save.\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.<br />\n**Success** The ravener tears off a small chunk of the creature’s soul. If the victim is restored to life, they are [drained 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=10) in addition to any other side effects of returning to life. The ravener adds a number of Hit Points to their soul ward equal to half the creature’s level.<br />\n**Failure** As success, but the creature’s soul is ravaged. The creature is drained 3 and the ravener adds a number of Hit Points to their soul ward equal to the creature’s level.<br />\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the ravener devours the entire soul. The victim can’t be restored to life as long as the ravener exists except via a 10th-level effect such as [_miracle_](/Spells.aspx?ID=196) or [_wish_](/Spells.aspx?ID=377), and the ravener adds a number of Hit Points to their soul ward equal to twice the creature’s level.\n\n**Discorporate** <actions string=\"Free Action\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) **Trigger** The ravener takes excess damage to their soul ward but still has at least 51 Hit Points in their soul ward; **Effect** The ravener draws deeply into their soul ward, discorporating their body into soul energy in order to escape. They take 50 damage to their soul ward and their physical body vanishes, reappearing 1d4 hours later in a random location within 1 mile from the location where they used Discorporate. \n\n**Ravenous Breath** A ravener's Breath Weapon is infused with negative energy and strips life essence from the victims. Any creature that fails its save against the ravener's Breath Weapon is drained 1 (or drained 2 on a critical failure). If at least one creature is drained by the ravener's Breath Weapon, the ravener's soul ward gains 5 Hit Points. \n\n**Vicious Criticals** The ravener treats an attack roll as a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, as long as the attack roll was a success. Additionally, whenever the ravener makes a critical hit with one of their Strikes, the target must succeed on a Fortitude save or gain the [drained 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=10) condition. If the target already has a drained value of greater than 0, their drained value instead increases by 1, to a maximum of drained 4. Whenever the ravener applies drain to a creature in this way, their soul ward gains 5 Hit Points.","name":"Ravener","rarity":"common","release_date":"2020-05-27","resistance":{},"search_markdown":"<additional-info>\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 222 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nThough their lifespans can measure in millennia, all dragons must eventually perish.

While many do so on the blades or under the spells of dragonslayers, some manage to outlast their enemies and must, in time, face the truth that awaits all living creatures at the end of their natural lifespan. As with many other creatures, some dragons respond to such looming reminders of their own mortality poorly, and the particularly prideful or wrathful of their kind often lash out in anger when confronted by this grim truth. Peace and acceptance may find some dragons, but the most stubborn of their ilk (and invariably the most wicked) may pursue a different answer to the problem. These dragons seek out sinister rites that can transform them into undead creatures known as raveners. A ravener’s flesh is stripped away as part of the transformation, leaving only their skeleton. What they lose in flesh, however, the dragon gains in soul-rending power, as their raw spiritual energy forms a protective barrier around their skeleton, keeping it intact and allowing flight with now-skeletal wings. This new existence is not so easy to maintain as other forms of undeath, however, and the ravener must feed regularly on the souls of living creatures to power their profane metabolism. This hunger is much greater than that of a living dragon, so raveners are forced to relocate regularly, traveling to fresh hunting grounds each time they strip their current home of prey. A ravener may depopulate whole regions at a time in order to sate their endless hunger for souls, lest they lose much of their power and become a ravener husk. Members Ravener (Creature 21), Ravener Husk (Creature 14) Ravener Lairs Cunning and paranoid, raveners prefer to make their lairs in places hostile to mortal life: atop peaks so high that living creatures struggle to breathe the rarefied air, submerged beneath pools of magma in the caldera of an active volcano, and so on. Some raveners even go so far as to deliberately fill their entire lair with lethally poisonous gases, and raveners that are capable of advanced spellcasting often seal their lairs completely, accessing them exclusively by spells such as teleport or gaseous form . Of course, raveners must feed on the living to persist, so they never locate their lairs so far from sources of life that they'll starve. Ravener Minions Raveners view most undead creatures with little more respect than they have for living creatures, but they often make use of them as servants. They prefer incorporeal undead such as ghosts, specters, and wraiths over such crude and simple minions as skeletons and zombies. Ravener Patrons While most dragons are too prideful to turn to anyone, even the gods, for help, a few who seek to become raveners are so desperate to stave off death that they might turn to powerful patrons for aid, such as demon lords, evil deities, or powerful necromancers, offering service in exchange for their transformation. Ravener Spellcasters Instead of gaining the vicious criticals ability, a ravener spellcaster gains additional spellcasting prowess. When creating your own ravener spellcaster, give it the spellcasting ability of a spellcaster roughly 2 levels higher than a normal spellcasting dragon of its kind. This typically means that if the original dragon had two spells prepared of its highest level, you should add one more spell of that level and then two spells of the next highest level, while if it had three spells prepared of its highest level, you would add three spells of the next highest level (if applicable, add only a single 10th-level spell).

Negative Healing Immunities death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, unconscious Cowering Fear (aura, emotion, fear, mental) A ravener's frightful presence causes creatures to cower in fear as well. As long as a creature is at least frightened 2 or more as a result of the ravener's frightful presence, it is also immobilized from the fear. Soul Ward An intangible field of necromantic energy protects a ravener from total destruction. A soul ward has 150 maximum Hit Points, or 200 if the ravener is level 21 or higher. Whenever a ravener would be reduced below 1 Hit Point, all damage in excess of what would reduce them to 1 Hit Point is instead dealt to their soul ward.

A soul ward's Hit Points can be restored only via specific ravener abilities such as Consume Soul, ravenous breath, or vicious criticals. A ravener who goes more than a week without successfully using Consume Soul to feed on a dying creature starves, and their soul ward loses 1d4 Hit Points each day until they feed. If the ravener's soul ward loses all its Hit Points while the ravener still has more than 1 HP, they become a ravener husk. Consume Soul Free Action (death, divine, necromancy) Trigger A living creature within 30 feet of the ravener dies; Effect The ravener tears the creature's soul from its body with their maw and gulps it down.

Few serpentfolk survive today; their power is shattered, their god [Ydersius](/Deities.aspx?ID=211) decapitated (although not quite slain). The cunning, intelligence, and magical abilities of serpentfolk have diminished from their ancient heights, and most are born without these boons. Those serpentfolk who retain their ancestry’s legacy of intelligence and magic are known as zyss, and they look down upon their more numerous kindred with a mix of disdain and shame. They see these offshoots as a curse on their kind, resulting from their god’s decapitation and the pandemonium during the fall of their underground empire, and have dubbed them aapoph, meaning “chaos made flesh.”\n\n Today, the central realm of the Darklands retains the old name of the serpentfolk empire that once dominated this region—Sekamina. This name is also the source of the serpentfolk’s Aklo title, sekmin, which they are often called in ancient texts. Sekamina itself retains very little of the serpentfolk’s legacy, its mantle of rule having passed on to others like [drow](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=37), [ghouls](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=52), [gugs](/Monsters.aspx?ID=252), and [deep gnomes](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=27). Yet in remote reaches of this dangerous realm, the ruins of serpentfolk cities still stand. Within, a great many serpentfolk sleep in torpor in secluded vaults, with only a few cells awake to enact their schemes. In addition, a small number of serpentfolk settlements dot Golarion’s surface, most of them in humid, remote jungles, far-flung islands, or caverns close to the surface. It’s rare for such a settlement to number more than a few dozen serpentfolk. They rely primarily on slaves to build their power bases, to defend them, and to perform essentially all the practical functions of their society. This includes providing food, crafting goods, and tending to the serpentfolk’s every need.\n\n Zyss serpentfolk are megalomaniacal geniuses with dreams of returning to their place of dominance, though modern serpentfolk have few means of accomplishing this goal. Many of their plans hinge on resurrecting Ydersius, their decapitated god. His headless body still thrashes about, mindless, in the Darklands, waiting to be reunited with his lost skull. Serpentfolk numbers are so small that reclaiming their dominance seems a distant dream, especially since their reproduction is slow. Though a parent can birth a dozen young at once, the gestation period lasts up to a decade, and the likelihood that even one will be zyss is low. There’s no telling whether a child will be zyss or aapoph, regardless of parentage. A coveted zyss child is just as likely to arise from aapoph parents as from two zyss, and every serpentfolk colony has someone in charge of sorting the young, identifying the earliest signs of intelligence in them.\n\n Though the number of zyss is small in serpentfolk colonies, bringing in more zyss isn’t necessarily desirable. A serpentfolk conclave with just a few zyss is functional, but one with a large number becomes fractious. Cults and societies form, all pursuing their own passions and politics, with scheming and backstabbing running rampant. A powerful priest may be able to bring other zyss to heel, but many zyss question why a priest should be in charge if their god is dead. Zyss thrive on selfish desires for hedonistic pleasure and adulation. They feel no love for others, even their offspring. Thriving on decadence, they crave receiving expensive gifts, gorging themselves on massive meals, and pursing arts such as music, poetry, or sculpture. Even more academic hobbies, like the study of magic or warfare, take an artistic bent, like carefully designing colorful illusions or memorizing epic poems about renowned wars. Each zyss believes themself to have more refined tastes than their peers.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Aapoph Serpentfolk](/Monsters.aspx?ID=799) (Creature 3), [Bone Prophet](/Monsters.aspx?ID=801) (Creature 8), [Coil Spy](/Monsters.aspx?ID=800) (Creature 4), [Serpentfolk Granitescale](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1627) (Creature 6), [Serpentfolk Venom Caller](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1628) (Creature 7), [Zyss Serpentfolk](/Monsters.aspx?ID=798) (Creature 2)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Evolving Times</title>\r\n\r\nGranitescales are only one type of aapoph variant to arise in surface colonies, but all display intelligence somewhat greater than ordinary aapophs. Zyss serpentfolk are secretly concerned that their grip on their dull-witted aapoph brethren might slip.

Few serpentfolk …","text":" Serpentfolk Source Bestiary 2 pg. 236 2.0 Before their ancient clash with humanity devastated their civilization, serpentfolk were masters of a sprawling underground empire. Few serpentfolk survive today; their power is shattered, their god Ydersius decapitated (although not quite slain). The cunning, intelligence, and magical abilities of serpentfolk have diminished from their ancient heights, and most are born without these boons. Those serpentfolk who retain their ancestry’s legacy of intelligence and magic are known as zyss, and they look down upon their more numerous kindred with a mix of disdain and shame. They see these offshoots as a curse on their kind, resulting from their god’s decapitation and the pandemonium during the fall of their underground empire, and have dubbed them aapoph, meaning “chaos made flesh.” Today, the central realm of the Darklands retains the old name of the serpentfolk empire that once dominated this region—Sekamina. This name is also the source of the serpentfolk’s Aklo title, sekmin, which they are often called in ancient texts. Sekamina itself retains very little of the serpentfolk’s legacy, its mantle of rule having passed on to others like drow, ghouls, gugs, and deep gnomes. Yet in remote reaches of this dangerous realm, the ruins of serpentfolk cities still stand. Within, a great many serpentfolk sleep in torpor in secluded vaults, with only a few cells awake to enact their schemes. In addition, a small number of serpentfolk settlements dot Golarion’s surface, most of them in humid, remote jungles, far-flung islands, or caverns close to the surface. It’s rare for such a settlement to number more than a few dozen serpentfolk. They rely primarily on slaves to build their power bases, to defend them, and to perform essentially all the practical functions of their society. This includes providing food, crafting goods, and tending to the serpentfolk’s every need. Zyss serpentfolk are megalomaniacal geniuses with dreams of returning to their place of dominance, though modern serpentfolk have few means of accomplishing this goal. Many of their plans hinge on resurrecting Ydersius, their decapitated god. His headless body still thrashes about, mindless, in the Darklands, waiting to be reunited with his lost skull. Serpentfolk numbers are so small that reclaiming their dominance seems a distant dream, especially since their reproduction is slow. Though a parent can birth a dozen young at once, the gestation period lasts up to a decade, and the likelihood that even one will be zyss is low. There’s no telling whether a child will be zyss or aapoph, regardless of parentage. A coveted zyss child is just as likely to arise from aapoph parents as from two zyss, and every serpentfolk colony has someone in charge of sorting the young, identifying the earliest signs of intelligence in them. Though the number of zyss is small in serpentfolk colonies, bringing in more zyss isn’t necessarily desirable. A serpentfolk conclave with just a few zyss is functional, but one with a large number becomes fractious. Cults and societies form, all pursuing their own passions and politics, with scheming and backstabbing running rampant. A powerful priest may be able to bring other zyss to heel, but many zyss question why a priest should be in charge if their god is dead. Zyss thrive on selfish desires for hedonistic pleasure and adulation. They feel no love for others, even their offspring. Thriving on decadence, they crave receiving expensive gifts, gorging themselves on massive meals, and pursing arts such as music, poetry, or sculpture. Even more academic hobbies, like the study of magic or warfare, take an artistic bent, like carefully designing colorful illusions or memorizing epic poems about renowned wars. Each zyss believes themself to have more refined tastes than their peers. Members Aapoph Serpentfolk (Creature 3), Bone Prophet (Creature 8), Coil Spy (Creature 4), Serpentfolk Granitescale (Creature 6), Serpentfolk Venom Caller (Creature 7), Zyss Serpentfolk (Creature 2) Evolving Times Granitescales are only one type of aapoph variant to arise in surface colonies, but all display intelligence somewhat greater than ordinary aapophs. Zyss serpentfolk are secretly concerned that their grip on their dull-witted aapoph brethren might slip. A cultural shift has begun to emerge in some colonies where the ruling zyss now assure aapophs they're valuable workers with a purpose to fill, rather than subservient chattel. Magaambyan Victims Zyss serpentfolk of the Mwangi Expanse have recently taken a keen interest in the activities of the Magaambya and its members throughout the region. Some Magaambyans far from the school have gone missing, often after uncharacteristically absconding with magical lore. While they may have been impersonated by serpentfolk, even more worrying is the possibility that the serpentfolk have discovered an arcane means of regaining their former dominance. Serpentfolk Magic Some serpentfolk might have entirely different innate spells. These alternative spells are typically illusions, enchantments, or divinations like dream message , enthrall , glibness , invisibility , mindlink , mind probe , mind reading , mislead , phantom pain , or zealous conviction . Aapoph serpentfolk lack innate spells. the Headless King Ydersius was defeated by an Azlanti heroine named Savith in the era before Earthfall, and now the so-called Headless King's body prowls aimlessly in the Darklands. That the decapitated god's clerics still gain power from worship points to Ydersius's tenacity and continued existence, after a fashion. Those who seek to recover his skull and return it to his body hope that doing so will restore both him and the sekmin civilization to their full power. What Falls Will Rise The war between the humans of ancient Azlant and the serpentfolk of Sekamina waged on for years. The serpentfolk's defeat threw their society into chaos and undermined their conviction that they would continue to rule simply because they had done so for eons. For millennia, serpentfolk have remained in hiding in their underground fortresses, but many feel it is time to rise again!

If the person answers, the vrykolakas then tries to hunt and slay them within 3 days. Others have an affinity for specific types of animals, always preferring to charm or possess them, or have an aversion to others. Unlike a [moroi vampire](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=97), however, for a vrykolakas these habits are merely sadistic games or personal preferences, not mystical compulsions.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature Family Group\">Vampire</title>\r\n\r\n**Related Families**\r\n[Vampire](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=97), [Vampire, Jiang-Shi](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=286), [Vampire, Nosferatu](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=273), [Vampire, Strigoi](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=314), [Vampire, Vetalarana](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=311)\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Creating a Vrykolakas</title>\r\n\r\nYou can turn an existing living creature into a vrykolakas using the following steps. Increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. \n<ul><li>It gains the [undead](/Traits.aspx?ID=160) and [vampire](/Traits.aspx?ID=242) traits, and it becomes evil. </li><li>Increase AC, attack modifiers, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1. </li><li>Increase Speed by 10 feet or to 40 feet, whichever results in a higher Speed. </li><li>Increase damage with Strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. If an ability can be used only a small number of times (such as a dragon's Breath Weapon), increase the damage by 2 instead.</li></ul> \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Basic Vrykolakas Abilities</title> If the base creature becoming a vrykolakas has any abilities that specifically come from it being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as [human](/Traits.aspx?ID=90) and [humanoid](/Traits.aspx?ID=91). You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the vrykolakas' theme. All vrykolakas gain the following abilities. \n\n**[Darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)** \n\n**Swift Tracker** The vrykolakas moves at full Speed while [Tracking](/Actions.aspx?ID=66). \n\n**[Negative Healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=42)** \n\n**Immunities** [death](/Traits.aspx?ID=40) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126), [sleep](/Traits.aspx?ID=145) \n\n**Feral Corruption** <actions string=\"Free Action\" /> ([curse](/Traits.aspx?ID=38), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=93), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117), [possession](/Traits.aspx?ID=129)) **Trigger** The vrykolakas is reduced to 0 Hit Points, and an [animal](/Traits.aspx?ID=9) is within 100 feet; **Effect** Unlike most other undead, a vrykolakas isn't destroyed when it reaches 0 HP. Instead, it attempts to cast its spirit into an animal within 100 feet, which must attempt a Will save (use a high DC for the vrykolakas's level from the [Spell DC and Spell Attack Roll table](/Rules.aspx?ID=1020)). On a failure, the animal is possessed. This has the effects of the [_possession_](/Spells.aspx?ID=225) spell, but it lasts a number of days equal to the vrykolakas's level. This possession can't be [counteracted](/Rules.aspx?ID=371) with magic (though [_remove curse_](/Spells.aspx?ID=250) works against it normally).\n\n If the animal succeeds at its save, the vrykolakas can attempt to possess a different animal within 100 feet. If at any point an animal critically succeeds at its save or no animal is within 100 feet, the vrykolakas fails to possess anything and is destroyed.\n\n A vrykolakas possessing an animal seeks out its burial site (see Burial Site Bound below) immediately, burying itself there. While the vrykolakas is in this state of recovery, its animal host is [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), and beheading it destroys the vrykolakas and kills its host. Removing the curse destroys the vrykolakas and returns the animal to normal. After 1d4 days, if the vrykolakas hasn't been destroyed, the animal dies and the vrykolakas rises in a new body that's identical to its previous one, formed from the animal's remains. \n\n**Vrykolakas Vulnerabilities** Vrykolakas all have the following vulnerabilities. \n<ul><li>**Burial Site Bound** A vrykolakas is bound to the place of its death or interment. It must return to this location once per week and bury itself in the earth for 24 hours, during which time it is paralyzed and can be beheaded. If it is unable to return to this site, it is reduced to 0 Hit Points and attempts to use Feral Corruption; if this host animal can't return to the burial site before the possession effect ends, the vrykolakas is destroyed and the animal host returns to normal. </li><li>**Vulnerable to Decapitation** A vrykolakas that is beheaded can't use its Feral Possession, and a beheaded corpse cannot rise as a vrykolakas.</li></ul>**Climb Speed** A vrykolakas gains a climb Speed equal to one-half its land Speed. \n\n**Claws** If the base creature had hands, it gains an unarmed claw Strike that deals slashing damage and has the [agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170) trait. Use the moderate damage for the creature's level on the [Strike Damage](/Rules.aspx?ID=1018) table. \n\n**Fangs** The teeth of the vrykolakas grow long, sharp, and deadly, granting it a fangs Strike: an unarmed attack that deals piercing damage and enables the use of its Drink Blood ability. Use the high damage for the creature's level on the Strike Damage table. \n\n**Drink Blood** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) **Requirements** The vrykolakas' last action was a successful fangs Strike; **Effect** The vrykolakas sinks its fangs into that creature to drink its blood. This requires an [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) check against the creature's Fortitude DC. On a success, the creature becomes [drained 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=10), and the vrykolakas regains HP equal to 10% of its maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire, but it increases the creature's drained condition value by 1. A vrykolakas can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but it gains no HP from doing so.\n\n The target creature's drained condition value decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful DC 20 [Medicine](/Skills.aspx?ID=9) check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes. \n\n**[Rend](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=30)** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> The vrykolakas gains the Rend action with its claws.\n\n \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Vrykolakas Master Abilities</title> Particularly powerful vrykolakas can create spawn from the bodies of their victims and gain additional abilities, as detailed below. Creatures of 9th level or higher can become a vrykolakas master, while those of 12th level or higher who have survived for centuries might become a vrykolakas ancient. \n\n**Children of the Night** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) The presence of a vrykolakas master inspires savage creatures to crawl forth to do its bidding, including [rat swarms](/Monsters.aspx?ID=347), [warg](/Monsters.aspx?ID=402), [werewolves](/Monsters.aspx?ID=411), and similar creatures. The vrykolakas master can give telepathic orders to these creatures within 100 feet, but they can't communicate back. \n\n**Pestilential Aura** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=202), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) 5 feet. Creatures beginning their turn in the area while the vrykolakas is in its true form are exposed to [bubonic plague](/Diseases.aspx?ID=6). \n\n**Divine Innate Spells** The vrykolakas master can cast [_vampiric touch_](/Spells.aspx?ID=354) (heightened to half its level rounded up) and 3rd-level [fear](/Deities.aspx?ID=110) three times per day each as divine innate spells. It uses a high DC for its level. \n\n**Bubonic Plague** ([disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46)) **Saving Throw** Fortitude (use a high DC for the vrykolakas's level); **Onset** 1 day; **Stage 1** [fatigued](/Conditions.aspx?ID=15) (1 day); **Stage 2** [enfeebled 2](/Conditions.aspx?ID=13) and fatigued (1 day); Stage 3 enfeebled 3, fatigued, and takes 1d6 [persistent bleed damage](/Conditions.aspx?ID=29) every 1d20 minutes (1 day) \n\n**Change Shape** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [polymorph](/Traits.aspx?ID=127), [transmutation](/Traits.aspx?ID=157)) A vrykolakas master can transform into a form resembling the body it had in life, with the effects of [_humanoid form_](/Spells.aspx?ID=153) but with unlimited duration. It loses its fangs and claw Strikes but gains a +2 circumstance bonus to [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) checks to [Impersonate](/Actions.aspx?ID=46) in this form. \n\n**Create Spawn** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [downtime](/Traits.aspx?ID=49), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) If a creature dies after being reduced to 0 HP by Drink Blood, a vrykolakas master can turn this creature into a [vrykolakas spawn](/Monsters.aspx?ID=842) by donating some of its own blood to the creature and burying it in earth for 3 nights. Such vrykolakas spawn are generally [friendly](/Conditions.aspx?ID=18) to the vrykolakas that created them, but they are not under its control and typically wander off on their own rampage within 1d6 days of their creation. **Dominate Animal** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61), [incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=93), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) The vrykolakas can cast [_dominate_](/Spells.aspx?ID=87) at will as a divine innate spell that affects only animals. The save DC is a high DC for the vrykolakas's level, and a creature that succeeds is immune to that vrykolakas's Dominate Animal for 24 hours. Destroying the vrykolakas ends the effect, but reducing it to 0 HP does not. A dominated animal takes a –4 circumstance penalty to saving throws against the vrykolakas's Feral Possession. \n\n**Drink Blood** As a typical vrykolakas, but the creature is drained 2 instead of 1.","name":"Vampire, Vrykolakas","rarity":"common","release_date":"2020-05-27","resistance":{},"search_markdown":"<additional-info>\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 275 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nWicked and vengeful souls denied even the most basic burial rites can rise again as vrykolakas, blood-drinking and plague-bearing reanimated corpses. …\r\n</summary>","source":["Bestiary 2"],"source_raw":["Bestiary 2 pg. 275"],"source_category":"Rulebooks","source_markdown":"<row gap=\"tiny\">[Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 275 <sup>2.0</sup></row>","speed":{},"summary":"Wicked and vengeful souls denied even the most basic burial rites can rise again as vrykolakas, blood-drinking and plague-bearing reanimated corpses. …","summary_markdown":"Wicked and vengeful souls denied even the most basic burial rites can rise again as vrykolakas, blood-drinking and plague-bearing reanimated corpses. …","text":" Vampire, Vrykolakas Source Bestiary 2 pg. 275 2.0 Wicked and vengeful souls denied even the most basic burial rites can rise again as vrykolakas, blood-drinking and plague-bearing reanimated corpses.

Others have an affinity for specific types of animals, always preferring to charm or possess them, or have an aversion to others. Unlike a moroi vampire, however, for a vrykolakas these habits are merely sadistic games or personal preferences, not mystical compulsions. Vampire Related Families Vampire, Vampire, Jiang-Shi, Vampire, Nosferatu, Vampire, Strigoi, Vampire, Vetalarana Creating a Vrykolakas You can turn an existing living creature into a vrykolakas using the following steps. Increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. It gains the undead and vampire traits, and it becomes evil. Increase AC, attack modifiers, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1. Increase Speed by 10 feet or to 40 feet, whichever results in a higher Speed. Increase damage with Strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. If an ability can be used only a small number of times (such as a dragon's Breath Weapon), increase the damage by 2 instead. Basic Vrykolakas Abilities If the base creature becoming a vrykolakas has any abilities that specifically come from it being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as human and humanoid. You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the vrykolakas' theme. All vrykolakas gain the following abilities. Darkvision Swift Tracker The vrykolakas moves at full Speed while Tracking. Negative Healing Immunities death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, sleep Feral Corruption Free Action (curse, divine, incapacitation, mental, necromancy, possession) Trigger The vrykolakas is reduced to 0 Hit Points, and an animal is within 100 feet; Effect Unlike most other undead, a vrykolakas isn't destroyed when it reaches 0 HP. Instead, it attempts to cast its spirit into an animal within 100 feet, which must attempt a Will save (use a high DC for the vrykolakas's level from the Spell DC and Spell Attack Roll table). On a failure, the animal is possessed. This has the effects of the possession spell, but it lasts a number of days equal to the vrykolakas's level. This possession can't be counteracted with magic (though remove curse works against it normally). If the animal succeeds at its save, the vrykolakas can attempt to possess a different animal within 100 feet. If at any point an animal critically succeeds at its save or no animal is within 100 feet, the vrykolakas fails to possess anything and is destroyed. A vrykolakas possessing an animal seeks out its burial site (see Burial Site Bound below) immediately, burying itself there. While the vrykolakas is in this state of recovery, its animal host is paralyzed, and beheading it destroys the vrykolakas and kills its host. Removing the curse destroys the vrykolakas and returns the animal to normal. After 1d4 days, if the vrykolakas hasn't been destroyed, the animal dies and the vrykolakas rises in a new body that's identical to its previous one, formed from the animal's remains. Vrykolakas Vulnerabilities Vrykolakas all have the following vulnerabilities. Burial Site Bound A vrykolakas is bound to the place of its death or interment. It must return to this location once per week and bury itself in the earth for 24 hours, during which time it is paralyzed and can be beheaded. If it is unable to return to this site, it is reduced to 0 Hit Points and attempts to use Feral Corruption; if this host animal can't return to the burial site before the possession effect ends, the vrykolakas is destroyed and the animal host returns to normal. Vulnerable to Decapitation A vrykolakas that is beheaded can't use its Feral Possession, and a beheaded corpse cannot rise as a vrykolakas. Climb Speed A vrykolakas gains a climb Speed equal to one-half its land Speed. Claws If the base creature had hands, it gains an unarmed claw Strike that deals slashing damage and has the agile trait. Use the moderate damage for the creature's level on the Strike Damage table. Fangs The teeth of the vrykolakas grow long, sharp, and deadly, granting it a fangs Strike: an unarmed attack that deals piercing damage and enables the use of its Drink Blood ability. Use the high damage for the creature's level on the Strike Damage table. Drink Blood Single Action (divine, necromancy) Requirements The vrykolakas' last action was a successful fangs Strike; Effect The vrykolakas sinks its fangs into that creature to drink its blood. This requires an Athletics check against the creature's Fortitude DC. On a success, the creature becomes drained 1, and the vrykolakas regains HP equal to 10% of its maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire, but it increases the creature's drained condition value by 1. A vrykolakas can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but it gains no HP from doing so. The target creature's drained condition value decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes. Rend Single Action The vrykolakas gains the Rend action with its claws. Vrykolakas Master Abilities Particularly powerful vrykolakas can create spawn from the bodies of their victims and gain additional abilities, as detailed below. Creatures of 9th level or higher can become a vrykolakas master, while those of 12th level or higher who have survived for centuries might become a vrykolakas ancient. Children of the Night (divine, enchantment, mental) The presence of a vrykolakas master inspires savage creatures to crawl forth to do its bidding, including rat swarms, warg, werewolves, and similar creatures. The vrykolakas master can give telepathic orders to these creatures within 100 feet, but they can't communicate back. Pestilential Aura (aura, divine, necromancy) 5 feet. Creatures beginning their turn in the area while the vrykolakas is in its true form are exposed to bubonic plague. Divine Innate Spells The vrykolakas master can cast vampiric touch (heightened to half its level rounded up) and 3rd-level fear three times per day each as divine innate spells. It uses a high DC for its level. Bubonic Plague (disease) Saving Throw Fortitude (use a high DC for the vrykolakas's level); Onset 1 day; Stage 1 fatigued (1 day); Stage 2 enfeebled 2 and fatigued (1 day); Stage 3 enfeebled 3, fatigued, and takes 1d6 persistent bleed damage every 1d20 minutes (1 day) Change Shape Single Action (concentrate, divine, polymorph, transmutation) A vrykolakas master can transform into a form resembling the body it had in life, with the effects of humanoid form but with unlimited duration. It loses its fangs and claw Strikes but gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Deception checks to Impersonate in this form. Create Spawn (divine, downtime, necromancy) If a creature dies after being reduced to 0 HP by Drink Blood, a vrykolakas master can turn this creature into a vrykolakas spawn by donating some of its own blood to the creature and burying it in earth for 3 nights. Such vrykolakas spawn are generally friendly to the vrykolakas that created them, but they are not under its control and typically wander off on their own rampage within 1d6 days of their creation. Dominate Animal Single Action (divine, enchantment, incapacitation, mental) The vrykolakas can cast dominate at will as a divine innate spell that affects only animals. The save DC is a high DC for the vrykolakas's level, and a creature that succeeds is immune to that vrykolakas's Dominate Animal for 24 hours. Destroying the vrykolakas ends the effect, but reducing it to 0 HP does not. A dominated animal takes a –4 circumstance penalty to saving throws against the vrykolakas's Feral Possession. Drink Blood As a typical vrykolakas, but the creature is drained 2 instead of 1.","type":"Creature Family","url":"/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=159","weakness":{}}},{"_index":"aon18","_id":"creature-family-160","_score":4.166701,"_source":{"breadcrumbs_spa":[],"category":"creature-family","creature_family":"Wolverine","creature_family_markdown":"Wolverine","exclude_from_search":false,"id":"creature-family-160","image":["/Images/Monsters/Wolverine.png"],"markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Creature Family\">[Wolverine](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=160)</title>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 295 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\nFew creatures in the natural world can compare in ferocity to an angry wolverine.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Giant Wolverine](/Monsters.aspx?ID=863) (Creature 4), [Wolverine](/Monsters.aspx?ID=862) (Creature 2)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Territorial Beasts</title>\r\n\r\nWolverines are territorial animals and fiercely defend their kills, even from larger predators or when they're outnumbered.

It retains any spellcasting abilities it had in life, regardless of their origin, and gains the abilities listed below.

Typically, this requires the application of an area effect or [splash](/Traits.aspx?ID=150) weapon within 1 round to the space where the worm that walks collapsed. After any amount of area or splash damage is dealt to that space, the character dealing the damage must attempt a DC 15 flat check. Each subsequent area or splash damage effect performed on the area reduces the DC of this flat check by 2, to a minimum of DC 5. If any of these flat checks succeed, none of the worms escape, and the worm that walks is destroyed permanently. At the GM’s discretion, clever means of trapping or otherwise detaining the vermin may extend the time allowed to finish off the worm that walks. \n\n**Tendril** Regardless of the creature’s former anatomy, it gains a tendril melee Strike with reach that deals [persistent piercing damage](/Conditions.aspx?ID=29) as it leaves biting worms on the target.

They arise as a result of necromantic rituals, especially violent deaths, or the sheer malevolent will of the deceased.\n\n As many types of wights exist as types of people from which they might be created. Hulking brutes, skittering sneaks, and cunning tinkers all make for different wights with different niches to fill. Environment, too, plays a part in determining a wight's special abilities and defenses. Frost wights, for instances, can be found in the parts of the world where exposure is a common end. Regardless, wights typically haunt burial grounds, catacombs, or other places of the dead. But their hunger is targeted toward the living—those individuals who remind them of the shackles of mortality and whom they feel compelled to “free” to the state of undeath.\n\n A single wight can wreak a lot of havoc if it is compelled to rise from its tomb. Because creatures slain by wights become wights as well, all it takes is a single wight and a handful of unlucky graveyard visitors to create a veritable horde of these undead. Thus, canny priests and adventurers know that the best solution to a wight problem is swift and total eradication. Care must be taken, though, to destroy wight spawn before attempting to destroy the parent wight, for spawn without a master gain the ability to create spawn of their own.\n\n Durable and sustained as they are by negative energy, wights can last in harsh environments without decaying the way some lesser undead do. They might dwell in high mountain passes, sealed passageways, or submerged in bogs or lakes for decades or even centuries before the passage of an unsuspecting traveler rouses them from their rest.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Cairn Wight](/Monsters.aspx?ID=859) (Creature 4), [Hunter Wight](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1915) (Creature 7), [Prowler Wight](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1916) (Creature 9), [Wight](/Monsters.aspx?ID=413) (Creature 3), [Wight Commander](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1917) (Creature 12)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_6_Geb.png\">Wights And Weaponry</title>\r\n\r\nFor the rank-and-file wight, only the scrape of blackened fingernails steals the essence of life.

They arise as a result of necromantic rituals, especially violent deaths, or the sheer malevolent will of the deceased. As many types of wights exist as types of people from which they might be created. Hulking brutes, skittering sneaks, and cunning tinkers all make for different wights with different niches to fill. Environment, too, plays a part in determining a wight's special abilities and defenses. Frost wights, for instances, can be found in the parts of the world where exposure is a common end. Regardless, wights typically haunt burial grounds, catacombs, or other places of the dead. But their hunger is targeted toward the living—those individuals who remind them of the shackles of mortality and whom they feel compelled to “free” to the state of undeath. A single wight can wreak a lot of havoc if it is compelled to rise from its tomb. Because creatures slain by wights become wights as well, all it takes is a single wight and a handful of unlucky graveyard visitors to create a veritable horde of these undead. Thus, canny priests and adventurers know that the best solution to a wight problem is swift and total eradication. Care must be taken, though, to destroy wight spawn before attempting to destroy the parent wight, for spawn without a master gain the ability to create spawn of their own. Durable and sustained as they are by negative energy, wights can last in harsh environments without decaying the way some lesser undead do. They might dwell in high mountain passes, sealed passageways, or submerged in bogs or lakes for decades or even centuries before the passage of an unsuspecting traveler rouses them from their rest.

Many stronger wights bind to armaments, either through the ritual that raised them or a sentimental attachment to a weapon they wielded. Not only are these weapons more versatile, but deploying them can surprise foes accustomed to the limits of average wights.

Although they typically make their lairs among the highlands, the pursuit of justice leads silver dragons to travel far and wide—often into the very heart of realms overrun by evil. These exemplars of righteousness are ceaseless in their determination to help the weak, spread honor, and stamp out evil.\n\n  Silver dragons are sleek and sinuous. Their hides resemble nothing so much as a suit of gleaming armor, lending further credence to the popular myth that silver dragons are the paladins of dragonkind. The zeal with which they seek out, confront, and defeat evil is unsurpassed even among their metallic cousins, and they adhere to strict codes of honor usually passed down from parent to hatchling. On occasion, they instead learn these codes from trusted mentors, usually other silver dragons or gold dragons. As they age, they become even more dedicated to their codes, often adding new and even more restrictive clauses to the systems that guide their behavior.\n\n  Silver dragons are incredibly altruistic and regularly consort with the citizens of goodly societies, of which they consider themselves protectors and guides. In addition to responding to evil threats, silver dragons work to prevent evil from taking root in the first place, and they ensure mortals under their care are well fed, educated, and treated with dignity. Although silver dragons can seem overzealous or even eager to join the fight against evil, they know that the best way to rid the world of corruption is to stamp out strife and disillusionment at their source, not to passively sit back and watch it grow into an unsolvable problem.

Although they typically make their lairs among the highlands, the pursuit of justice leads silver dragons to travel far and wide—often into the very heart of realms overrun by evil. These exemplars of righteousness are ceaseless in their determination to help the weak, spread honor, and stamp out evil. Silver dragons are sleek and sinuous. Their hides resemble nothing so much as a suit of gleaming armor, lending further credence to the popular myth that silver dragons are the paladins of dragonkind. The zeal with which they seek out, confront, and defeat evil is unsurpassed even among their metallic cousins, and they adhere to strict codes of honor usually passed down from parent to hatchling. On occasion, they instead learn these codes from trusted mentors, usually other silver dragons or gold dragons. As they age, they become even more dedicated to their codes, often adding new and even more restrictive clauses to the systems that guide their behavior. Silver dragons are incredibly altruistic and regularly consort with the citizens of goodly societies, of which they consider themselves protectors and guides.

Their beauty is a source of great pride but is also something of a weakness, as crystal dragons are easily angered by insults about their appearance. Despite their relatively benign natures when compared to other true dragons, crystal dragons can be short tempered and prone to finding insults where none were intended. Although their opinions are changeable, crystal dragons prefer orderly environments and are not fond of sudden interruptions or distractions.\n\n  Crystal dragons build their lairs in underground grottoes, where they cultivate environments of great beauty. Their exacting standards and vivid imaginations mean that they are always working to improve the appearance or layout of some part of their lair. These lairs are unique to each individual crystal dragon, but there are always plenty of reflective surfaces that allow the dragon to observe their own appearance.

Their beauty is a source of great pride but is also something of a weakness, as crystal dragons are easily angered by insults about their appearance. Despite their relatively benign natures when compared to other true dragons, crystal dragons can be short tempered and prone to finding insults where none were intended. Although their opinions are changeable, crystal dragons prefer orderly environments and are not fond of sudden interruptions or distractions. Crystal dragons build their lairs in underground grottoes, where they cultivate environments of great beauty. Their exacting standards and vivid imaginations mean that they are always working to improve the appearance or layout of some part of their lair. These lairs are unique to each individual crystal dragon, but there are always plenty of reflective surfaces that allow the dragon to observe their own appearance. These range from crystals to reflecting pools to finely crafted mirrors, which are arranged throughout the lair in a pleasing array. Gifts of well-crafted or magical mirrors are an excellent way to curry favor with a crystal dragon. Although crystal dragons are easily distracted by their sparkling collections or their vanity, they remain good-hearted creatures at the core and make friends quickly. While a crystal dragon tends to find evil creatures uncouth and unpleasant, any other nearby denizen or inhabitant of their home could become fast friends or beloved pets, depending upon the creature's capacity for conversation (and for providing the frequent praise and compliments that crystal dragons hunger for).

Check with Friends Sahkils are creatures of fear and terror. Roleplaying encounters with sahkils could be troubling to some players, and delving deep into the kinds of traumas sahkils relish in unleashing could have unintentional effects on your game and your friends. Before introducing sahkils into your game, talk with your players to learn about any particular phobias or limits to determine what content you bring to the table, and consider that on your own behalf as well. Some specific elements to be aware of are the ximtal's abilities around sensory deprivation and social isolation, as well as the kimenhul's trauma-related abilities and themes. Couatls and Sahkils Legends in Arcadia say that couatls and sahkils both rose to prominence as the first mortals walked on Golarion. Each saw unique potential in the mortals; couatls saw hope and the potential to rise to achieve great feats, while sahkils saw the potential for fear. Fearful mortals would never accomplish anything, becoming useless piles of flesh whose souls would languish. These withered souls would be unable to properly travel the River of Souls, disrupting the delicate balance of the afterlife. To this day, couatls work to inspire mortals and push them toward greater tasks while striving to keep the sahkils' terror at bay Embodiments of Fear All sahkils have horrifying appearances, and each type specializes in exacerbating a specific fear in mortals. Penquals embody not only a fear of crowds, but also of confined spaces and of being lost within a sea of unfamiliar faces. Nenchuujes embody both the fear of magic's horrifying side effects as well as the fear that one's own magic might be twisted to an unexpected or tragic end. Feeding on Fear Sahkils are immortal planar beings and don't require material sustenance, but they do seem to gain some semblance of nourishment from the fear they spread. Whether this is psychological or biological remains to be seen, but their obsession with frightening other creatures is clear. Sahkils recognize that they are already feared, so it may be that they are simply fulfilling what they believe is their ultimate purpose. Planar Relations Sahkils collaborate with divs (page 68) to corrupt and corrode mortals. Velstracs, who appreciate sahkils' depredations, sometimes work with these fiends to enact terrible horror on their victims. Nihilistic and disaffected, daemons tolerate sahkils but tend to view them as useless provocateurs. Sahkil Tormentors The most powerful among sahkils are the sahkil tormentors.

Members Shanrigol Behemoth (Creature 9), Shanrigol Heap (Creature 4) Shanrigol Components As shanrigols incorporate pieces of creatures near their hunting ground, explorers who examine a shanrigol can gain many valuable clues about nearby creatures. In the case of a shanrigol behemoth, these explorers might find the beast using strange abilities from creatures they haven't yet faced! Shanrigol Treasure Because these undead aberrations seek only to absorb more flesh, they don't care about material things. When near a shanrigol's lair, it's not uncommon to see bloody armor, unsheathed weapons, and intact potion bottles scattered around the site of a battle. A shanrigol's fruitful ambush location is likely to have piles of overlooked valuable treasure from past victims.

The first wisps roamed the Inner Sphere in shifting symphonies that traded members with their every meeting. These symphonies of free wisps created music out of their combined resonances, but when the evil [Elemental Lords](/DeityCategories.aspx?ID=8) realized the value of the wisps' resonance, they captured whole symphonies for use as servants.\n\n Wisps attune to each other and to those they surround themselves with. This attunement makes them naturally supportive allies. Free wisps still roam the Inner Sphere and the [Material Plane](/Planes.aspx?ID=1), but they're usually shy and hide themselves from strangers. However, they happily offer their service to those who show them kindness. They especially find themselves drawn to spellcasters who practice elemental magic; these wisps usually watch from afar but sometimes approach those who seem safe to become familiars or comrades.\n\n Free wisps who find one another become close almost immediately. They get especially excited when they find wisps of elements other than their own, showing none of the animosity some elementals exhibit toward other types.

The first wisps roamed the Inner Sphere in shifting symphonies that traded members with their every meeting. These symphonies of free wisps created music out of their combined resonances, but when the evil Elemental Lords realized the value of the wisps' resonance, they captured whole symphonies for use as servants. Wisps attune to each other and to those they surround themselves with. This attunement makes them naturally supportive allies. Free wisps still roam the Inner Sphere and the Material Plane, but they're usually shy and hide themselves from strangers. However, they happily offer their service to those who show them kindness. They especially find themselves drawn to spellcasters who practice elemental magic; these wisps usually watch from afar but sometimes approach those who seem safe to become familiars or comrades. Free wisps who find one another become close almost immediately. They get especially excited when they find wisps of elements other than their own, showing none of the animosity some elementals exhibit toward other types. Instead, they join in an excited dance, emitting resonances that faintly echo the symphonies of ancient days.

Some believe they were created by a long-dead god millennia ago to act as guardians, but girtablilus consider the subject of their origin taboo and refuse to address the theory.\n\n Because girtablilus accept a wide range of religions and belief systems, some outsiders believe they also worship their own ancient pantheon.

In this way, they act as preservers of holy practices that have otherwise been forgotten beneath the desert's shifting sands.\n\n Though girtablilus are used to explorers seeking entrance to the sites they defend, they might welcome those who earnestly wish to learn or offer reverence. A few even proudly share their beliefs with others, eager for the opportunity to preach to someone new.

They require relatively little food or water, and they rely on their stamina to outlast their enemies.

They are most often found defending ancient temples and religious artifacts with zealous fervor. Some believe they were created by a long-dead god millennia ago to act as guardians, but girtablilus consider the subject of their origin taboo and refuse to address the theory. Because girtablilus accept a wide range of religions and belief systems, some outsiders believe they also worship their own ancient pantheon. Instead, girtablilus exclusively revere and protect sites dedicated to deities considered lost to civilization. In this way, they act as preservers of holy practices that have otherwise been forgotten beneath the desert's shifting sands. Though girtablilus are used to explorers seeking entrance to the sites they defend, they might welcome those who earnestly wish to learn or offer reverence. A few even proudly share their beliefs with others, eager for the opportunity to preach to someone new. But girtablilus show no mercy to those who attempt to desecrate the sites and objects of their worship, or to those who would violate the tenets of their faith. Girtablilus are skilled fighters who keep trained giant scorpions as pets, and they remain unmatched when it comes to fighting in the desert. They require relatively little food or water, and they rely on their stamina to outlast their enemies. When necessary, they can stalk their quarry for days or even weeks, coordinating with their pets to drive their prey in circles. Once exhausted, few foes can stand up to a girtablilu's physical prowess—or their deadly venom.

Kovintus live in small groups in natural places far from larger civilizations. A typical kovintus settlement consists of natural houses built into the environment around a central meeting place. The form fits the terrain, with dwellings nestled into crags on a mountain or forming a windbreak on a plain. Though kovintus beliefs can greatly differ based on their home terrain, many of these creatures believe their intrinsic commonality through nature links them more intimately than such superficial differences. Once, all kovintus lived in their ancient home, the Valley—a place of bounty and natural splendor unheard of in the modern world. This paradise was lost in ancient times, and the kovintus set out in small groups to find new homes. Today, any valley kovintus come upon is called merely an “echo” of the true Valley. Rather than seeking their original valley, kovintus believe the cycles of nature will someday bring about a new home with the same grandeur. Kovintus faith calls for respect rather than reverence. When traveling away from home, kovintus believe it's crucial to respect any local deities who have built the land they stand upon, and pay them tribute with small offerings. Members Kovintus Geomancer (Creature 3) The Four Branches A limb with four branches represents kovintus subgroups based on terrain. A brown branch stands for the kovintus nerha of rocky hills and deserts, blue for the kovintus bree of shores and riverbanks, green for the kovintus yoro of forests, and white for the kovintus weg of high places closer to the skies.

Their predominant culture promotes nobility of both deed and heart, and many munavri dedicate their lives to waging war against those who sew discord in the Darklands. Members Munavri Spellblade (Creature 2) A Light in the Darkness Munavris can play an important role in Darklands adventures, acting as allies in an environment where shelter and supplies are hard to come by.

In addition to the skull swarms detailed here, swarms of other types of beheaded with corresponding abilities can be found in any region plagued by excessive decapitation. Sea Skulls Skull swarms are most commonly encountered amid ruins where vast and uncontrolled necromantic energies have erupted, but they can also appear in aquatic environments with clusters of clacking skulls from merfolk and sea devil, feral skulls of fish and cetaceans, or even disembodied shark jaws and cephalopod beaks.

Strix communities debate whether this curse still haunts their people. Those that believe so cite the endless bloody conflict between the strix tribes and the nearby humans, who regard the strix as winged devils to be purged from their territories. Due to strix's deep emotional connection to each member of their tribe, any strix life taken by human hands leads to swift retaliation, which humans use to paint strix as monsters.

Strix possess angular features and piercing eyes that are fixed facing forward. Their lurching head movements and vertical eyelids give an unnerving quality to their humanoid appearances. Strix, called itarii in their own language, live in tightly bonded roosts nestled into the cliffs and treetops of Golarion's highest elevations. Their societies mostly share a communalist, tribal structure, each led by a female leader called a rokoa. Their dwindling population, combined with the adversity they face, promotes interconnectedness and empathy, even between different tribes. By contrast, strix face an ageless conflict with the human populations that surround their home at Devil's Perch, forced to fiercely defend their ancestral territories against human incursion. As a result, strix distrust humans on sight, though these grudges typically don't extend to human offshoots, such as half-orcs and half-elves. Oral tradition tells that the strix who live among the spires of Devil's Perch, an area in the southwest region of Cheliax's Menador Mountains, were banished there by a massive storm as punishment for an ancient, forgotten transgression. Strix communities debate whether this curse still haunts their people. Those that believe so cite the endless bloody conflict between the strix tribes and the nearby humans, who regard the strix as winged devils to be purged from their territories. Due to strix's deep emotional connection to each member of their tribe, any strix life taken by human hands leads to swift retaliation, which humans use to paint strix as monsters. This cycle of retribution, along with continuous loss of strix land, has bred generations of hatred. Members Strix Kinmate (Creature 2) Strix Storytelling Strix history and mythology is passed down through a verbal tradition. Every strix, even those from different tribes, knows nearly identical tales of their ancestral history and spiritual sermons.

To brandish garlic or a religious symbol, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to [Raise a Shield](/Actions.aspx?ID=98)). If the nosferatu involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of their revulsion, they gain the [fleeing](/Conditions.aspx?ID=17) condition, running from the object of their revulsion until they end an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of their revulsion, a nosferatu can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the [concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32) trait.

Staking a nosferatu requires 3 actions and works only if the nosferatu is [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38). If the stake is removed, the nosferatu can heal above 0 HP again, and if they're in their coffin, the 1-hour rest period begins once the stake is removed. If the nosferatu's head is severed and anointed with holy water while the stake is in place, the nosferatu is destroyed.</li><li>**Sunlight** If exposed to direct sunlight, a nosferatu immediately becomes [slowed 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=35). The slowed value increases by 1 each time the nosferatu ends their turn in sunlight, and the condition ends when they're no longer in sunlight.

If even a single rat reaches the coffin, the nosferatu can recover. A nosferatu regains their strength through resting in earth taken from the grave of a creature who died of plague. If their body rests in their earth-filled coffin for 1 hour, the nosferatu gains 1 HP, after which their fast healing begins to function normally.

Perhaps because of their age, …","text":" Vampire, Nosferatu Source Bestiary 3 pg. 282 Among the most ancient of vampires are the nosferatus, twisted remnants of mortals who died in great plagues of old. Perhaps because of their age, nosferatus can no longer create more of their kind. Yet they still lurk among the living, manipulating the hearts and minds of their prey to either serve them beyond the limits of natural life or to become sustenance for the nosferatu like so many others before. Members Nosferatu Malefactor (Creature 10), Nosferatu Overlord (Creature 15), Nosferatu Thrall (Creature 8) Among the Living Though terrifying in appearance, nosferatus typically dwell among mortals. They might reside in a decrepit manor nestled in a quiet neighborhood. They may also occupy an abandoned castle, preying on weary travelers who mistake their lair as a haven from the elements. Building a Nosferatu Though nosferatus can't create more of their kind, many of these ancient vampires lurk in the world's various shadows, taking a variety of forms. If you have time, it's more effective to build a new nosferatu from the ground up using the standard monster creation rules, which were used to create the nosferatu thrall, nosferatu malefactor, and nosferatu overlord, but you can also use the guidelines presented under Creating a Nosferatu to turn an existing creature into a nosferatu, adjusting the monster as you see fit. In either case, specific nosferatu abilities like negative healing, Feral Corruption, and Drink Blood work the same. Building a Nosferatu Thrall While a nosferatu can't turn a living creature into another nosferatu, they can create a thrall through a 1-day ritual. They can maintain a number of thralls up to their Charisma modifier; creating new thralls beyond this limit releases earlier thralls from service. You can convert any non-mindless living creature into a nosferatu thrall by applying the nosferatu thrall abilities and increasing its level by 1. A creature that's immune to mental effects can't become a nosferatu thrall. You can also build a nosferatu thrall from scratch using the monster creation rules in the Gamemastery Guide and applying the above modifications. Monster of Legend The word nosferatu has appeared in print since the mid-18th century, purported by Western Europeans to be a Romanian word for vampire, inspiring some of horror fiction's best writers. No clear etymology exists, and while it's unknown whether the word's roots are actually Romanian, the vampire itself is an enduring element of Romanian folklore. Vampire Related Families Vampire, Vampire, Jiang-Shi, Vampire, Strigoi, Vampire, Vetalarana, Vampire, Vrykolakas Creating a Nosferatu You can turn an existing living creature into a nosferatu using the following steps. A creature below 8th level isn't significant enough to be a nosferatu and should likely be a regular vampire instead. Increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. It gains the undead and vampire traits, and it becomes evil. Increase AC, attack bonuses, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1. Increase Speed by 5 feet or to 30 feet, whichever results in a higher Speed. Increase damage with Strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. If an ability can be used only a small number of times (such as a dragon's Breath Weapon), increase the damage by 2 instead. Reduce HP by the amount listed on the table. The nosferatu gains fast healing and resistance to physical damage (except magical wood) as indicated in the table. These abilities are the reason the nosferatu has fewer HP. Starting Level HP Decrease Fast Healing/Resistance 8-14 -40 10 15+ -60 15 Basic Nosferatu Abilities If the base creature becoming a nosferatu has any abilities that specifically come from it being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as human and humanoid. You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the nosferatu's theme. All nosferatus gain the following abilities. Darkvision Negative Healing Immunities death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, sleep Nosferatu Vulnerabilities Revulsion A nosferatu can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a brandished religious symbol of a non-evil deity. To brandish garlic or a religious symbol, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to Raise a Shield). If the nosferatu involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of their revulsion, they gain the fleeing condition, running from the object of their revulsion until they end an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of their revulsion, a nosferatu can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, they overcome their revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success). Stake A magical wooden stake (such as one affected by a weapon potency rune, magic weapon , or similar magic) driven through the nosferatu's heart drops the nosferatu to 0 HP and prevents them from healing above 0 HP, even in their coffin. Staking a nosferatu requires 3 actions and works only if the nosferatu is unconscious. If the stake is removed, the nosferatu can heal above 0 HP again, and if they're in their coffin, the 1-hour rest period begins once the stake is removed. If the nosferatu's head is severed and anointed with holy water while the stake is in place, the nosferatu is destroyed. Sunlight If exposed to direct sunlight, a nosferatu immediately becomes slowed 1. The slowed value increases by 1 each time the nosferatu ends their turn in sunlight, and the condition ends when they're no longer in sunlight. If the nosferatu loses all their actions in this way, they're destroyed. Plagued Coffin Restoration (divine, necromancy, negative) Unlike other undead, a nosferatu isn't destroyed at 0 HP. Instead, they disperse into an immense number of individual rats heading in every direction in an attempt to return to their coffin. If even a single rat reaches the coffin, the nosferatu can recover. A nosferatu regains their strength through resting in earth taken from the grave of a creature who died of plague. If their body rests in their earth-filled coffin for 1 hour, the nosferatu gains 1 HP, after which their fast healing begins to function normally. If the coffin doesn't contain this plagued grave dirt, they instead need to rest in their coffin for 1 day before they gain 1 HP and regain their fast healing. Change Shape Single Action (concentrate, divine, polymorph, transmutation) The nosferatu transforms into a swarm of pale-gray rats. They gain a land Speed of 30 feet and a climb Speed of 10 feet, and they become Large. Each enemy in the swarm's space takes 2d10 piercing damage and must attempt a basic Reflex save with a high DC for the creature's level. A creature that fails its save is exposed to plague of ancients (see below). Command Thrall Free Action (auditory, divine, mental) Requirements One of the nosferatu's thralls is present and can hear the nosferatu; Effect The nosferatu gives a single command to one of their thralls, which the thrall follows to the best of its ability during its next turn. Divine Innate Spells The nosferatu can cast telekinetic haul (heightened to half their level rounded up) three times per day as a divine innate spell. They use a high DC for their level. Plague of Ancients (disease, virulent) Saving Throw Fortitude (use a high DC for the nosferatu's level); Onset 1 day; Stage 1 drained 1 (1 day); Stage 2 drained 2 and enfeebled 2 (1 day); Stage 3 doomed 1, drained 3, and enfeebled 3 (1 day); Stage 4 doomed 2, drained 3, and enfeebled 3 (1 day); Stage 5 unconscious (1 day); Stage 6 death Dominate Two Actions (divine, enchantment, incapacitation, mental, visual) The nosferatu can cast dominate at will as a divine innate spell. Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the visual trait. The save DC uses a high DC for the nosferatu's level, and a creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that nosferatu's Dominate for 24 hours. Fully destroying the nosferatu ends the domination, but merely reducing the nosferatu to 0 HP is insufficient to break the spell. Drink Blood Single Action (divine, necromancy) Requirements The nosferatu's last action was a successful fangs Strike; Effect The nosferatu sinks their fangs into the targeted creature to drink its blood. This requires an Athletics check against the creature's Fortitude DC. On a success, the creature becomes drained 1, and the nosferatu regains HP equal to 10% of their maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the nosferatu, but increases the creature's drained condition value by 1. A nosferatu can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but they gain no HP from doing so. The target creature's drained condition value decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes. Nosferatu Overlord Abilities A truly primeval nosferatu can gain extraordinary powers over their foes. Creatures must have lived for millennia and be 14th level or higher to become a nosferatu overlord. Air of Sickness (aura) 30 feet. A creature entering or starting its turn in the aura must attempt a Fortitude save with a moderate DC for the nosferatu's level. On a failure, the creature is sickened 1 and takes a –2 status penalty to saves made to resist diseases and remove the sickened condition for 1 hour. Divine Innate Spells As nosferatu, but they can also cast vampiric exsanguination twice per day as a divine innate spell. Paralytic Fear Free Action (divine, emotion, fear, incapacitation, mental) Requirements The nosferatu overlord's last action was a successful claw Strike; Effect The nosferatu drags the target of the Strike close and freezes its mind in terror. The target must attempt a Will save with a moderate DC for the nosferatu's level. Critical Success The target is unaffected. Success The target is immobilized by fear until the end of the nosferatu's next turn. Failure The target is restrained and takes a –2 circumstance penalty to its Fortitude DC against the nosferatu's Drink Blood ability until the end of the nosferatu's next turn. Critical Failure As failure, and the target is frightened 2. Nosferatu Thrall Abilities Any creature under a nosferatu's thrall gains the following abilities. Fast Healing A nosferatu thrall gains fast healing 5 from being sustained by their master's blood. Weaknesses The strain of being controlled wears on the nosferatu thrall's mind, giving them weakness 10 to mental damage. Mindbound (divine, enchantment) A nosferatu master exerts a fierce hold over their thrall's mind. If any creature other than the thrall's master targets them with an effect that would give them the controlled condition, the thrall's master rolls a counteract check against it using their Dominate DC - 10 as the counteract check modifier. Mortal Shield Reaction Trigger The thrall's master would take damage from a Strike or spell attack and is in an adjacent square; Effect The thrall throws themself in front of their master, taking half the damage of the attack (before applying any weaknesses or resistances). The thrall's master takes the remaining damage, applying any weaknesses or resistances as normal. Rally Reaction Trigger The thrall ends their turn more than 30 feet away from their master; Effect The thrall Strides up to their Speed toward their master.","type":"Creature Family","url":"/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=273","weakness":{}}},{"_index":"aon18","_id":"creature-family-274","_score":4.166701,"_source":{"breadcrumbs_spa":[],"category":"creature-family","creature_family":"Vanara","creature_family_markdown":"Vanara","exclude_from_search":false,"id":"creature-family-274","markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Creature Family\">[Vanara](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=274)</title>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 3](/Sources.aspx?ID=66) pg. 286</row>\n\nVanaras are monkey-like humanoids who dwell in treetop villages high in the canopies of lush jungles and verdant forests.

The cleric determines any targets or area for the spell as if they were standing in the divine warden's space.","type":"Creature Family","url":"/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=279","weakness":{}}},{"_index":"aon18","_id":"creature-family-280","_score":4.166701,"_source":{"breadcrumbs_spa":[],"category":"creature-family","creature_family":"Kitsune","creature_family_markdown":"Kitsune","exclude_from_search":false,"id":"creature-family-280","markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Creature Family\">[Kitsune](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=280)</title>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Bestiary 3](/Sources.aspx?ID=66) pg. 150</row>\n\nKitsune are shapeshifting, fox-like humanoids who have been blessed by the spirits.

As spiritual representations of whatever they inhabit, hantus follow no preordained agenda. Some hantus choose to act as guardians, defending the forest or waterway that they represent, while others simply set out into the world and experience the wonders of life in ways that their physical form—be it a boulder, bamboo stand, or tapir—would typically be unable to enjoy.\n\n Hantus are most well known in the archipelago of Minata, particularly in the southern islands of Rendah Pulu, where animists believe that hantus manifest in locations imbued with significant spiritual power. To the residents of Rendah Pulu, hantus exist as manifestations of their culture's anxieties, fears, and ills. An individual who encounters a hantu might interpret the meeting as a sign that they have dwelt for too long on their particular worries (or the opposite: they have ignored the source of their anxieties for too long).\n\n Interestingly, although hantus are [incorporeal](/Traits.aspx?ID=222), they still retain tangible characteristics as varied as hantus themselves. Some give off a potent odor, such as the scent of durian or jasmine. Others leave corporeal droppings, such as literal animal waste or tufts of fur left on a tree trunk.\n\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Hantu Belian](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1397) (Creature 11), [Hantu Denai](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1396) (Creature 9)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Calling a Hantu</title>\r\n\r\nThe spiritual nature of a hantu allows divine spellcasters to draw them forth with complex rituals. These rituals typically require a piece of the entity that the hantu embodies, such as a cup of water from a river or a bit of fur from a tapir. A successful ritual tugs a hantu toward the site of the ritual.

As spiritual …","text":" Hantu Source Pathfinder #166: Despair on Danger Island pg. 84 Hantus are manifestations of the powerful nature spirits that inhabit all things, from animals to objects to the environment itself. As spiritual representations of whatever they inhabit, hantus follow no preordained agenda. Some hantus choose to act as guardians, defending the forest or waterway that they represent, while others simply set out into the world and experience the wonders of life in ways that their physical form—be it a boulder, bamboo stand, or tapir—would typically be unable to enjoy. Hantus are most well known in the archipelago of Minata, particularly in the southern islands of Rendah Pulu, where animists believe that hantus manifest in locations imbued with significant spiritual power. To the residents of Rendah Pulu, hantus exist as manifestations of their culture's anxieties, fears, and ills. An individual who encounters a hantu might interpret the meeting as a sign that they have dwelt for too long on their particular worries (or the opposite: they have ignored the source of their anxieties for too long). Interestingly, although hantus are incorporeal, they still retain tangible characteristics as varied as hantus themselves. Some give off a potent odor, such as the scent of durian or jasmine. Others leave corporeal droppings, such as literal animal waste or tufts of fur left on a tree trunk. Members Hantu Belian (Creature 11), Hantu Denai (Creature 9) Calling a Hantu The spiritual nature of a hantu allows divine spellcasters to draw them forth with complex rituals. These rituals typically require a piece of the entity that the hantu embodies, such as a cup of water from a river or a bit of fur from a tapir. A successful ritual tugs a hantu toward the site of the ritual. A hantu typically listens to the requests of those who summoned it; whether it agrees to these requests, on the other hand, is another story. Other Hantus Hantus can manifest from any manner of object or being, so an endless variety of the spirits exist. The following are some of the best-known examples of hantu kind. Hantu Batu : These playful stone spirits throw rocks and pebbles with alarming frequency. Hantu Beruk : These monkey spirits possess people (especially those with a naturally stoic or sober demeanor) and use their bodies to perform great acrobatic feats or perform mesmerizing dances. Hantu Hutan : These jungle spirits defends their homes by shapeshifting into animals and plants to keep eyes on those who dare enter their domain.

You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the jiang-shi's theme. All jiang-shi gain the following abilities. \n\n**[Darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)** \n\n**Breathsense** 60 feet ([precise](/Rules.aspx?ID=411)). A jiang-shi can't perceive living creatures beyond 5 feet except with their breathsense. A living creature within the listed range who holds its breath is invisible to the jiang-shi for as long as it hold its breath. To hold its breath in this way, a creature must have one hand free to fully plug its nose or cover its mouth. (Refer to [Drowning and Suffocation](/Rules.aspx?ID=468) for the full rules on holding breath.) \n\n**[Negative Healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=42)** \n\n**Immunities** [death](/Traits.aspx?ID=40) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126), [sleep](/Traits.aspx?ID=145), [prone](/Conditions.aspx?ID=31) \n\n**One More Breath** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117), [negative](/Traits.aspx?ID=118)); Unlike other undead, a jiang-shi isn't destroyed at 0 HP. Instead, they fall [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38) and awaken in 1 minute with 1 Hit Point. Scattering at least 1 Bulk of glutinous rice or hen eggs on an unconscious jiang-shi destroys them permanently. If the jiang-shi was reduced to 0 HP by an attack from a weapon made of [darkwood](/Equipment.aspx?ID=273), they're destroyed immediately \n\n**Jiang-shi Vulnerabilities** All jiang-shi possess the following vulnerabilities.\n<ul><li>**Revulsion** A jiang-shi can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or the sound of ringing handbells. A creature can Interact with a mirror or handbell to brandish or ring that item for 1 round (similar to [Raising a Shield](/Actions.aspx?ID=98)). If the jiang-shi involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of their revulsion, they gain the [fleeing](/Conditions.aspx?ID=17) condition, running from the object of their revulsion until they are 10 feet or farther from the object. After 1 round of being exposed to the object of their revulsion, a jiang-shi can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the [concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32) trait. On a success, they overcome their revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success).</li><li>**Bitter Epiphany** A jiang-shi is afflicted by severe melancholia when reminded of their debased nature and the truth of their existential disconnection from living beings. When a jiang-shi sees an altar with at least 1 Bulk of food offerings to ancestor spirits, they must attempt a DC 25 Will save. They are then temporarily immune to bitter epiphany for 1 minute.<br /> **Critical Success** The jiang-shi is unaffected.<br /> **Success** The jiang-shi is [stupefied 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=37) for 1 round.<br /> **Failure** The jiang-shi is stupefied 2 for 1 minute.<br /> **Critical Failure** The jiang-shi is stupefied 2 and [confused](/Conditions.aspx?ID=5) for 1 minute. </li></ul>**Warped Fulu** The jiang-shi has corrupted the fulu attached to their brow. The jiang-shi is immune to spells cast from a magic item without expending a spell slot, such as from a scroll or wand. A creature can [Steal](/Actions.aspx?ID=68) a jiang-shi's fulu to remove it, rolling against the jiang-shi's Perception DC. This immediately ends the jiang-shi's immunity to these effects. If a creature then destroys a jiang-shi's removed fulu with an Interact action, the jiang-shi also loses their [fast healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=15) ability. A jiang-shi can create a replacement fulu by spending 1 uninterrupted hour inscribing a strip of paper (or similar) with a writing instrument. \n\n**Rigor Mortis** The jiang-shi ignores difficult terrain and effects that would render it [prone](/Conditions.aspx?ID=31). A jiang-shi can't take the [Drop Prone](/Actions.aspx?ID=78) action. When a jiang-shi [Leap](/Actions.aspx?ID=81), it doesn't trigger reactions that are normally triggered by [move](/Traits.aspx?ID=114) actions, such as [Attacks of Opportunity](/Actions.aspx?ID=8). \n\n**Claws** If the base creature had hands, its fingernails thicken and grow to terrible proportions, granting it an unarmed claw Strike that deals slashing damage, has the [agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170) trait, and can [Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=18). Use the moderate damage for the creature's level on the [Strike Damage](/Rules.aspx?ID=1018) table. \n\n**Drain Qi** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) **Requirement** A [grabbed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=20), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [restrained](/Conditions.aspx?ID=33), [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38), or willing creature is within the jiang-shi's reach; **Effect** The jiang-shi drains the victim's life energy, or qi, through their breath. This requires an [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) check against the  victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is [drained 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=10) and the jiang-shi regains HP equal to 10% of its maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Draining qi from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the jiang-shi but increases the victim's drained condition value by 1. If the victim has the ability to cast ki spells, it can spend 1 Focus Point to avoid becoming drained. This protects it only from the current attack, not from subsequent attempts to Drain Qi.<br /> A victim's drained condition value decreases by 1 every week. If the creature restricts their diet to glutinous rice for at least 1 day and spends 10 minutes dancing, jogging, or otherwise engaging in vigorous physical activity by succeeding at a DC 25 Athletics check, it reduces its drained condition by 1. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Jiang-Shi Minister Abilities</title> Those rare jiang-shi who have devoured at least a thousand victims' qi have shed many of their frailties and become able to create jiang-shi from their slain victims. These imperious undead address themselves as “ministers” or by other grandiose titles, and they mock lesser jiang-shi as mere “provincials.”\n\n Ministers gain additional jiang-shi abilities, as detailed below. A creature below level 13 is not significant enough to become a minister—you should instead simply make such a creature into a regular jiang-shi or rebuild the creature so that it's at least level 13 before becoming a minister. \n\n**Resistances** The jiang-shi resists all physical damage (except magical [darkwood](/Equipment.aspx?ID=273)). \n\n**Dark Enlightenment** The jiang-shi is no longer limited to seeing living creatures with only their breathsense, and they no longer have the Revulsion vulnerability. They can perceive living creatures normally with either [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12) or breathsense, and they can take the [Drop Prone](/Actions.aspx?ID=78) action. \n\n**Distant Steps** When the jiang-shi [Leaps](/Actions.aspx?ID=81), they can add 10 feet to the horizontal and/or vertical distance they move without affecting the Leap DC. The jiang-shi can stand and walk on water and other solid or liquid surfaces that wouldn't normally support their weight. \n\n**Tumult of the Blood** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)); The third time a jiang-shi successfully Drains Qi within a single minute, they become [quickened](/Conditions.aspx?ID=32) for 1 minute.

Increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. It gains the undead and vampire traits, and usually becomes evil. Increase the creature's AC, attack modifiers, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1. Reduce the creature's Speed by 10 feet, to a minimum of 15 feet.

Often, they were once their land's mightiest general or most decorated war hero. This means graveknights don't just rush into a toe-to-toe melee. They've studied the land (often with the experienced and unrelenting gaze only the undead can bring to bear) and engineered troop movements, earthworks, and traps to ensure victory. They usually have reinforcements ready to deploy and redundant contingencies in place. Just as great strategists opine that an engagement is decided before the first blow is landed, a combat against a graveknight often feels like a desperate fight in a rapidly closing vise.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_4_RelatedCreatures.png\">Infamous Graveknights</title>\r\n\r\nSeveral of Golarion's most notorious villains are graveknights. The following examples are among the world's most infamous graveknights at large, and may inspire or serve as villains in your own games.\n\n **Lictor Shokneir:** Once the Hellknight leader of the notorious Order of the Crux, Lictor Shokneir was disgraced when he refused a royal order to disband his army of butchers. The other Hellknights surrounded him and razed his castle, Citadel Gheisteno, to the ground. However, Shokneir's determination sustains his now-undead form, and he and his undead legions have rebuilt the citadel in all its haunting glory.\n\n **The Black Prince:** Although the graveknight known simply as the Black Prince was redeemed centuries ago as part of Iomedae's 11 Acts, it is said that the prince's armor remains intact—and that vile forces conspire to reclaim it. If the armor is donned by one of the Black Prince's descendants, the Inner Sea will be beset by a terrible villain indeed. \r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Other Powers</title>\r\n\r\nYou can use the alternate abilities as examples to create new powers reflecting a graveknight's personality or history, or even swap out more than one power. Graveknights should be unique and memorable foes.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Steed Adaptations</title>\r\n\r\nFor some graveknights, their mount is more than a projection of their desire to move quickly around a battlefield. A graveknight's [_phantom steed_](/Spells.aspx?ID=221) might have the appearance, resistances, or movement of a favored mount the knight rode as a mortal, such as a [nightmare's](/Monsters.aspx?ID=308) resistance to fire or a [pegasus's](/Monsters.aspx?ID=329) Fly Speed.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Unique Destruction</title>\r\n\r\nWhile most graveknight armors can be destroyed with the standard means of destruction, particularly powerful graveknights might have more durable armor that requires additional steps to destroy. These are usually the armors of high-level graveknights, and their destruction steps are tied to the creation of the graveknight. For example, a specific graveknight armor can't be destroyed until it's struck by a descendant of the person that originally felled the graveknight in battle before their transformation.\r\n</aside>\n\n<title level=\"2\">Creating Graveknights</title>\r\n\r\nYou can turn an existing, living creature into a graveknight by completing the following steps. It's best to build a graveknight from scratch, but if you don't have the time, simply apply the template. A creature should be at least level 5 before being converted to a graveknight.<br /> Increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. \n<ul><li>Increase its attack rolls, AC, saving throws, Perception, and skills by 1, its HP by 5, and its Strike damage by 1.</li></ul> \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Graveknight Abilities</title> A graveknight gains the [undead](/Traits.aspx?ID=160) and graveknight traits, and its alignment is usually adjusted to evil. It loses any abilities that come from it being a living creature and any traits that represent its life, such as [human](/Traits.aspx?ID=90) and [humanoid](/Traits.aspx?ID=91).<br /> **[Darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)**<br /> **[Negative Healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=42)**<br /> **Rejuvenation** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) When a graveknight is destroyed, its armor rebuilds its body over the course of 1d10 days—or more quickly if the armor is worn by a living host (see Graveknight Armor, below). If the body is destroyed before then, the process restarts. A graveknight can only be permanently destroyed by obliterating its armor (such as with disintegrate), transporting it to the Positive Energy Plane, or throwing it into the heart of a volcano.<br /> **Immunities** [death](/Traits.aspx?ID=40) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126), precision, [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38), plus one energy type (the same chosen for ruinous weapons below).<br /> **Sacrilegious Aura** ([abjuration](/Traits.aspx?ID=2), [aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), <t>evil) 30 feet. When a creature in the aura uses a [positive](/Traits.aspx?ID=128) spell or ability, the graveknight automatically attempts to [counteract](/Rules.aspx?ID=371) it, with the listed counteract modifier.<br /> **Devastating Blast** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([arcane](/Traits.aspx?ID=11), [evocation](/Traits.aspx?ID=65)) The graveknight unleashes a 30-foot cone of energy. Creatures in the area take 1d12 damage, plus an additional 1d12 damage for every two levels the graveknight has ([basic](/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Reflex save). The graveknight can use this ability once every 1d4 rounds. This energy damage is of the same type as that of its ruinous weapons (see below); Devastating Blast gains the associated energy trait.<br /> **Phantom Mount** <actions string=\"Three Actions\" /> ([arcane](/Traits.aspx?ID=11), [conjuration](/Traits.aspx?ID=33), [summon](/Traits.aspx?ID=154)) The graveknight summons a supernatural mount as per [_phantom steed_](/Spells.aspx?ID=221), heightened to a level equal to half the graveknight's level. Unlike _phantom steed_, the steed's AC and saving throw bonuses are all 4 lower than the graveknight's, and the steed has one-third the graveknight's Hit Points (rounded down). If the steed is destroyed, the graveknight must wait 1 hour before using this ability again.<br /> **Ruinous Weapons** At the time of its creation, a graveknight chooses one of the following energy types that was relevant to its life or death: [acid](/Traits.aspx?ID=3), [cold](/Traits.aspx?ID=27), [electricity](/Traits.aspx?ID=56), or [fire](/Traits.aspx?ID=72). Any weapon the graveknight wields gains the effects of the [_corrosive_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=292), [_frost_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=296), [_shock_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=303), or [_flaming_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=295) weapon rune, respectively, in addition to a _+1 [striking](/Equipment.aspx?ID=280)_ weapon rune. If the graveknight is 14th level or higher, its weapons instead gain the effects of the greater versions of both of these runes.<br /> **Weapon Master** The graveknight has access to the [critical specialization effects](/Rules.aspx?ID=235) of any weapons it wields. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Alternate Graveknight Abilities</title> You can create a more unusual graveknight by substituting one of their  abilities (except for darkvision, negative healing, rejuvenation, or immunities) with one of the following.<br />  \n\n### Bestiary\n**Betrayed Revivification** The graveknight died after being deeply betrayed. Instead of being immune to a type of energy damage, it is immune to [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106) damage, its weapons deal 1d6 additional mental damage, and its Devastating Blast deals mental damage with a Will saving throw instead of Reflex.<br /> **Create Grave Squire** The graveknight can gift a piece of its armor to a willing ally, which becomes its grave squire. The graveknight can communicate telepathically with its squire at any distance, see through the squire's senses, and cast [_suggestion_](/Spells.aspx?ID=315) as a divine innate spell through the telepathic link at will; the squire treats its degree of success as one step worse. If the graveknight's main armor is destroyed, the squire's piece expands to cover the squire's body over 1d10 days, after which point it becomes the graveknight's new body. The graveknight can have only one squire at a time, and must recover the gifted piece of armor if it wishes to create a new squire.<br /> **Dark Deliverance** The graveknight has positive resistance equal to its level. \n\n### Pathfinder #172: Secrets of the Temple City\n**Channel Magic** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> The graveknight redirects magical energies through its armor, allowing it to deliver magic through an attack. The graveknight Casts a Spell that takes 1 or 2 actions to cast and requires a spell attack roll. The effects of the spell don't occur immediately but are imbued into an attack instead. The graveknight then makes a melee Strike with a weapon or [unarmed](/Traits.aspx?ID=199) attack. The spell is coupled with the attack, using the attack roll result to determine the effects of both the Strike and the spell. This counts as two attacks for the graveknight's multiple attack penalty but doesn't apply the penalty until after it's completed Channeling Magic. The graveknight can't use Channel Magic again for 1d4 rounds.\n\n### Book Of The Dead\n <br /> **Clutching Armor** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> ([arcane](/Traits.aspx?ID=11), [transmutation](/Traits.aspx?ID=157)) **Trigger** A creature attempts to move away from the graveknight; **Effect** The graveknight's armor animates and attempts to Grab the triggering creature. It makes an [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) check to [Grapple](/Actions.aspx?ID=35) using the graveknight's Athletics modifier – 2. The armor can continue to Grapple the creature normally. Since the armor is grappling the creature, the graveknight doesn't need a free hand to do so.<br />**Eager for Battle** ([fortune](/Traits.aspx?ID=76)) When the graveknight rolls initiative, they roll twice and take the better result. They're [quickened](/Conditions.aspx?ID=32) during their first round after rolling initiative and can use this extra action to Step, Stride, or Strike.<br /> **Empty Save for Dust** The graveknight's armor contains nothing more than swirling dust that puffs out from joints in their armor. A living creature that touches or is touched by the graveknight (including one hit by the graveknight's fist Strike) must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or become contaminated with the dust. While contaminated, the targeted creature is [stupefied 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=37) and gains weakness to the graveknight's energy damage equal to half the graveknight's level. The contamination ends after 1 minute or when the creature is doused with water, whichever occurs first. <br />**Graveknight's Shield** ([arcane](/Traits.aspx?ID=11), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) The graveknight's curse extends to their shield, or the graveknight's armor uses a portion of itself to produce a shield. The graveknight has a shield that uses the statistics of a [_sturdy shield_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=327) of a level no higher than the graveknight's level – 1. The shield is quasi-independent of the graveknight and automatically protects the graveknight from harm. When the shield is raised, it automatically uses [Shield Block](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=32) to reduce the damage of the first attack against the graveknight each round without the graveknight needing to spend their reaction to do so. The shield automatically rejuvenates with the rest of the graveknight and must be destroyed in the same manner as the graveknight's armor.<br />**Portentous Glare** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61), [fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=68), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=163)) 30 feet. The graveknight's visage is one of overwhelming menace. When a creature ends its turn in the aura, it must attempt a Will saving throw. A creature that fails is [doomed 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=9) (or doomed 1 and [frightened 2](/Conditions.aspx?ID=19) on a critical failure). The graveknight can activate or deactivate the aura by using an Interact action to open or close their helmet visor.\n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Graveknight Armor</title> Wearing graveknight armor is very risky, for the graveknight's essence rapidly parasitizes the new wearer, accelerating the graveknight's rejuvenation. This agonizing transformation inevitably kills the host, transforming their flesh into the graveknight's new body. Removing the curse allows a character to remove the armor, but if it ever wears the armor again, the curse returns. If the wearer dies from another cause while wearing the armor, or if the graveknight's rejuvenation completes before the wearer dies from the curse, the wearer immediately progresses to stage 3.<br /> **Graveknight's Curse** ([arcane](/Traits.aspx?ID=11), [curse](/Traits.aspx?ID=38), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) This curse affects anyone who wears a graveknight's armor for at least 1 hour. **Saving Throw** Will save; **Onset** 1 hour; **Stage 1** doomed 1 and cannot remove the armor (1 day); **Stage 2** doomed 2, hampered 10, and cannot remove the armor (1 day); **Stage 3** dies and transforms into the armor's graveknight.","name":"Graveknight","rarity":"common","release_date":"2021-10-13","resistance":{},"search_markdown":"<additional-info>\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #172: Secrets of the Temple City](/Sources.aspx?ID=102) pg. 82</row>\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nWhen a fearsome combatant falls in battle, the warrior's vengeful spirit can sometimes fuse with their armor, creating a graveknight.

Every graveknight is born of a unique warrior and has a unique fighting style and array of abilities that speak to their techniques in life. Members Graveknight (Creature 10), Graveknight Captain (Creature 6), Graveknight Champion (Creature 15), Graveknight Warmaster (Creature 14) Arts of War Graveknights don't arise from mere soldiers but from great tacticians who've won countless engagements. Often, they were once their land's mightiest general or most decorated war hero. This means graveknights don't just rush into a toe-to-toe melee. They've studied the land (often with the experienced and unrelenting gaze only the undead can bring to bear) and engineered troop movements, earthworks, and traps to ensure victory. They usually have reinforcements ready to deploy and redundant contingencies in place. Just as great strategists opine that an engagement is decided before the first blow is landed, a combat against a graveknight often feels like a desperate fight in a rapidly closing vise. Infamous Graveknights Several of Golarion's most notorious villains are graveknights. The following examples are among the world's most infamous graveknights at large, and may inspire or serve as villains in your own games. Lictor Shokneir: Once the Hellknight leader of the notorious Order of the Crux, Lictor Shokneir was disgraced when he refused a royal order to disband his army of butchers. The other Hellknights surrounded him and razed his castle, Citadel Gheisteno, to the ground. However, Shokneir's determination sustains his now-undead form, and he and his undead legions have rebuilt the citadel in all its haunting glory. The Black Prince: Although the graveknight known simply as the Black Prince was redeemed centuries ago as part of Iomedae's 11 Acts, it is said that the prince's armor remains intact—and that vile forces conspire to reclaim it. If the armor is donned by one of the Black Prince's descendants, the Inner Sea will be beset by a terrible villain indeed. Other Powers You can use the alternate abilities as examples to create new powers reflecting a graveknight's personality or history, or even swap out more than one power. Graveknights should be unique and memorable foes. Steed Adaptations For some graveknights, their mount is more than a projection of their desire to move quickly around a battlefield. A graveknight's phantom steed might have the appearance, resistances, or movement of a favored mount the knight rode as a mortal, such as a nightmare's resistance to fire or a pegasus's Fly Speed. Unique Destruction While most graveknight armors can be destroyed with the standard means of destruction, particularly powerful graveknights might have more durable armor that requires additional steps to destroy. These are usually the armors of high-level graveknights, and their destruction steps are tied to the creation of the graveknight. For example, a specific graveknight armor can't be destroyed until it's struck by a descendant of the person that originally felled the graveknight in battle before their transformation. Creating Graveknights You can turn an existing, living creature into a graveknight by completing the following steps. It's best to build a graveknight from scratch, but if you don't have the time, simply apply the template. A creature should be at least level 5 before being converted to a graveknight. Increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. Increase its attack rolls, AC, saving throws, Perception, and skills by 1, its HP by 5, and its Strike damage by 1. Graveknight Abilities A graveknight gains the undead and graveknight traits, and its alignment is usually adjusted to evil. It loses any abilities that come from it being a living creature and any traits that represent its life, such as human and humanoid. Darkvision Negative Healing Rejuvenation (divine, necromancy) When a graveknight is destroyed, its armor rebuilds its body over the course of 1d10 days—or more quickly if the armor is worn by a living host (see Graveknight Armor, below). If the body is destroyed before then, the process restarts. A graveknight can only be permanently destroyed by obliterating its armor (such as with disintegrate), transporting it to the Positive Energy Plane, or throwing it into the heart of a volcano. Immunities death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, precision, unconscious, plus one energy type (the same chosen for ruinous weapons below). Sacrilegious Aura (abjuration, aura, divine, evil) 30 feet. When a creature in the aura uses a positive spell or ability, the graveknight automatically attempts to counteract it, with the listed counteract modifier. Devastating Blast Two Actions (arcane, evocation) The graveknight unleashes a 30-foot cone of energy. Creatures in the area take 1d12 damage, plus an additional 1d12 damage for every two levels the graveknight has (basic Reflex save). The graveknight can use this ability once every 1d4 rounds. This energy damage is of the same type as that of its ruinous weapons (see below); Devastating Blast gains the associated energy trait. Phantom Mount Three Actions (arcane, conjuration, summon) The graveknight summons a supernatural mount as per phantom steed , heightened to a level equal to half the graveknight's level. Unlike phantom steed , the steed's AC and saving throw bonuses are all 4 lower than the graveknight's, and the steed has one-third the graveknight's Hit Points (rounded down). If the steed is destroyed, the graveknight must wait 1 hour before using this ability again. Ruinous Weapons At the time of its creation, a graveknight chooses one of the following energy types that was relevant to its life or death: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. Any weapon the graveknight wields gains the effects of the corrosive , frost , shock , or flaming weapon rune, respectively, in addition to a +1 striking weapon rune. If the graveknight is 14th level or higher, its weapons instead gain the effects of the greater versions of both of these runes. Weapon Master The graveknight has access to the critical specialization effects of any weapons it wields. Alternate Graveknight Abilities You can create a more unusual graveknight by substituting one of their abilities (except for darkvision, negative healing, rejuvenation, or immunities) with one of the following. ### Bestiary Betrayed Revivification The graveknight died after being deeply betrayed. Instead of being immune to a type of energy damage, it is immune to mental damage, its weapons deal 1d6 additional mental damage, and its Devastating Blast deals mental damage with a Will saving throw instead of Reflex. Create Grave Squire The graveknight can gift a piece of its armor to a willing ally, which becomes its grave squire. The graveknight can communicate telepathically with its squire at any distance, see through the squire's senses, and cast suggestion as a divine innate spell through the telepathic link at will; the squire treats its degree of success as one step worse. If the graveknight's main armor is destroyed, the squire's piece expands to cover the squire's body over 1d10 days, after which point it becomes the graveknight's new body. The graveknight can have only one squire at a time, and must recover the gifted piece of armor if it wishes to create a new squire. Dark Deliverance The graveknight has positive resistance equal to its level. ### Pathfinder #172: Secrets of the Temple City Channel Magic Two Actions The graveknight redirects magical energies through its armor, allowing it to deliver magic through an attack. The graveknight Casts a Spell that takes 1 or 2 actions to cast and requires a spell attack roll. The effects of the spell don't occur immediately but are imbued into an attack instead. The graveknight then makes a melee Strike with a weapon or unarmed attack. The spell is coupled with the attack, using the attack roll result to determine the effects of both the Strike and the spell. This counts as two attacks for the graveknight's multiple attack penalty but doesn't apply the penalty until after it's completed Channeling Magic. The graveknight can't use Channel Magic again for 1d4 rounds. ### Book Of The Dead Clutching Armor Reaction (arcane, transmutation) Trigger A creature attempts to move away from the graveknight; Effect The graveknight's armor animates and attempts to Grab the triggering creature. It makes an Athletics check to Grapple using the graveknight's Athletics modifier – 2. The armor can continue to Grapple the creature normally. Since the armor is grappling the creature, the graveknight doesn't need a free hand to do so. Eager for Battle (fortune) When the graveknight rolls initiative, they roll twice and take the better result. They're quickened during their first round after rolling initiative and can use this extra action to Step, Stride, or Strike. Empty Save for Dust The graveknight's armor contains nothing more than swirling dust that puffs out from joints in their armor. A living creature that touches or is touched by the graveknight (including one hit by the graveknight's fist Strike) must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or become contaminated with the dust. While contaminated, the targeted creature is stupefied 1 and gains weakness to the graveknight's energy damage equal to half the graveknight's level. The contamination ends after 1 minute or when the creature is doused with water, whichever occurs first. Graveknight's Shield (arcane, necromancy) The graveknight's curse extends to their shield, or the graveknight's armor uses a portion of itself to produce a shield. The graveknight has a shield that uses the statistics of a sturdy shield of a level no higher than the graveknight's level – 1. The shield is quasi-independent of the graveknight and automatically protects the graveknight from harm. When the shield is raised, it automatically uses Shield Block to reduce the damage of the first attack against the graveknight each round without the graveknight needing to spend their reaction to do so. The shield automatically rejuvenates with the rest of the graveknight and must be destroyed in the same manner as the graveknight's armor. Portentous Glare (aura, divine, emotion, enchantment, fear, mental, visual) 30 feet. The graveknight's visage is one of overwhelming menace. When a creature ends its turn in the aura, it must attempt a Will saving throw. A creature that fails is doomed 1 (or doomed 1 and frightened 2 on a critical failure). The graveknight can activate or deactivate the aura by using an Interact action to open or close their helmet visor. Graveknight Armor Wearing graveknight armor is very risky, for the graveknight's essence rapidly parasitizes the new wearer, accelerating the graveknight's rejuvenation. This agonizing transformation inevitably kills the host, transforming their flesh into the graveknight's new body. Removing the curse allows a character to remove the armor, but if it ever wears the armor again, the curse returns. If the wearer dies from another cause while wearing the armor, or if the graveknight's rejuvenation completes before the wearer dies from the curse, the wearer immediately progresses to stage 3. Graveknight's Curse (arcane, curse, necromancy) This curse affects anyone who wears a graveknight's armor for at least 1 hour. Saving Throw Will save; Onset 1 hour; Stage 1 doomed 1 and cannot remove the armor (1 day); Stage 2 doomed 2, hampered 10, and cannot remove the armor (1 day); Stage 3 dies and transforms into the armor's graveknight.","type":"Creature Family","url":"/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=291","weakness":{}}},{"_index":"aon18","_id":"creature-family-292","_score":4.166701,"_source":{"breadcrumbs_spa":[],"category":"creature-family","creature_family":"Contemplative of Ashok","creature_family_markdown":"Contemplative of Ashok","exclude_from_search":false,"id":"creature-family-292","markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Creature Family\">[Contemplative of Ashok](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=292)</title>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #173: Doorway to the Red Star](/Sources.aspx?ID=103) pg. 80</row>\n\nThe ancestors of the Contemplatives of Ashok were humanoids of vast intellect who unlocked occult powers.

Building Herexens The herexen presented in the stat block below was originally a cleric of Pharasma, but there are as many kinds of herexens as there are deities. To create a herexen of a different deity, do the following. Swap out the herexen's weapon for the deity's favored weapon.

Swap out the herexen's domain spell for a 1st-level focus spell from a domain associated with that deity. Swap the defiled religious symbol for the correct deity.

Creating a Siabrae A siabrae can be made from any primal spellcaster as long as they have the ability to perform a ritual of undeath as the primary caster (which can usually be performed only by a spellcaster capable of casting 6th-level spells). To create a siabrae, follow these steps: Increase the spellcaster's level by 1 and change their statistics as follows. Increase spell DCs and spell attack rolls by 2.

Although they are capable of feeding on animals, beings of the planes, and other intelligent [undead](/Traits.aspx?ID=160), only the thoughts of an intelligent, living [humanoid](/Traits.aspx?ID=91) bring a vetalarana any sense of satisfaction. Slender and pale, with sunken cheeks and exceptionally long nails, vetalaranas become flushed with color and life after feeding on particularly potent emotions and thoughts, enabling some to pass as living for a short time.\n\n A vetalarana is created when a person with psychic or occult abilities dies in denial of their death, refusing to pass on to the afterlife but unable to retain their grip on life. As their spirit has no cause left undone nor debt to settle, these tenacious souls rise not as ghosts but as vetalaranas, a formidable and tenacious mind animating their own corpse in a mockery of life.\n\n A vetalarana's predations inevitably turn their victims into living husks, incapable of thought and devoid of any spark of personality. These victims fall into a senseless stupor, comatose but still living, without identity or memories. If a vetalarana is killed, they can occupy one of these comatose husks, while more powerful vetalaranas can control them like living puppets.\n\n When a vetalarana is destroyed, all of their comatose victims are immediately freed. Most often, these people regain consciousness as amnesiacs whose memories return over time—taking at least months but sometimes as long as decades. These returned memories are fragmented and often jumbled with the thoughts of others the vetalarana fed upon. If a victim served as a failed host or was frequently controlled while comatose, a sliver of the vetalarana's corrupted thoughts remain in the victim's mind. These tainted victims recover much faster than their fellows, regaining their memories in record time and transforming into a new vetalarana soon after.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Vetalarana Emergent](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1911) (Creature 8), [Vetalarana Manipulator](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1912) (Creature 11)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Mistaken Identity</title>\r\n\r\nConsuming thoughts is an overwhelming sensory experience that requires practice and mental discipline to master.

If the base creature has any abilities that specifically come from being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as [human](/Traits.aspx?ID=90) and [humanoid](/Traits.aspx?ID=91). You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the vetalarana's theme. \n\n **Thoughtsense** ([divination](/Traits.aspx?ID=47), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120)) The vetalarana senses all non-[mindless](/Traits.aspx?ID=108) creatures within 100 feet as a precise sense.\n\n **Negative Healing**\n\n **Immunities** [death](/Traits.aspx?ID=40) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), paralyzed, [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126), [sleep](/Traits.aspx?ID=145)\n\n **Vetalarana Vulnerabilities** All vetalaranas possess the following weaknesses. \n<ul><li>**Barred Senses** A vetalarana can't see or sense through [force](/Traits.aspx?ID=75) effects or [cold iron](/Equipment.aspx?ID=375), and their mind can't penetrate force effects or cold iron. Such barriers can prevent the transference of a vetalarana's mind through Mental Rebirth.</li><li>**Revulsion** A vetalarana delights in consuming memories and secrets, and is disgusted by those who share such sensitive tidbits openly. A vetalarana can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of a creature loudly voicing their intimate personal secrets or most cherished memories aloud. Speaking such information aloud with conviction is a single action that has the [auditory](/Traits.aspx?ID=16), [concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32), and [linguistic](/Traits.aspx?ID=101) traits, and protects the creature until the start of its next turn. A vetalarana that involuntarily comes within 10 feet of a creature sharing such information gains the fleeing condition until they're 10 feet or farther from the creature. After 1 round of being exposed to the secrets of a creature, a vetalarana can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, they overcome their revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success).</li><li>**Vulnerable to Brain Destruction** A vetalarana whose brain has been destroyed, or is reduced to 0 HP while unable to take [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106) actions, can't use Mental Rebirth.</li></ul> **Mental Rebirth** ([curse](/Traits.aspx?ID=38), [incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=93), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117), [occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120)) Unlike most other undead, a vetalarana isn't destroyed when they reach 0 HP. Instead, their body is destroyed, crumbling to ash, and their mind is immediately transferred into a creature they rendered comatose through Drain Thoughts. This creature must be within 1 mile; if no such creature is in range, the vetalarana is destroyed. The creature becomes [controlled](/Conditions.aspx?ID=6) by the vetalarana and loses the [stupefied](/Conditions.aspx?ID=37) and [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38) conditions. If the creature controlled by a vetalarana in this way is killed, the vetalarana's mind transfers to another creature within 1 mile who they rendered comatose through Drain Thoughts.<br /> After 1d6 days of being controlled, the controlled creature dies, and its body transforms into that of the vetalarana who rendered it comatose.\n\n **Climb Speed** A vetalarana gains a climb Speed equal to their land Speed.\n\n**Claws** If the base creature had hands, its fingernails thicken and grow to terrible proportions, granting it an unarmed claw Strike that deals slashing damage, has the [agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170) trait, and can [Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=18). Use the moderate damage for the creature's level on the [Strike Damage](/Rules.aspx?ID=1018) table.\n\n **Drain Thoughts** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([divination](/Traits.aspx?ID=47), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120)) **Requirements** A [grabbed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=20), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [restrained](/Conditions.aspx?ID=33), [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38), or willing creature is within the vetalarana's reach; **Effect** The vetalarana seizes a creature and consumes its memories. This requires an [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions.

These vetalaranas are known as “manipulators,” although those with psychic powers of their own often prefer the terms “doyen” or “thoughtseer.” \n\nVetalarana manipulators gain additional abilities, as detailed below. A creature below 10th level isn't powerful enough to become a vetalarana manipulator; instead, make such a creature into a regular vetalarana or rebuild the creature so that it's at least 10th level before making it a vetalarana manipulator.\n\n **Resistances** The vetalarana manipulator resists [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106) damage and all physical damage (except [magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103) [cold iron](/Equipment.aspx?ID=375)).\n\n **Control Comatose** ([exploration](/Traits.aspx?ID=66), [incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=93), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117), [occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120), [possession](/Traits.aspx?ID=129)) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The vetalarana manipulator spends 10 minutes to take psychic control of the creatures they've rendered comatose with Drain Thoughts.

Although they are capable of feeding on animals, beings of the planes, and other intelligent undead, only the thoughts of an intelligent, living humanoid bring a vetalarana any sense of satisfaction. Slender and pale, with sunken cheeks and exceptionally long nails, vetalaranas become flushed with color and life after feeding on particularly potent emotions and thoughts, enabling some to pass as living for a short time. A vetalarana is created when a person with psychic or occult abilities dies in denial of their death, refusing to pass on to the afterlife but unable to retain their grip on life. As their spirit has no cause left undone nor debt to settle, these tenacious souls rise not as ghosts but as vetalaranas, a formidable and tenacious mind animating their own corpse in a mockery of life. A vetalarana's predations inevitably turn their victims into living husks, incapable of thought and devoid of any spark of personality. These victims fall into a senseless stupor, comatose but still living, without identity or memories. If a vetalarana is killed, they can occupy one of these comatose husks, while more powerful vetalaranas can control them like living puppets. When a vetalarana is destroyed, all of their comatose victims are immediately freed. Most often, these people regain consciousness as amnesiacs whose memories return over time—taking at least months but sometimes as long as decades. These returned memories are fragmented and often jumbled with the thoughts of others the vetalarana fed upon. If a victim served as a failed host or was frequently controlled while comatose, a sliver of the vetalarana's corrupted thoughts remain in the victim's mind. These tainted victims recover much faster than their fellows, regaining their memories in record time and transforming into a new vetalarana soon after. Members Vetalarana Emergent (Creature 8), Vetalarana Manipulator (Creature 11) Mistaken Identity Consuming thoughts is an overwhelming sensory experience that requires practice and mental discipline to master. Newly risen vetalaranas that consume memories too rapidly can lose sight of their identity amid the foreign thoughts in their minds. Consequently, they might return to the wrong home, abduct their prey's family, or adopt the quirks and vices of their victims. Puppeteers Vetalarana manipulators are obsessed with control. They experiment with the minds of the living, manipulating, enhancing, and erasing their victim's memories to see what changes occur. Through these mental experiments, vetalaranas learn how to control minds and lives, twisting mortals into loyal servants or unknowing puppets while erasing any record of their own interference. Thought Connoisseurs While all vetalaranas hunger for the most cherished memories and deepest secrets, vetalarana manipulators use the memories they consume to learn the skills and talents of their prey. Thus, they select their prey with great care. Each has their preferences, depending upon the skills they wish to cultivate, perhaps martial prowess, musical talent, arcane might, or enlightenment. Uses for Cold Iron Canny mortals looking to thwart a vetalarana make heavy use of cold iron. They line their sanctuaries with the material or surround comatose victims in cold iron sheets, armor, or shields. Others weave shrouds of cold iron thread or mix cold iron dust into paints and oils—though the efficacy of the latter is debatable. Vampire Related Families Vampire, Vampire, Jiang-Shi, Vampire, Nosferatu, Vampire, Strigoi, Vampire, Vrykolakas Creating a Vetalarana While it's best to create a vetalarana from scratch, you can turn an existing living creature into a vetalarana using the following steps. Increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. It gains the undead and vampire traits, and usually becomes evil. Increase the creature's AC, attack modifiers, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1. Increase its damage with Strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. If an ability can be used only a small number of times (such as a dragon's Breath Weapon), increase the damage by 2 instead. Reduce its HP by the amount listed on the table. The vetalarana gains fast healing, resistance to mental damage, and resistance to physical damage (except cold iron) as indicated on the table. These abilities are the reason the vetalarana has less HP. ## Vetalarana Statistics Starting Level Starting Level Starting Level 3-4 –20 5 5-7 –30 7 8-14 –40 10 15+ –60 15 Basic Vetalarana Abilities All vetalaranas gain the following abilities. If the base creature has any abilities that specifically come from being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as human and humanoid. You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the vetalarana's theme. Thoughtsense (divination, mental, occult) The vetalarana senses all non-mindless creatures within 100 feet as a precise sense. Negative Healing Immunities death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, sleep Vetalarana Vulnerabilities All vetalaranas possess the following weaknesses. Barred Senses A vetalarana can't see or sense through force effects or cold iron, and their mind can't penetrate force effects or cold iron. Such barriers can prevent the transference of a vetalarana's mind through Mental Rebirth. Revulsion A vetalarana delights in consuming memories and secrets, and is disgusted by those who share such sensitive tidbits openly. A vetalarana can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of a creature loudly voicing their intimate personal secrets or most cherished memories aloud. Speaking such information aloud with conviction is a single action that has the auditory, concentrate, and linguistic traits, and protects the creature until the start of its next turn. A vetalarana that involuntarily comes within 10 feet of a creature sharing such information gains the fleeing condition until they're 10 feet or farther from the creature. After 1 round of being exposed to the secrets of a creature, a vetalarana can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, they overcome their revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success). Vulnerable to Brain Destruction A vetalarana whose brain has been destroyed, or is reduced to 0 HP while unable to take mental actions, can't use Mental Rebirth. Mental Rebirth (curse, incapacitation, mental, necromancy, occult) Unlike most other undead, a vetalarana isn't destroyed when they reach 0 HP. Instead, their body is destroyed, crumbling to ash, and their mind is immediately transferred into a creature they rendered comatose through Drain Thoughts. This creature must be within 1 mile; if no such creature is in range, the vetalarana is destroyed. The creature becomes controlled by the vetalarana and loses the stupefied and unconscious conditions. If the creature controlled by a vetalarana in this way is killed, the vetalarana's mind transfers to another creature within 1 mile who they rendered comatose through Drain Thoughts. After 1d6 days of being controlled, the controlled creature dies, and its body transforms into that of the vetalarana who rendered it comatose. Climb Speed A vetalarana gains a climb Speed equal to their land Speed. Claws If the base creature had hands, its fingernails thicken and grow to terrible proportions, granting it an unarmed claw Strike that deals slashing damage, has the agile trait, and can Grab. Use the moderate damage for the creature's level on the Strike Damage table. Drain Thoughts Single Action (divination, mental, occult) Requirements A grabbed, paralyzed, restrained, unconscious, or willing creature is within the vetalarana's reach; Effect The vetalarana seizes a creature and consumes its memories. This requires an Athletics check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is stupefied 1, and the vetalarana regains HP equal to 10% of the vetalarana's maximum HP, gaining any excess as temporary Hit Points. Draining Thoughts from a creature that is already stupefied doesn't restore any HP to the vetalarana but increases the victim's stupefied value by 1. Additionally, the vetalarana views one of the victim's memories. A victim's stupefied condition value decreases by 1 every week. A victim that becomes stupefied 5 in this way is rendered comatose, becoming permanently unconscious. As long as the vetalarana lives, a comatose victim can't regain consciousness, and its stupefied condition doesn't decrease. Vetalarana Manipulator Abilities Extremely powerful vetalaranas who've tasted the thoughts of hundreds of people or more become empowered by the memories and experiences they've consumed, overcoming their revulsions. They gain greater control over their comatose victims, can manipulate memories, and even paralyze with a touch. These vetalaranas are known as “manipulators,” although those with psychic powers of their own often prefer the terms “doyen” or “thoughtseer.” Vetalarana manipulators gain additional abilities, as detailed below. A creature below 10th level isn't powerful enough to become a vetalarana manipulator; instead, make such a creature into a regular vetalarana or rebuild the creature so that it's at least 10th level before making it a vetalarana manipulator. Resistances The vetalarana manipulator resists mental damage and all physical damage (except magical cold iron). Control Comatose (exploration, incapacitation, mental, necromancy, occult, possession) Frequency once per day; Effect The vetalarana manipulator spends 10 minutes to take psychic control of the creatures they've rendered comatose with Drain Thoughts. This has the effects of the possession spell, but lasts for up to 6 hours, has a range of 1 mile, and the vetalarana can control a number of comatose victims at a time equal to half the vetalarana's level. A comatose victim can't resist this possession and automatically gets a critical failure on its saving throw against Control Comatose. As long as a comatose victim is controlled by a vetalarana manipulator in this way, the victim's stupefied and unconscious conditions are temporarily suppressed. Drain Thoughts Single Action (divination, mental, occult) As a basic vetalarana, but the vetalarana manipulator can choose to alter, enhance, or erase the memory they view as a 4th-level modify memory spell. If the vetalarana gets a critical success on their Athletics check to Drain Thoughts, the target is stupefied 2 instead of stupefied 1. Occult Innate Spells A vetalarana manipulator has tongues as a constant occult innate spell. Paralyzing Claws (incapacitation, occult, necromancy) Any living creature hit by a vetalarana manipulator's claw Strike must succeed at a Fortitude save or become paralyzed. The target can attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns to end the effect, and the DC cumulatively decreases by 1 on each such save.

They predate ancient [nosferatus](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=273) and view [moroi](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=97) as infantile children, yet their own origins are so far lost to the ravages of time that few today have heard of them and fewer still know their true nature. Many of the oldest tales about vampires trace back to the strigoi, and nearly every other vampire carries traits that ultimately have their roots in these powerful, ancient creatures.\n\n Strigoi, in their true form, are bodiless creatures native to the [Shadow Plane](/Planes.aspx?ID=11) that are incapable of interacting with the physical world, existing only as pure forces of malevolence. When this malevolence is invited into a physical body by method of ancient rituals, though, a strigoi becomes much more dangerous. This requirement—that a living creature perform a rite of their own free will to draw the strigoi into their soul—may well be the source of a moroi's compulsion not to enter a home without first being invited.\n\n Some myths point to [Urgathoa](/Deities.aspx?ID=19) as the source of the ritual that allowed spellcasters to become strigoi, while others suggest the method was spread by the cult of [Zura](/Deities.aspx?ID=83). Whatever the source, this long-lost ritual was no gateway to power, but instead a trap that allowed the strigoi to inhabit the shadows and souls of once-living hosts. In so doing, they found a way to exist in the world of flesh and blood. The presence of a strigoi within the shadow of a living host causes sickness and swift death, after which the strigoi bonds with the host's soul and becomes one with the body. Thus did the first of their kind invade the world of the living, and thus did the first vampires walk the night.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Strigoi Progenitor](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1944) (Creature 13)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Strange Wounds</title>\r\n\r\nIconic puncture marks on the neck of a victim drained of blood are well known to vampire hunters, but the wounds left by strigoi are stranger. When a strigoi feeds on a living victim, the site of the wound becomes bleached of color, wrinkled, and strangely cold to the touch. These conditions fade if the wound heals; if a strigoi feeds enough to cause death by the drained condition, a creature leaves behind a withered gray husk of a bloodless body. Full autopsies on those slain in this manner reveal yet another unsettling curiosity: the brains of such victims are smooth, gray ovoids, the folds and fissures of gray matter fused together into a featureless mass.\r\n\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Strigoi and the Sun</title>\r\n\r\nAs long as they're not in shadow form, strigoi are more inconvenienced by sunlight than they are harmed by it, but being rendered [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38) certainly puts them at a disadvantage. As long as they're in an area where there's little risk of direct sunlight, such as being inside a room without exterior windows or doors, or in an underground area, some strigoi remain active during the day, only retreating to their coffins in emergencies.

You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the strigoi's theme.\n\n[**Greater Darkvision**](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)\n\n[**Negative Healing**](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=42)\n\n**Immunities** [death](/Traits.aspx?ID=40) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), paralyze, [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126), [sleep](/Traits.aspx?ID=145) **Coffin Restoration** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117), [negative](/Traits.aspx?ID=118)) As with moroi vampires, a strigoi isn't destroyed at 0 HP. Instead, it falls [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38) and loses fast healing. If its body rests in its coffin for 1 hour, the strigoi gains 1 HP, after which its fast healing begins to function normally.\n\n**Strigoi Weaknesses** All strigoi possess the following weaknesses:\n<ul><li>**Revulsion** Strigoi are uncomfortable near mirrors or sources of bright light. Only a strigoi's shadow reflects in a mirror, and this often compels them to cover or destroy mirrors in their presence rather than risk their true nature being displayed. A strigoi can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or source of bright light. To brandish a mirror or light source, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to [Raising a Shield](/Actions.aspx?ID=98)). If the strigoi involuntarily comes within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or light source, it gains the [fleeing](/Conditions.aspx?ID=17) condition, running from the brandished object until it ends an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of its revulsion, a strigoi can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the [concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32) trait. On a success, it overcomes its revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success). A strigoi can move normally around mirrors or bright light sources that are not brandished, although doing so causes them discomfort that can be noticed with a successful Perception check to [Sense Motive](/Actions.aspx?ID=85).</li><li>**Sunlight** When exposed to direct sunlight, a strigoi immediately becomes unconscious and falls to the ground. It appears to be dead: it doesn't breathe, its body temperature matches its surroundings, and it doesn't react to pain or other stimuli. A successful Perception check against the strigoi's Reflex DC is enough to note one anomaly: the shadow cast by its “dead” body shifts and moves slightly, its edges twisting and active. Spells like [_detect evil_](/Spells.aspx?ID=65), senses like [lifesense](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=21), and the “corpse” taking damage from [positive](/Traits.aspx?ID=128) energy still function normally, and could reveal the truth without needing a successful Perception check. Viewing the “corpse” in a mirror's reflection can also reveal the truth, for only the body's shadow reflects. While in sunlight and unconscious, the strigoi loses its resistance to physical damage. If the strigoi takes enough damage that it would be reduced to 0 Hit Points, its body quickly decomposes, and the strigoi is destroyed.</li><li>**Water Revulsion** A strigoi cannot cross a significant source of running water (such as a creek, river, or waves on a seashore). A strigoi capable of flight can cross running water provided it approaches no closer than 10 feet to the liquid's surface. If forced into running water against its will, the strigoi becomes [slowed 2](/Conditions.aspx?ID=35) and gains the [fleeing](/Conditions.aspx?ID=17) condition as long as it remains in the water. At the end of any turn in which the strigoi remains in running water, it must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or be destroyed.</li></ul>**Levitation** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [evocation](/Traits.aspx?ID=65), [shadow](/Traits.aspx?ID=143)) Strigoi can cast [_levitate_](/Spells.aspx?ID=170) at will as a divine innate spell; when they do so, they appear to ascend or descend on a coiling mass of shadows.\n\n**Claws** If the creature had hands, its shadow solidifies around the fingers when it attacks, granting it a claw Strike that deals slashing damage, and has the [agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170) and [magic](/Traits.aspx?ID=103) traits. The damage caused by its claws should be roughly the same as the [moderate Strike damage for a creature of its level](/Rules.aspx?ID=1018).\n\n**Drink Essence** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) **Requirements** A [grabbed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=20), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [restrained](/Conditions.aspx?ID=33), [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38), or willing creature is within the strigoi's reach; **Effect** The strigoi sinks their fangs into the targeted creature to drink its blood and draw out its vital essence. This requires an [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) check against the creature's Fortitude DC if the creature is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The creature becomes [drained 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=10) and [stupefied 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=37), and the strigoi regains HP equal to 10% of their maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Essence from a creature that's already drained or stupefied doesn't restore any HP, but increases either the creature's drained condition value or its stupefied condition value by 1 (whichever value is lesser is increased; if both values are equal, then the strigoi chooses which condition to increase the value of).<br /> A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes.<br /> A victim's stupefied condition decreases by 1 per day after performing daily preparations. If the daily preparations are done in full sunlight, the stupefied condition is removed entirely.\n\n**Grab** The creature's claw attacks gain [Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=18). When it uses this ability, its shadowy claws seem almost to latch on to any shadows cast by the grabbed creature.\n\n**Shadow Form** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [shadow](/Traits.aspx?ID=143), [transmutation](/Traits.aspx?ID=157)) The strigoi reverts to pure shadow and absorbs its body and its gear into the darkness, or it shifts back to its physical form. In shadow form, the strigoi gains a climb Speed equal to its land Speed and can move through any gap that isn't airtight. However, it can only move along solid surfaces that aren't highly reflective, not liquid or mirrored surfaces. If the surface it's on is destroyed, the strigoi returns to physical form and is [stunned 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=36). The strigoi loses fast healing while in shadow form but can remain in shadow form indefinitely.<br /> A strigoi that is exposed to sunlight while in shadow form becomes slowed 2 and must attempt a DC 16 flat check at the end of each of its turns. If it fails this flat check, it is destroyed, the shadow vanishing with a blood-curdling wail. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Strigoi Progenitor Abilities</title> Powerful strigoi that form from the fusion of a strigoi from the Shadow Plane and a living host gain additional abilities as detailed below. A creature below level 13 is not a significant enough host to become a strigoi progenitor.\n\n**Resistances** The strigoi progenitor resists all physical damage except magical silver weapons or magical weapons that shed at least 5 feet of bright light.\n\n**Fly Speed** Instead of being able to _levitate_ at will, a strigoi progenitor gains a fly Speed equal to their land Speed. When a strigoi progenitor flies, it manifests batlike wings made of shadow.\n\n**Create Spawn** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [downtime](/Traits.aspx?ID=49), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) If a creature dies after being reduced to 0 HP by Domain of Dusk or Drink Essence, the strigoi can turn this victim into a vampire by donating some of its own blood to the victim and burying the victim in earth for 3 nights. If the new vampire is lower level than its creator, it is under the creator's control. A victim that is 8th level or higher becomes a strigoi servant, while a lower-level victim instead becomes a moroi vampire. If a vampire controls too many spawn at once (as determined by the GM), strong-willed spawn can free themselves by succeeding at a Will saving throw against the vampire's Will DC.\n\n**Shadow Escape** <actions string=\"Free Action\" /> **Trigger** The strigoi is reduced to 0 HP; **Effect** The strigoi uses Shadow Form. It can take move actions to move toward its coffin even though it's at 0 HP. While at 0 HP in this form, the strigoi is unaffected by further damage. Once the strigoi reaches its coffin, or if it hasn't done so within 2 hours, it automatically returns to its physical form, unconscious.\n\n**Domain of Dusk** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([conjuration](/Traits.aspx?ID=33), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [shadow](/Traits.aspx?ID=143)) With a wave of its hand, the strigoi calls fourth vile ruination from the surrounding shadows, causing coils of darkness and shadowy bats, rats, and wolves to lash out at living targets in a 30-foot emanation. Living creatures in this area take 1d6 negative damage +1d6 per 2 levels possessed by the strigoi ([basic](/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Fortitude save against the [DC of the strigoi's level](/Rules.aspx?ID=554)). A creature that fails this save is also [dazzled](/Conditions.aspx?ID=7) for 1 round (or [blinded](/Conditions.aspx?ID=1) for 1 round and then dazzled for 1 round) by the darkness. The strigoi progenitor can't use Domain of Dusk for 1 minute.\n\n**Dominate** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61), [incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=93), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=163)) The vampire can cast [_dominate_](/Spells.aspx?ID=87) at will as a divine innate spell. Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the [visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=163) trait. The save DC uses the DC of the vampire's level, and a creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that vampire's Dominate for 24 hours. Fully destroying the vampire ends the domination, but merely reducing the vampire to 0 HP is insufficient to break the spell. \n\n**Drink Essence** As a typical strigoi, but the victim is drained 2 and stupefied 2 instead of 1.","name":"Vampire, Strigoi","rarity":"common","release_date":"2022-05-25","resistance":{},"search_markdown":"<additional-info>\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Shadows at Sundown](/Sources.aspx?ID=121) pg. 60</row>\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nThe oldest of all vampires are the strigoi.

They predate ancient nosferatus and view moroi as infantile children, yet their own origins are so far lost to the ravages of time that few today have heard of them and fewer still know their true nature. Many of the oldest tales about vampires trace back to the strigoi, and nearly every other vampire carries traits that ultimately have their roots in these powerful, ancient creatures. Strigoi, in their true form, are bodiless creatures native to the Shadow Plane that are incapable of interacting with the physical world, existing only as pure forces of malevolence. When this malevolence is invited into a physical body by method of ancient rituals, though, a strigoi becomes much more dangerous. This requirement—that a living creature perform a rite of their own free will to draw the strigoi into their soul—may well be the source of a moroi's compulsion not to enter a home without first being invited. Some myths point to Urgathoa as the source of the ritual that allowed spellcasters to become strigoi, while others suggest the method was spread by the cult of Zura. Whatever the source, this long-lost ritual was no gateway to power, but instead a trap that allowed the strigoi to inhabit the shadows and souls of once-living hosts. In so doing, they found a way to exist in the world of flesh and blood. The presence of a strigoi within the shadow of a living host causes sickness and swift death, after which the strigoi bonds with the host's soul and becomes one with the body. Thus did the first of their kind invade the world of the living, and thus did the first vampires walk the night. Members Strigoi Progenitor (Creature 13) Strange Wounds Iconic puncture marks on the neck of a victim drained of blood are well known to vampire hunters, but the wounds left by strigoi are stranger. When a strigoi feeds on a living victim, the site of the wound becomes bleached of color, wrinkled, and strangely cold to the touch. These conditions fade if the wound heals; if a strigoi feeds enough to cause death by the drained condition, a creature leaves behind a withered gray husk of a bloodless body. Full autopsies on those slain in this manner reveal yet another unsettling curiosity: the brains of such victims are smooth, gray ovoids, the folds and fissures of gray matter fused together into a featureless mass. Strigoi and the Sun As long as they're not in shadow form, strigoi are more inconvenienced by sunlight than they are harmed by it, but being rendered unconscious certainly puts them at a disadvantage. As long as they're in an area where there's little risk of direct sunlight, such as being inside a room without exterior windows or doors, or in an underground area, some strigoi remain active during the day, only retreating to their coffins in emergencies. In so doing, these strigoi have further blended into society—there may be more of them than suspected! Strigoi Servants When a strigoi creates a spawn from a creature that's not powerful enough to play host to a strigoi progenitor, the resulting strigoi is often referred to simply as a strigoi servant. Statistics for a typical strigoi servant appear on page 25 of this adventure. Strigoi servants who escape servitude work hard to establish their own power, but rarely escape the mindset of existing only to serve their creator. Vampire Related Families Vampire, Vampire, Jiang-Shi, Vampire, Nosferatu, Vampire, Vetalarana, Vampire, Vrykolakas Creating a Strigoi A creature of 8th to 12th level can become a strigoi servant (see page 25 of this adventure for the typical statistics for a strigoi servant); only 13th-level or higher creatures can become strigoi progenitors. A creature below 8th level infected by a strigoi becomes a free-willed moroi vampire instead (indeed, it is from this method the first moroi eventually came into the world). You can turn an existing living creature into a strigoi using the following steps. Increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows: It gains the shadow, undead, and vampire traits, and almost always becomes evil. Increase AC, attack bonuses, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1. Increase damage with Strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. If an ability can be used only a small number of times, increase the damage by 2 instead. The strigoi gains fast healing and resistance to all physical damage except from silver weapons or weapons that shed at least 5 feet of bright light (such as a lit torch or a weapon targeted by the light spell, but not a flaming weapon) based on the table below. These abilities are the reason the strigoi has fewer HP. ## Strigoi Statistics Starting Level HP Decrease Fast Healing/Resistance 8-14 -40 10 15+ -60 15 Basic Strigoi Abilities All strigoi gain the following abilities. If the base creature has any abilities that specifically come from it being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as human and humanoid. You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the strigoi's theme. Greater Darkvision Negative Healing Immunities death effects, disease, paralyze, poison, sleep Coffin Restoration (divine, necromancy, negative) As with moroi vampires, a strigoi isn't destroyed at 0 HP. Instead, it falls unconscious and loses fast healing. If its body rests in its coffin for 1 hour, the strigoi gains 1 HP, after which its fast healing begins to function normally. Strigoi Weaknesses All strigoi possess the following weaknesses: Revulsion Strigoi are uncomfortable near mirrors or sources of bright light. Only a strigoi's shadow reflects in a mirror, and this often compels them to cover or destroy mirrors in their presence rather than risk their true nature being displayed. A strigoi can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or source of bright light. To brandish a mirror or light source, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the strigoi involuntarily comes within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or light source, it gains the fleeing condition, running from the brandished object until it ends an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of its revulsion, a strigoi can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, it overcomes its revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success). A strigoi can move normally around mirrors or bright light sources that are not brandished, although doing so causes them discomfort that can be noticed with a successful Perception check to Sense Motive. Sunlight When exposed to direct sunlight, a strigoi immediately becomes unconscious and falls to the ground. It appears to be dead: it doesn't breathe, its body temperature matches its surroundings, and it doesn't react to pain or other stimuli. A successful Perception check against the strigoi's Reflex DC is enough to note one anomaly: the shadow cast by its “dead” body shifts and moves slightly, its edges twisting and active. Spells like detect evil , senses like lifesense, and the “corpse” taking damage from positive energy still function normally, and could reveal the truth without needing a successful Perception check. Viewing the “corpse” in a mirror's reflection can also reveal the truth, for only the body's shadow reflects. While in sunlight and unconscious, the strigoi loses its resistance to physical damage. If the strigoi takes enough damage that it would be reduced to 0 Hit Points, its body quickly decomposes, and the strigoi is destroyed. Water Revulsion A strigoi cannot cross a significant source of running water (such as a creek, river, or waves on a seashore). A strigoi capable of flight can cross running water provided it approaches no closer than 10 feet to the liquid's surface. If forced into running water against its will, the strigoi becomes slowed 2 and gains the fleeing condition as long as it remains in the water. At the end of any turn in which the strigoi remains in running water, it must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or be destroyed. Levitation Two Actions (divine, evocation, shadow) Strigoi can cast levitate at will as a divine innate spell; when they do so, they appear to ascend or descend on a coiling mass of shadows. Claws If the creature had hands, its shadow solidifies around the fingers when it attacks, granting it a claw Strike that deals slashing damage, and has the agile and magic traits. The damage caused by its claws should be roughly the same as the moderate Strike damage for a creature of its level. Drink Essence Single Action (divine, necromancy) Requirements A grabbed, paralyzed, restrained, unconscious, or willing creature is within the strigoi's reach; Effect The strigoi sinks their fangs into the targeted creature to drink its blood and draw out its vital essence. This requires an Athletics check against the creature's Fortitude DC if the creature is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The creature becomes drained 1 and stupefied 1, and the strigoi regains HP equal to 10% of their maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Essence from a creature that's already drained or stupefied doesn't restore any HP, but increases either the creature's drained condition value or its stupefied condition value by 1 (whichever value is lesser is increased; if both values are equal, then the strigoi chooses which condition to increase the value of). A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes. A victim's stupefied condition decreases by 1 per day after performing daily preparations. If the daily preparations are done in full sunlight, the stupefied condition is removed entirely. Grab The creature's claw attacks gain Grab. When it uses this ability, its shadowy claws seem almost to latch on to any shadows cast by the grabbed creature. Shadow Form Single Action (concentrate, divine, shadow, transmutation) The strigoi reverts to pure shadow and absorbs its body and its gear into the darkness, or it shifts back to its physical form. In shadow form, the strigoi gains a climb Speed equal to its land Speed and can move through any gap that isn't airtight. However, it can only move along solid surfaces that aren't highly reflective, not liquid or mirrored surfaces. If the surface it's on is destroyed, the strigoi returns to physical form and is stunned 1. The strigoi loses fast healing while in shadow form but can remain in shadow form indefinitely. A strigoi that is exposed to sunlight while in shadow form becomes slowed 2 and must attempt a DC 16 flat check at the end of each of its turns. If it fails this flat check, it is destroyed, the shadow vanishing with a blood-curdling wail. Strigoi Progenitor Abilities Powerful strigoi that form from the fusion of a strigoi from the Shadow Plane and a living host gain additional abilities as detailed below. A creature below level 13 is not a significant enough host to become a strigoi progenitor. Resistances The strigoi progenitor resists all physical damage except magical silver weapons or magical weapons that shed at least 5 feet of bright light. Fly Speed Instead of being able to levitate at will, a strigoi progenitor gains a fly Speed equal to their land Speed. When a strigoi progenitor flies, it manifests batlike wings made of shadow. Create Spawn (divine, downtime, necromancy) If a creature dies after being reduced to 0 HP by Domain of Dusk or Drink Essence, the strigoi can turn this victim into a vampire by donating some of its own blood to the victim and burying the victim in earth for 3 nights. If the new vampire is lower level than its creator, it is under the creator's control. A victim that is 8th level or higher becomes a strigoi servant, while a lower-level victim instead becomes a moroi vampire. If a vampire controls too many spawn at once (as determined by the GM), strong-willed spawn can free themselves by succeeding at a Will saving throw against the vampire's Will DC. Shadow Escape Free Action Trigger The strigoi is reduced to 0 HP; Effect The strigoi uses Shadow Form. It can take move actions to move toward its coffin even though it's at 0 HP. While at 0 HP in this form, the strigoi is unaffected by further damage. Once the strigoi reaches its coffin, or if it hasn't done so within 2 hours, it automatically returns to its physical form, unconscious. Domain of Dusk Two Actions (conjuration, divine, shadow) With a wave of its hand, the strigoi calls fourth vile ruination from the surrounding shadows, causing coils of darkness and shadowy bats, rats, and wolves to lash out at living targets in a 30-foot emanation. Living creatures in this area take 1d6 negative damage +1d6 per 2 levels possessed by the strigoi (basic Fortitude save against the DC of the strigoi's level). A creature that fails this save is also dazzled for 1 round (or blinded for 1 round and then dazzled for 1 round) by the darkness. The strigoi progenitor can't use Domain of Dusk for 1 minute. Dominate Two Actions (divine, enchantment, incapacitation, mental, visual) The vampire can cast dominate at will as a divine innate spell. Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the visual trait. The save DC uses the DC of the vampire's level, and a creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that vampire's Dominate for 24 hours. Fully destroying the vampire ends the domination, but merely reducing the vampire to 0 HP is insufficient to break the spell.

The physiological effects of this exposure vary in scope from grotesque full-body transformations to more subtle changes to the skin or senses, and they're frequently accompanied by changes in disposition, motivation, or temperament. Members Mutant Desert Drake (Creature 9), Mutant Giant Toad (Creature 3), Mutant Gnoll Hulk (Creature 9) Aberrant, not Ableist! The trope of the mutant is a common one in speculative fiction but often draws deeply on concepts that fear and mock anyone with an appearance that falls outside of a perceived norm. When creating a mutant, be careful to avoid any traits that might match real-world deformities or disabilities that people might have—a giant wolf mouth in the middle of a mutant's stomach is okay, but having a simple withered limb or a swollen face might be inappropriate for a mutant character. Creating Mutants In most cases, it's better to build a new Mana Wastes mutant from the ground up, using the standard rules for monster creation (this is how the mutants presented here were built). An existing creature can be turned into a Mana Wastes mutant by increasing its level (generally by 1 or 2), increasing its statistics accordingly, and giving it one or more of the Mana Wastes mutant abilities on this page. Mana Wastes Mutant Communities Rumors circulate in Alkenstar of mutant settlements deep in the Mana Wastes. In these settlements, mutants have reportedly banded together for survival in the harsh environment, though accounts differ on whether such communities welcome and shelter lost travelers or eliminate non-mutants who stumble upon them. Other Mutants The Mana Wastes are notorious for the production of mutants but the strange energies of the Spellscar Desert are far from the only things that can transform a creature into a mutant. You can use the rules for creating a Mana Wastes mutant to create any sort of mutated creature, such as might occur after exposure to otherworldly radiation in Numeria, succumbing to planar effects from a chaotic outer plane, imbibing a potent mutagen like the notorious milk of Lamashtu, or suffering potent side effects from a ritual gone catastrophically wrong Mana Wastes Mutant Abilities All Mana Wastes mutants gain darkvision (replacing low-light vision if the creature had it), and the DC to Recall Knowledge about a mutant increases by 2. The creature gains the mutant trait. They usually have one or two of the following abilities, or potentially three if the mutant is 9th level or higher. If you apply these abilities to an existing creature, either raise the level and adjust the statistics, or remove some of the creature's abilities to make room for the new abilities. Select two of the following abilities, or potentially three if the Mana Wastes mutant is 9th level or higher. These abilities should relate to the manner that the base creature used magic in life or to the nature of the wild magic that caused their mutation. You can also create new abilities or adapt others from monsters or classes to fit the theme. Lost Omens Impossible Lands Source Impossible Lands pg. 332 Caustic Pustules Whenever the mutant takes piercing or slashing damage, creatures adjacent to the mutant take 1d6 acid damage (basic Reflex save). The damage increases to 2d6 if the mutant is at least 8th level and 3d6 if the mutant is at least 15th level. Chameleon Skin The mutant can change their coloration to match their surroundings. They don't need cover or concealment to attempt to Hide with a Stealth check. Eldritch Attraction (enchantment, mental) A creature who casts a spell within 30 feet of the mutant must succeed at a Will save or spend its next action to Stride toward the mutant. It can't Delay or take any reactions until it has obeyed the compulsion. Energy Blast two-actions] ([evocation, primal) Choose an energy type; this ability gains that energy type as a trait. The mutant gains some sort of physical alteration to their shape that suggests how they trigger their energy blast, be it numerous pustules on their body, an extra limb, or an additional opening in their throat to exhale the blast as a breath weapon. Choose whether the mutant creates a 60-foot line of energy or a 30-foot cone of energy when they activate this ability. The energy deals 1d6 damage per level with a basic Reflex save. The mutant can't use Energy Blast again for 1d4 rounds. Energy Resistance The mutant has strangely colored skin or fur and gains resistance to a single type of energy damage. The amount of energy resistance gained depends on the mutant's level. ## Mutant Energy Resistance Mutant's Level Energy Resistance 2 or lower 2 3–7 5 8–14 10 15+ 15 Grasping Tentacle The mutant grows a writhing, serpentine appendage, granting them a tentacle Strike (an agile unarmed attack that deals bludgeoning damage), and the Grab ability with that Strike. If they had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by their tentacle should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If they had only non-agile attacks, their tentacle should deal three-quarters that damage. Hulking Form Increase the mutant's size by one category. Decrease their AC by 1, increase their HP by 1/10 their normal maximum HP, and increase the reach of all their melee Strikes by 5 feet. Hungry Maw A mouth full of razor-sharp teeth opens somewhere on the mutant's body. They gain a maw Strike (an unarmed attack that does piercing damage roughly the same as the damage dealt by their most damaging melee attack), and they gain the Vengeful Bite reaction. Vengeful Bite Reaction Trigger A creature critically hits the mutant with a melee unarmed Strike or a non-reach melee Strike ; Effect The mutant makes a maw Strike against the triggering creature. Increased Speed The mutant's limbs change, or they grow new limbs to accommodate their mutation. Either one of their existing Speeds increases by 20 feet or they gain a new Speed (such as fly or swim) of 15 feet. Magic Hunger The mutant gains the ability to detect the source of any magic within 30 feet as an imprecise sense. Mirror Thing Single Action (arcane, concentrate, polymorph, transmutation) The mutant takes on the specific appearance of any Small or Medium humanoid they can currently see. This doesn't alter their statistics, but it might change the damage type of their Strikes. Revolting Appearance (arcane, aura, visual) Details of the mutant's appearance are disturbing and unnatural in the extreme. A non-mutant living creature who begins their turn within 60 feet of the mutant must succeed at a Fortitude save or become sickened 2. A creature who succeeds at its save is then temporarily immune to the aura for 24 hours. Sprouted Limb The mutant grows an extra leg, increasing their Speed by 10 feet. Too Many Eyes Countless eyes sprout on the mutant's skin. They gain all-around vision.

Creatures who succumb to the frigid elements while cursed by blackfrost don't become mere corpses entombed in ice but rather vicious undead capable of spreading the curse of blackfrost even further. Cracked, frostbitten flesh that emits a freezing vapor like steam; inexorable, unhindered strides through feet of ash-blackened snow; a vacant, icy-blue gaze devoid of humanity—the descriptions of blackfrost dead vary by the teller, but none can deny the supernatural dread these monsters evoke.\n\n Blackfrost dead take a variety of forms. Most are mindless, lumbering brutes, largely indiscernible from mundane zombies except for the curse they can inflict. Others not only maintain their presence of mind but wield powers of psychic corruption not unlike those of blackfrost's originator, Osoyo, the Blackfrost Whale. What form a blackfrost dead takes depends primarily on the victim's psychic fortitude and its aptitude for occult magic.\n\n See the [curse](/Curses.aspx?ID=51) for further details on blackfrost. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Blackfrost Dead Abilities</title> You can modify an existing undead creature to become blackfrost dead using the following abilities. All blackfrost dead bear the [curse of blackfrost](/Curses.aspx?ID=51) and have some way to inflict it, usually using one of their existing Strikes. Most blackfrost dead have one other ability from this list as well. As blackfrost dead stem from blackfrost itself, all blackfrost dead have the [rare](/Traits.aspx?ID=137) trait.\n\n **Blackfrost Breath** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([conjuration](/Traits.aspx?ID=33), [occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120)) The blackfrost dead gasps sharply, then exhales a mist of dark-blue blackfrost particles in a 5-foot emanation. All creatures within the mist become [concealed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=4), and all creatures outside the mist become concealed to creatures within it. The mist persists for 1 minute. A creature that ends its turn in the mist is exposed to blackfrost. The blackfrost dead can't use Blackfrost Breath again for 1d4 rounds.\n\n **Ice Climb** The blackfrost dead can climb on ice as though it had the listed climb Speed. It ignores difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain from ice and snow and doesn't risk falling when crossing ice.\n\n **Mindburning Gaze** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=68), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117), [occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120), [visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=163)) The blackfrost dead fixes its terrifying gaze on a creature within 60 feet. The creature takes 1d4 mental damage per level of the blackfrost dead (minimum 2d4), with a [basic](/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Will save. On a critical failure, the creature is [frightened 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=19).\n\n **Shattering Death** ([cold](/Traits.aspx?ID=27)) When the blackfrost dead is destroyed, its body shatters like brittle ice, filling the air around it with a cloud of frigid, razor-sharp ice shards. Creatures in a 10-foot emanation take 1d8 cold damage per level of the blackfrost dead (minimum 3d8), with a [basic](/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Reflex save. Creatures that critically fail this save also take 1d6 [persistent bleed damage](/Conditions.aspx?ID=29).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Blackfrost Guecubu](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2509) (Creature 8), [Blackfrost Prophet](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2498) (Creature 9), [Blackfrost Zombie](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2497) (Creature 6)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Creating Blackfrost Dead</title>\r\n\r\nThe simplest way to create a blackfrost dead is to use an existing undead, such as a [zombie](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=103) or a [mummy](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=74), as your base creature. Replace the creature's abilities with abilities from the list on this page.

Creatures who succumb to the frigid elements while cursed by blackfrost don't become mere corpses entombed in ice but rather vicious undead capable of spreading the curse of blackfrost even further. Cracked, frostbitten flesh that emits a freezing vapor like steam; inexorable, unhindered strides through feet of ash-blackened snow; a vacant, icy-blue gaze devoid of humanity—the descriptions of blackfrost dead vary by the teller, but none can deny the supernatural dread these monsters evoke. Blackfrost dead take a variety of forms. Most are mindless, lumbering brutes, largely indiscernible from mundane zombies except for the curse they can inflict. Others not only maintain their presence of mind but wield powers of psychic corruption not unlike those of blackfrost's originator, Osoyo, the Blackfrost Whale. What form a blackfrost dead takes depends primarily on the victim's psychic fortitude and its aptitude for occult magic. See the curse for further details on blackfrost. Blackfrost Dead Abilities You can modify an existing undead creature to become blackfrost dead using the following abilities. All blackfrost dead bear the curse of blackfrost and have some way to inflict it, usually using one of their existing Strikes. Most blackfrost dead have one other ability from this list as well. As blackfrost dead stem from blackfrost itself, all blackfrost dead have the rare trait. Blackfrost Breath Two Actions (conjuration, occult) The blackfrost dead gasps sharply, then exhales a mist of dark-blue blackfrost particles in a 5-foot emanation. All creatures within the mist become concealed, and all creatures outside the mist become concealed to creatures within it. The mist persists for 1 minute. A creature that ends its turn in the mist is exposed to blackfrost. The blackfrost dead can't use Blackfrost Breath again for 1d4 rounds. Ice Climb The blackfrost dead can climb on ice as though it had the listed climb Speed. It ignores difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain from ice and snow and doesn't risk falling when crossing ice. Mindburning Gaze Two Actions (emotion, fear, necromancy, occult, visual) The blackfrost dead fixes its terrifying gaze on a creature within 60 feet. The creature takes 1d4 mental damage per level of the blackfrost dead (minimum 2d4), with a basic Will save. On a critical failure, the creature is frightened 1. Shattering Death (cold) When the blackfrost dead is destroyed, its body shatters like brittle ice, filling the air around it with a cloud of frigid, razor-sharp ice shards. Creatures in a 10-foot emanation take 1d8 cold damage per level of the blackfrost dead (minimum 3d8), with a basic Reflex save. Creatures that critically fail this save also take 1d6 persistent bleed damage. Members Blackfrost Guecubu (Creature 8), Blackfrost Prophet (Creature 9), Blackfrost Zombie (Creature 6) Creating Blackfrost Dead The simplest way to create a blackfrost dead is to use an existing undead, such as a zombie or a mummy, as your base creature. Replace the creature's abilities with abilities from the list on this page. All blackfrost dead gain the cold trait and have at least one way to inflict blackfrost, often using one of their Strikes. Curse of the Crown Blackfrost dead are found only around the Nameless Spires, under which a massive alien being named Osoyo remains imprisoned. Only recently has this ancient being stirred from its slumber, causing blackfrost to foam out of fissures in the ice and afflict unfortunate explorers. The spread of the blackfrost curse has been mercifully slow thus far, but with each creature afflicted, Osoyo's reach expands ever outward.
