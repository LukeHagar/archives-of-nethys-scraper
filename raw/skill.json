When you use the [Escape](/Actions.aspx?ID=79) basic action, you can use your Athletics modifier instead of your unarmed attack modifier.\n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Table 4–4: Climb And Swim Distance</title>This table provides a quick reference for how far you can move with a Climb or Swim action.\n\n## Table 4-4: Climb and Swim Distance\n<row gap=\"tiny\">\n<table> <tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\">**Climb Distance**</td><td colspan=\"2\">**Swim Distance**</td></tr> <tr><td>**Speed**</td><td>**Success**</td><td>**Critical Success**</td><td>**Success**</td><td>**Critical Success**</td></tr> <tr><td>5-15 feet</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>10</td></tr> <tr><td>20-35 feet</td><td>5</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>15</td></tr> <tr><td>40-55 feet</td><td>10</td><td>15</td><td>15</td><td>20</td></tr> <tr><td>60-65 feet</td><td>15</td><td>20</td><td>20</td><td>25</td></tr> </table>\r\n</row>\n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Leap</title> The [Leap](/Actions.aspx?ID=81) basic action is used for [High Jump](/Actions.aspx?ID=36) and [Long Jump](/Actions.aspx?ID=37). Leap lets you take a careful, short jump. You can Leap up to 10 feet horizontally if your Speed is at least 15 feet, or up to 15 feet horizontally if your Speed is at least 30 feet. You land in the space where your Leap ends (meaning you can typically clear a 5-foot gap if your Speed is between 15 feet and 30 feet, or a 10-foot gap if your Speed is 30 feet or more). If you make a vertical Leap, you can move up to 3 feet vertically and 5 feet horizontally onto an elevated surface.\n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Forced Movement</title> The Shove action can force a creature to move. When an effect forces you to move, or if you start falling, the distance you move is defined by the effect that moved you, not by your Speed. Because you're not acting to move, this doesn't trigger reactions triggered by movement.\n\n<title level=\"3\">Falling</title> When you fall more than 5 feet, you take falling damage when you land, which is bludgeoning damage equal to half the distance you fell. If you take any damage from a fall, you’re knocked prone when you land.\n\n If you fall into water, snow, or another soft substance, calculate the damage from the fall as though your fall were 20 feet shorter. The reduction can’t be greater than the depth of the water (so when falling into water that is only 10 feet deep, you treat the fall as 10 feet shorter). You can Grab an Edge as a reaction (page 472) to reduce or eliminate the damage from some falls. More detailed rules for falling damage appear on page 463.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Item Bonuses for

Table 4–4: Climb And Swim Distance This table provides a quick reference for how far you can move with a Climb or Swim action. ## Table 4-4: Climb and Swim Distance Climb Distance Swim Distance Speed Success Critical Success Success Critical Success 5-15 feet 5 5 5 10 20-35 feet 5 10 10 15 40-55 feet 10 15 15 20 60-65 feet 15 20 20 25 Leap The Leap basic action is used for High Jump and Long Jump. Leap lets you take a careful, short jump. You can Leap up to 10 feet horizontally if your Speed is at least 15 feet, or up to 15 feet horizontally if your Speed is at least 30 feet. You land in the space where your Leap ends (meaning you can typically clear a 5-foot gap if your Speed is between 15 feet and 30 feet, or a 10-foot gap if your Speed is 30 feet or more). If you make a vertical Leap, you can move up to 3 feet vertically and 5 feet horizontally onto an elevated surface. Forced Movement The Shove action can force a creature to move. When an effect forces you to move, or if you start falling, the distance you move is defined by the effect that moved you, not by your Speed. Because you're not acting to move, this doesn't trigger reactions triggered by movement. Falling When you fall more than 5 feet, you take falling damage when you land, which is bludgeoning damage equal to half the distance you fell. If you take any damage from a fall, you’re knocked prone when you land. If you fall into water, snow, or another soft substance, calculate the damage from the fall as though your fall were 20 feet shorter. The reduction can’t be greater than the depth of the water (so when falling into water that is only 10 feet deep, you treat the fall as 10 feet shorter). You can Grab an Edge as a reaction (page 472) to reduce or eliminate the damage from some falls. More detailed rules for falling damage appear on page 463.

He has a Crafting modifier of +13 and the [Magical Crafting](/Feats.aspx?ID=812) feat. With 2 weeks of downtime ahead of him, he decides to craft a [_striking rune_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=280), a 4th-level item. The GM secretly chooses a DC of 19.\n\n The item has a Price of 65 gp, so Ezren prepares 32 gp, 5 sp worth of raw materials. He has another 32 gp, 5 sp worth of raw materials on hand. After spending 4 days building and incanting spells, he rolls a 12 on his Crafting check, for a result of 25. That’s a success! At this point, Ezren can spend the additional 32 gp, 5 sp worth of materials to complete the item immediately for 65 gp. However, Ezren has 10 more days on his hands, so he decides to spend additional time to complete the item. Because he’s a 5th-level character and an expert at Crafting, he reduces the amount he has to pay by 1 gp for each day spent. After spending 10 days working, he reduces the cost to complete the item from 65 gp to 55 gp. He spends the remaining portion of its Price in materials, completes the _striking rune_, and goes out on his next adventure. (He could have stayed home to keep working on the _striking rune_, eventually reducing the item’s total Price to just the half he paid up front, but adventuring is far more lucrative!)\n\n If Ezren’s Crafting check result were a 29 or higher, he’d have gotten a critical success. In that case, he’d reduce the remaining amount by 2 gp per day, lowering the amount needed to complete the item after 10 additional days of work to 45 gp.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Item Bonuses for

The GM will supply additional nuance based on the history and beliefs of the characters you're interacting with, and their attitudes can change in accordance with the story. The attitudes are detailed on the [Conditions](/conditions) page and are summarized here. \n<ul><li>[Helpful](/Conditions.aspx?ID=21): Willing to help you and responds favorably to your requests. </li><li>[Friendly](/Conditions.aspx?ID=18): Has a good attitude toward you, but won't necessarily stick their neck out to help you. </li><li>[Indifferent](/Conditions.aspx?ID=25): Doesn't care about you either way.

You can roleplay interactions with player characters, and even use Diplomacy results if the player wants a mechanical sense of how convincing or charming a character is, but players make the ultimate

Changing Attitudes Your influence on NPCs is measured with a set of attitudes that reflect how they view your character. These are only a brief summary of a creature's disposition. The GM will supply additional nuance based on the history and beliefs of the characters you're interacting with, and their attitudes can change in accordance with the story. The attitudes are detailed on the Conditions page and are summarized here. Helpful: Willing to help you and responds favorably to your requests. Friendly: Has a good attitude toward you, but won't necessarily stick their neck out to help you. Indifferent: Doesn't care about you either way. (Most NPCs start out indifferent.) Unfriendly: Dislikes you and doesn't want to help you. Hostile: Actively works against you—and might attack you just because of their dislike. No one can ever change the attitude of a player character with these skills. You can roleplay interactions with player characters, and even use Diplomacy results if the player wants a mechanical sense of how convincing or charming a character is, but players make the ultimate decisions about how their characters respond.

Changing Attitudes Your influence on NPCs is measured with a set of attitudes that reflect how they view your character. These are only a brief summary of a creature's disposition. The GM will supply additional nuance based on the history and beliefs of the characters you're interacting with, and their attitudes can change in accordance with the story. The attitudes are detailed on the Conditions page and are summarized here. Helpful: Willing to help you and responds favorably to your requests. Friendly: Has a good attitude toward you, but won't necessarily stick their neck out to help you. Indifferent: Doesn't care about you either way. (Most NPCs start out indifferent.) Unfriendly: Dislikes you and doesn't want to help you. Hostile: Actively works against you—and might attack you just because of their dislike. No one can ever change the attitude of a player character with these skills. You can roleplay interactions with player characters, and even use Diplomacy results if the player wants a mechanical sense of how convincing or charming a character is, but players make the ultimate decisions about how their characters respond.

Performance Trained General Actions - Earn Income by staging a performance. Basic Competence Some performances require you to be more than just charismatic, and if you don't meet the demands of the art form or the audience, the GM might apply a penalty based on the relevant ability score. For example, if you're dancing and have a negative Dexterity modifier, you might take a penalty to your attempt at dancing. Likewise, if you are orating and have a negative Intelligence modifier, you might have to hope your raw Charisma can overcome the penalties from your intellectual shortcomings—or ask someone to help write your speeches! Performance Traits When you use an action that utilizes the Performance skill, it gains one or more traits relevant to the type of performance. The GM might change these depending on the circumstances, but the most common performance-based traits are listed below. ## Performance Traits Performance Additional Traits Act or perform comedy
