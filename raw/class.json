These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Alchemy</title>\r\nYou understand the complex interactions of natural and unnatural substances and can concoct alchemical items to meet your needs. You can do this using normal reagents and the Craft activity, or you can use special infused reagents that allow you to craft temporary items quickly and at no cost. Over time, you can create more and more alchemical items for free, and since each of them becomes more and more powerful, you advance in power dramatically, leaving behind those who don't understand your strange science.\n\n You gain the [Alchemical Crafting](/Feats.aspx?ID=752) feat, even if you don't meet that feat's prerequisites, and you gain the four common 1st-level alchemical formulas granted by that feat. Alchemical Items can be found [here](/equipment/alchemical-items). You can use this feat to create alchemical items as long as you have the items' formulas in your formula book.\n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Infused Reagents</title>You infuse reagents with your own alchemical essence, allowing you to create alchemical items at no cost. Each day during your daily preparations, you gain a number of batches of infused reagents equal to your level + your Intelligence modifier. You can use these reagents for either advanced alchemy or Quick Alchemy, described below. Together, these infused reagents have light Bulk.\n\n As soon as you make your next daily preparations, your infused reagents from the previous day's preparations are instantly destroyed, and nonpermanent effects of your previous day's infused items immediately end. While infused reagents are physical objects, they can't be duplicated, preserved, or created in any way other than your daily preparations. Any such artificial reagents lack the infusion and are useless for advanced alchemy or Quick Alchemy.\n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Advanced Alchemy</title>During your daily preparations, after producing new infused reagents, you can spend batches of those infused reagents to create infused alchemical items. You don't need to attempt a Crafting check to do this, and you ignore both the number of days typically required to create the items and any alchemical reagent requirements. Your advanced alchemy level is equal to your level. For each batch of infused reagents you spend, choose an alchemical item of your advanced alchemy level or lower that's in your formula book, and make a batch of two of that item. These items have the [infused](/Traits.aspx?ID=94) trait and remain potent for 24 hours or until your next daily preparations, whichever comes first.\n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Quick Alchemy</title>If you need a specific alchemical item on the fly, you can use your infused reagents to quickly create it with the Quick Alchemy action.\r\n\r\n<document level=\"4\" id=\"action-2\" />\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Formula Book</title>\r\nAn alchemist keeps meticulous records of the formulas for every item they can create. You start with a standard [formula book](/Equipment.aspx?ID=22) worth 10 sp or less for free. The formula book contains the formulas for two common 1st-level alchemical items of your choice, in addition to those you gained from Alchemical Crafting and your research field. Alchemical Items can be found [here](/equipment/alchemical-items).\n\n Each time you gain a level, you can add the formulas for two common alchemical items to your formula book. These new formulas can be for any level of item you can create. You learn these formulas automatically, but it's also possible to find or buy additional formulas in settlements or from other alchemists, or to invent them with the [Inventor](/Feats.aspx?ID=798) feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Research Field</title>\r\nYour inquiries into the alchemical nature of the universe have led you to focus on a particular field of research. You might have a degree from a scientific institute, correspond with other researchers in your field, or work as a genius loner. Choose a field of research.\n\n Your research field adds a number of formulas to your formula book; these are your signature items. When using a batch of infused reagents to create your signature items using advanced alchemy, you create three items instead of two. Each time you gain a level, you can swap one of your signature items with another formula in your formula book. This new signature item must be on your research field's list of possible signature items.\n\nResearch fields can be found [here](/classes/alchemist/research-fields).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Alchemist Feats</title>\r\nAt 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain an [alchemist class feat](/Classes.aspx?ID=1/feats).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Skill Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat.

You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">General Feats</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter 5.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Skill Increases</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you’re untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you’re already trained to expert.\n\n At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you’re already a master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Ability Boosts</title>\r\nAt 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Ancestry Feats</title>\r\nIn addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.

When you use Quick Alchemy to create an infused alchemical item that allows a saving throw, you can change its DC to your class DC.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 7\">Alchemical Weapon Expertise</title>\r\nYou’ve trained to more effectively wield the weapons you find in your lab. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, unarmed attacks, and alchemical bombs increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 7\">Iron Will</title>\r\nYour mental defenses are an iron fortress. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 7\">Perpetual Infusions</title>\r\nYou have learned how to create perpetual alchemical infusions that can provide a near-infinite supply of certain simple items. You gain the ability to create two 1st-level alchemical items using Quick Alchemy without spending a batch of infused reagents. The items you can select depend on your research field and must be in your formula book.\n\nSee specific [research fields](/classes/alchemist/research-fields) for more information.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 9\">Alchemical Expertise</title>\r\nConstant practice has increased the effectiveness of your concoctions.

Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 9\">Double Brew</title>\r\nYou know your formulas so well that you can concoct two items at once. When using the Quick Alchemy action, instead of spending one batch of infused reagents to create a single item, you can spend up to two batches of infused reagents to make up to two alchemical items as described in that action. These items do not have to be the same.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Juggernaut</title>\r\nYour body has become accustomed to physical hazards and resistant to pathogens and ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Perpetual Potency</title>\r\nYour perpetual infusions improve, allowing you to use Quick Alchemy to create more powerful items with no cost. The items you can select depend on your research field and must be in your formula book.\n\nSee specific [research fields](/classes/alchemist/research-fields) for more information.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Greater Field Discovery</title>\r\nYou learn an incredible discovery that advances your understanding of your field.\n\nSee specific [research fields](/classes/alchemist/research-fields) for more information.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Medium Armor Expertise</title>\r\nYou’ve learned how to dodge while wearing medium, light or no armor. Your proficiency ranks for medium armor, light armor, and unarmored defense increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Weapon Specialization</title>\r\nYou’ve learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master, and to 4 if you’re legendary.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 15\">Alchemical Alacrity</title>\r\nYour comfort in concocting items is such that you can create three at a time. When using the Quick Alchemy action, you can spend up to three batches of infused reagents to make up to three alchemical items as described in that action. These items do not have to be the same, and you automatically stow one of these new items as you create them.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 15\">Evasion</title>\r\nYou’ve learned to move quickly to avoid explosions, dragon’s breath, and worse. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master.

Key Ability: Intelligence At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Intelligence Hit Points: 8 plus your Constitution modifier You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. Key Terms You'll see the following key terms in many alchemist abilities. Additive : Feats with the additive trait allow you to spend actions to add special substances to bombs or elixirs. You can add only one additive to a single alchemical item, and attempting to add another spoils the item. You can typically use actions with the additive trait only when you're creating an infused alchemical item, and some can be used only with the Quick Alchemy action.

Roleplaying the Alchemist During Combat Encounters... You lob bombs at your foes, harry your enemies, and support the rest of your party with potent elixirs. At higher levels, your mutagens warp your body into a resilient and powerful weapon. During Social Encounters... You provide knowledge and experience about alchemical items and related secrets, such as poisons and diseases. While Exploring... You keep an eye out for trouble with your bombs at the ready, while giving advice on all things alchemical and mysterious. In Downtime... You experiment in an alchemical lab, brewing elixirs, making bombs, and furthering your alchemical knowledge. You Might... Enjoy tinkering with strange formulas and alchemical reagents, often with a single-minded dedication and recklessness that gives others pause. Get a kick out of wreaking havoc with the alchemical concoctions you’ve made, and enjoy watching things burn, dissolve, freeze, and jolt. Endlessly experiment to discover new, more potent alchemical tools. Others Probably...

Alchemy You understand the complex interactions of natural and unnatural substances and can concoct alchemical items to meet your needs. You can do this using normal reagents and the Craft activity, or you can use special infused reagents that allow you to craft temporary items quickly and at no cost. Over time, you can create more and more alchemical items for free, and since each of them becomes more and more powerful, you advance in power dramatically, leaving behind those who don't understand your strange science.

Alchemical Items can be found here. You can use this feat to create alchemical items as long as you have the items' formulas in your formula book. Infused Reagents You infuse reagents with your own alchemical essence, allowing you to create alchemical items at no cost. Each day during your daily preparations, you gain a number of batches of infused reagents equal to your level + your Intelligence modifier. You can use these reagents for either advanced alchemy or Quick Alchemy, described below. Together, these infused reagents have light Bulk. As soon as you make your next daily preparations, your infused reagents from the previous day's preparations are instantly destroyed, and nonpermanent effects of your previous day's infused items immediately end. While infused reagents are physical objects, they can't be duplicated, preserved, or created in any way other than your daily preparations.

Advanced Alchemy During your daily preparations, after producing new infused reagents, you can spend batches of those infused reagents to create infused alchemical items. You don't need to attempt a Crafting check to do this, and you ignore both the number of days typically required to create the items and any alchemical reagent requirements. Your advanced alchemy level is equal to your level.

These items have the infused trait and remain potent for 24 hours or until your next daily preparations, whichever comes first. Quick Alchemy If you need a specific alchemical item on the fly, you can use your infused reagents to quickly create it with the Quick Alchemy action. Formula Book An alchemist keeps meticulous records of the formulas for every item they can create. You start with a standard formula book worth 10 sp or less for free. The formula book contains the formulas for two common 1st-level alchemical items of your choice, in addition to those you gained from Alchemical Crafting and your research field. Alchemical Items can be found here. Each time you gain a level, you can add the formulas for two common alchemical items to your formula book. These new formulas can be for any level of item you can create. You learn these formulas automatically, but it's also possible to find or buy additional formulas in settlements or from other alchemists, or to invent them with the Inventor feat. Research Field Your inquiries into the alchemical nature of the universe have led you to focus on a particular field of research. You might have a degree from a scientific institute, correspond with other researchers in your field, or work as a genius loner. Choose a field of research. Your research field adds a number of formulas to your formula book; these are your signature items.

If the spell includes a verbal component, you must use an [auditory](/Traits.aspx?ID=16) performance, and if it includes a somatic component, you must use a [visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=163) one. The spell gains all the traits of the performance you used. You can cast only one composition spell each turn, and you can have only one active at a time. If you cast a new composition spell, any ongoing effects from your previous composition spell end immediately.\n\n **[Metamagic](/Traits.aspx?ID=107)**: Actions with the metamagic trait tweak the properties of your spells. These actions usually come from metamagic feats. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell's effect, not of the metamagic action itself.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Roleplaying the Bard</title>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">During Combat Encounters...</title>\r\nYou use magical performances to alter the odds in favor of your allies.

Background</title>\r\nIn addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background, as described in Chapter 2.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Initial Proficiencies</title>\r\nAt 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Occult Spellcasting</title>\r\nYou draw upon magic from esoteric knowledge. You can cast occult spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells (see [Casting Spells](/Rules.aspx?ID=280)). Because you're a bard, you can usually play an instrument for spells requiring somatic or material components, as long as it takes at least one of your hands to do so. If you use an instrument, you don't need a [material component pouch](/Equipment.aspx?ID=33) or another hand free. You can usually also play an instrument for spells requiring verbal components, instead of speaking.\n\nEach day, you can cast up to two 1st-level spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.\n\n As you increase in level as a bard, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 3–6: Bard Spells per Day\n\n Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier. Details on calculating these statistics are found under [Spell Attack Rolls](/Rules.aspx?ID=325). \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Heightening Spells</title> When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast in order to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are [heightened](/Rules.aspx?ID=273) to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Cantrips</title> Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest level of bard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level bard, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level bard, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Spell Repertoire</title>\r\nThe collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-level occult spells of your choice and five occult cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the [occult](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=3) list or from other occult spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level.\n\n You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 3–6), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same level. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select two 2nd-level spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-level version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.\n\n Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</title> As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during [downtime](/Rules.aspx?ID=473).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Composition Spells</title>\r\nYou can infuse your performances with magic to create unique effects called compositions. Compositions are a special type of spell that often require you to use the Performance skill when casting them. Composition spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to perform, write a new composition, or otherwise engage your muse.\n\n Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points. The full rules for focus spells are found [here](/Rules.aspx?ID=276).\n\n You learn the [_counter performance_](/Spells.aspx?ID=381) composition spell, protecting against auditory and visual effects.\n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Composition Cantrips</title> Composition cantrips are special composition spells that don't cost Focus Points, so you can use them as often as you like. Composition cantrips are in addition to the cantrips you choose from the occult list. Generally, only feats can give you more composition cantrips. Unlike other cantrips, you can't swap out composition cantrips gained from bard feats at a later level, unless you swap out the specific feat via [retraining](/Rules.aspx?ID=475). You learn the [_inspire courage_](/Spells.aspx?ID=386) composition cantrip, which boosts your allies' attacks, damage, and defense against fear.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Muses</title>\r\nAs a bard, you select one muse at 1st level. This muse leads you to great things, and might be a physical creature, a deity, a philosophy, or a captivating mystery.\n\nMuses can be found [here](/classes/bard/muses).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Bard Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a [bard class feat](/Classes.aspx?ID=3/feats).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Skill Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. Skill feats can be found in Chapter 5 and have the skill trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">General Feats</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter 5.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Lightning Reflexes</title>\r\nYour reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank in Reflex saves increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Signature Spells</title>\r\nExperience allows you to cast some spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don’t need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you’ve learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell level at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Skill Increases</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you’re untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you’re already trained to expert.\n\n At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you’re already a master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Ability Boosts</title>\r\nAt 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Ancestry Feats</title>\r\nIn addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. The list of feats is in your ancestry’s entry in Chapter 2.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 7\">Expert Spellcaster</title>\r\nYour proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 9\">Great Fortitude</title>\r\nYour physique is incredibly hardy. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 9\">Resolve</title>\r\nYou’ve steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Bard Weapon Expertise</title>\r\nYou have become thoroughly adept with bardic weapons. You gain expert proficiency in simple weapons and unarmed attacks, plus the [longsword](/Weapons.aspx?ID=31), [rapier](/Weapons.aspx?ID=36), [sap](/Weapons.aspx?ID=37), [shortbow](/Weapons.aspx?ID=77), [shortsword](/Weapons.aspx?ID=43), and [whip](/Weapons.aspx?ID=48). When you critically succeed at an attack roll using one of these weapons or an unarmed attack while one of your compositions is active, you apply the critical specialization effect for that weapon or unarmed attack.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Vigilant Senses</title>\r\nThrough your adventures, you’ve developed keen awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Light Armor Expertise</title>\r\nYou’ve learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Weapon Specialization</title>\r\nYou’ve learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 damage if you’re a master, and 4 damage if you’re legendary.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 15\">Master Spellcaster</title>\r\nYou’ve mastered the occult. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 17\">Greater Resolve</title>\r\nYour unbelievable training grants you mental resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to legendary. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success. When you roll a critical failure on a Will save, you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure on a Will save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 19\">Legendary Spellcaster</title>\r\nYour command of occult magic is the stuff of legends. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to legendary.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 19\">Magnum Opus</title>\r\nYou have tuned your spellcasting to the highest caliber. Add two common 10th-level occult spells to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast one of those two spells using bard spellcasting. You don’t gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, unlike other spell slots, and you can’t use 10th-level slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots.","name":"Bard","navigation":[{"label":"Details","url":"/classes/bard"},{"label":"Feats","url":"/classes/bard/feats"},{"label":"Sample Builds","url":"/classes/bard/sample-builds"},{"label":"Class Kit","url":"/classes/bard/class-kit"},{"label":"Focus Spells","url":"/classes/bard/focus-spells"},{"label":"Muses","url":"/classes/bard/muses"}],"perception_proficiency":"Expert","pfs":"Standard","rarity":"common","reflex_proficiency":"Trained","release_date":"2019-08-01","resistance":{},"search_markdown":"<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<additional-info>\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Core Rulebook](/Sources.aspx?ID=1) pg. 94 <sup>4.0</sup></row>\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nAn artist and a scholar, the bard uses performance and esoteric learning to bolster their companions and foil their enemies.

Using powerful performances, you influence minds and elevate souls to new levels of heroics. You might use your powers to become a charismatic leader, or perhaps you might instead be a counselor, manipulator, scholar, scoundrel, or virtuoso. While your versatility leads some to consider you a beguiling ne’erdo- well and a jack-of-all-trades, it’s dangerous to dismiss you as a master of none. Key Ability: Charisma At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Charisma. Hit Points: 8 plus your Constitution modifier You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. Key Terms You'll see the following key terms in many bard class features. Composition : To cast a composition cantrip or focus spell, you use a type of Performance. If the spell includes a verbal component, you must use an auditory performance, and if it includes a somatic component, you must use a visual one. The spell gains all the traits of the performance you used. You can cast only one composition spell each turn, and you can have only one active at a time. If you cast a new composition spell, any ongoing effects from your previous composition spell end immediately. Metamagic : Actions with the metamagic trait tweak the properties of your spells. These actions usually come from metamagic feats. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell's effect, not of the metamagic action itself. Roleplaying the Bard During Combat Encounters... You use magical performances to alter the odds in favor of your allies. You confidently alternate between attacks, healing, and helpful spells as needed. During Social Encounters... You persuade, prevaricate, and threaten with ease. While Exploring... You’re a font of knowledge, folktales, legends, and lore that provide a deeper context and helpful reconnaissance for the group’s adventure. Your spells and performances inspire your allies to greater discovery and success. In Downtime... You can earn money and prestige with your performances, gaining a name for yourself and acquiring patrons. Eventually, tales of your talents and triumphs might attract other bards to study your techniques in a bardic college. You Might... Have a passion for your art so strong that you forge a spiritual connection with it. Take point when tact and nonviolent solutions are required. Follow your muse, whether it’s a mysterious fey creature, a philosophical concept, a psychic force, or a deity of art or music, and with its aid learn secret lore that few others have. Others Probably... Relish the opportunity to invite you to social events, either as a performer or a guest, but consider you to be something of a curiosity in their social circles. Underestimate you compared to other spellcasters, believing you are little more than a foppish minstrel and overlooking the subtle power of your magic. Respond favorably to your social charm and abilities, but remain suspicious of your beguiling magic.

Ancestry and Background In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background, as described in Chapter 2. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class. Occult Spellcasting You draw upon magic from esoteric knowledge. You can cast occult spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells (see Casting Spells). Because you're a bard, you can usually play an instrument for spells requiring somatic or material components, as long as it takes at least one of your hands to do so. If you use an instrument, you don't need a material component pouch or another hand free. You can usually also play an instrument for spells requiring verbal components, instead of speaking. Each day, you can cast up to two 1st-level spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots. As you increase in level as a bard, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 3–6: Bard Spells per Day Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier. Details on calculating these statistics are found under Spell Attack Rolls. Heightening Spells When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast in order to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely. Cantrips Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest level of bard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level bard, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level bard, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells. Spell Repertoire The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-level occult spells of your choice and five occult cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the occult list or from other occult spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level. You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 3–6), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same level. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select two 2nd-level spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-level version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell. Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa. Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime. Composition Spells You can infuse your performances with magic to create unique effects called compositions. Compositions are a special type of spell that often require you to use the Performance skill when casting them. Composition spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to perform, write a new composition, or otherwise engage your muse. Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points. The full rules for focus spells are found here. You learn the counter performance composition spell, protecting against auditory and visual effects. Composition Cantrips Composition cantrips are special composition spells that don't cost Focus Points, so you can use them as often as you like. Composition cantrips are in addition to the cantrips you choose from the occult list. Generally, only feats can give you more composition cantrips. Unlike other cantrips, you can't swap out composition cantrips gained from bard feats at a later level, unless you swap out the specific feat via retraining. You learn the inspire courage composition cantrip, which boosts your allies' attacks, damage, and defense against fear. Muses As a bard, you select one muse at 1st level. This muse leads you to great things, and might be a physical creature, a deity, a philosophy, or a captivating mystery. Muses can be found here. Bard Feats At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a bard class feat. Skill Feats At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. Skill feats can be found in Chapter 5 and have the skill trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat. General Feats At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter 5. Lightning Reflexes Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank in Reflex saves increases to expert. Signature Spells Experience allows you to cast some spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don’t need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you’ve learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell level at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does. Skill Increases At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you’re untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you’re already trained to expert. At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you’re already a master. Ability Boosts At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18. Ancestry Feats In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. The list of feats is in your ancestry’s entry in Chapter 2. Expert Spellcaster Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert. Great Fortitude Your physique is incredibly hardy. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert. Resolve You’ve steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead. Bard Weapon Expertise You have become thoroughly adept with bardic weapons. You gain expert proficiency in simple weapons and unarmed attacks, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, shortbow, shortsword, and whip. When you critically succeed at an attack roll using one of these weapons or an unarmed attack while one of your compositions is active, you apply the critical specialization effect for that weapon or unarmed attack. Vigilant Senses Through your adventures, you’ve developed keen awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master. Light Armor Expertise You’ve learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to expert. Weapon Specialization You’ve learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 damage if you’re a master, and 4 damage if you’re legendary. Master Spellcaster You’ve mastered the occult. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master. Greater Resolve Your unbelievable training grants you mental resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to legendary. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success. When you roll a critical failure on a Will save, you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure on a Will save against a damaging effect, you take half damage. Legendary Spellcaster Your command of occult magic is the stuff of legends. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to legendary. Magnum Opus You have tuned your spellcasting to the highest caliber. Add two common 10th-level occult spells to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast one of those two spells using bard spellcasting. You don’t gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, unlike other spell slots, and you can’t use 10th-level slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots.","trait_markdown":"","type":"Class","url":"/Classes.aspx?ID=3","weakness":{},"will_proficiency":"Expert"}},{"_index":"aon18","_id":"class-4","_score":6.847722,"_source":{"ability":["Strength","Dexterity"],"attack_proficiency":["Trained in simple weapons","Trained in martial weapons","Trained in unarmed attacks"],"breadcrumbs_spa":[],"category":"class","defense_proficiency":["Trained in all armor","Trained in unarmored defense"],"exclude_from_search":false,"fortitude_proficiency":"Expert","hp":10,"hp_raw":"10","icon_image":"/Images/Class/Champion_Icon.png","id":"class-4","image":["/Images/Classes/Iconic_Seelah.png"],"markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Class\" pfs=\"Standard\">[Champion](/Classes.aspx?ID=4)</title>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n<column gap=\"medium\" flex=\"1 1 400px\">\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Core Rulebook](/Sources.aspx?ID=1) pg. 104 <sup>4.0</sup></row>\n\n_You are an emissary of a deity, a devoted servant who has taken up a weighty mantle, and you adhere to a code that holds you apart from those around you.

Deities often add additional strictures (for instance, [Torag’s](/Deities.aspx?ID=18) champions can’t show mercy to enemies of their people, making it almost impossible for them to follow the [redeemer](/Causes.aspx?ID=2) cause). Tenets are listed in order of importance, starting with the most important. If a situation places two tenets in conflict, you aren’t in a no-win situation; instead, follow the more important tenet. For instance, as a paladin, if an evil king asked you if you’re hiding refugees so he could execute them, you could lie to him, since the tenet against lying is less important than preventing harm to innocents. Trying to subvert your code by creating a situation that forces a higher tenet to override a lower tenet (for example, promising not to respect authorities and then, to keep your word, disrespecting authorities) is a violation of the champion code.\n\n If you stray from your alignment or violate your code of conduct, you lose your focus pool and divine ally until you demonstrate your repentance by conducting an [_atone_](/Rituals.aspx?ID=2) ritual, but you keep any other champion abilities that don’t require those class features. If your alignment shifts but is still one allowed by your deity, your GM might let you retrain your cause while still following the same deity.\n\nTenets can be found [here](/classes/champion/tenets).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Deity and Cause</title>\r\nChampions are divine servants of a deity. Choose a [deity](/deities) to follow; your alignment must be one allowed for followers of your deity. Actions fundamentally opposed to your deity’s ideals or alignment are anathema to your faith. A few examples of acts that would be considered anathema appear in each deity’s entry. You and your GM determine whether other acts are anathema. You have one of the following causes. Your cause must match your alignment exactly. Your cause determines your champion’s reaction, grants you a devotion spell, and defines part of your champion’s code.\n\nCauses can be found [here](/classes/champion/causes).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Deific Weapon</title>\r\nYou zealously bear your deity’s favored weapon. If it’s uncommon, you gain access to it. If it’s an unarmed attack with a d4 damage die or a simple weapon, increase the damage die by one step (d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, d10 to d12).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Champion's Reaction</title>\r\nYour cause gives you a special reaction. See specific [causes](/classes/champion/causes) for more information.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Devotion Spells</title>\r\nYour deity's power grants you special divine spells called devotion spells, which are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to pray to your deity or do service toward their causes.\n\n Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Certain feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points. The full rules are found [here](/Rules.aspx?ID=276). You gain a devotion spell depending on your cause, and you are trained in divine spell attack rolls and spell DCs. Your spellcasting ability is Charisma.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Champion Feats</title>\r\nAt 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a [champion class feat](/Classes.aspx?ID=4/feats).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Shield Block</title>\r\nYou gain the [Shield Block](/Feats.aspx?ID=839) general feat, a reaction that lets you reduce damage with your shield.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Skill Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. Skill feats can be found in Chapter 5 and have the skill trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Divine Ally</title>\r\nYour devotion attracts a spirit of your deity's alignment. Once you choose an ally, your choice can't be changed.\n\n The following are divine allies: \n\n**Blade Ally**: A spirit of battle dwells within your armaments. Select one weapon or [_handwraps of mighty blows_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=441) when you make your daily preparations. In your hands, the item gains the effect of a property rune and you also gain the weapon's critical specialization effect. For a champion following the [tenets of good](/Tenets.aspx?ID=1), choose _[disrupting](/Equipment.aspx?ID=294)_, _[ghost touch](/Equipment.aspx?ID=297)_, _[returning](/Equipment.aspx?ID=301)_, or _[shifting](/Equipment.aspx?ID=302)_. For a champion following the [tenets of evil](/Tenets.aspx?ID=2), choose [_fearsome_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=731), _returning_, or _shifting_.\n\n**Shield Ally**: A spirit of protection dwells within your shield. In your hands, the shield's Hardness increases by 2 and its HP and BT increase by half. \n\n**Steed Ally**: You gain a young [animal companion](/animal-companions) as a mount. Ordinarily, your animal companion is one that has the mount special ability, such as a [horse](/AnimalCompanions.aspx?ID=6). You can select a different animal companion (GM's discretion), but this ability doesn't grant it the mount special ability.\n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">General Feats</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter 5.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Skill Increases</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you’re untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you’re already trained to expert.\n\n At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you’re already a master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Ability Boosts</title>\r\nAt 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, boost four different ability scores. You can use these boosts to increase ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Ancestry Feats</title>\r\nIn addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry’s entry in Chapter 2.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Weapon Expertise</title>\r\nYou’ve dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 7\">Armor Expertise</title>\r\nYou have spent so much time in armor that you know how to make the most of its protection. Your proficiency ranks for light, medium, and heavy armor, as well as for unarmored defense, increase to expert. You gain the armor specialization effects of medium and heavy armor.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 7\">Weapon Specialization</title>\r\nYou’ve learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master, and to 4 if you’re legendary.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 9\">Champion Expertise</title>\r\nPrayers strengthen your divine power. Your proficiency ranks for your champion class DC and divine spell attack rolls and DCs increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 9\">Divine Smite</title>\r\nYour champion’s reaction improves.\n\nSee specific [causes](/classes/champion/causes) for more information.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 9\">Juggernaut</title>\r\nYour body is accustomed to physical hardship and resistant to ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 9\">Lightning Reflexes</title>\r\nYour reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Alertness</title>\r\nYou remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Divine Will</title>\r\nYour faith grants mastery of your will. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master.

Steadfast in their …","text":" Champion Source Core Rulebook pg. 104 4.0 You are an emissary of a deity, a devoted servant who has taken up a weighty mantle, and you adhere to a code that holds you apart from those around you. While champions exist for every alignment, as a champion of good, you provide certainty and hope to the innocent. You have powerful defenses that you share freely with your allies and innocent bystanders, as well as holy power you use to end the threat of evil. Your devotion even attracts the attention of holy spirits who aid you on your journey. Key Ability: Strength or Dexterity At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to your choice of Strength or Dexterity. Hit Points: 10 plus your Constitution modifier You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. Key Terms You'll see these terms in many champion abilities. Flourish : Flourishes are techniques that require too much exertion to perform a large number in a row. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn. Metamagic : These actions tweak your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell's effect, not of the metamagic action. Oath : Oaths add an additional tenet to your code. You can usually have only one feat with this trait. Roleplaying the Champion During Combat Encounters... You confront enemies in hand-to-hand combat while carefully positioning yourself to protect your allies. During Social Encounters... You are a voice of hope, striving to reach a peaceful solution that strengthens bonds and yields good results for all. While Exploring... You overcome barriers both physical and spiritual, providing inspiration to your allies through your actions and—when your fellow adventurers ask for it—providing moral and ethical guidance. In Downtime... You spend much of your time in solemn prayer and contemplation, rigorous training, charity work, and fulfilling the tenets of your code, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t time to take up a craft or hobby. You Might... Believe there is always hope that good will triumph over evil, no matter how grim the odds. Know the ends don’t justify the means, since evil acts increase the power of evil. Have a strong sense of right and wrong, and grow frustrated when greed or shortsightedness breeds evil. Others Probably... See you as a symbol of hope, especially in a time of great need. Worry you secretly despise them for not living up to your impossible standard, or that you are unwilling to compromise when necessary. Know that you’ve sworn divine oaths of service they can trust you to keep. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics. You are untrained in anything not listed unless you gain a better proficiency rank in some other way. Perception Trained in Perception Saving Throws Expert in Fortitude Trained in Reflex Expert in Will Skills Trained in Religion Trained in one skill determined by your choice of deity Trained in a number of additional skills equal to 2 plus your Intelligence modifier Attacks Trained in simple weapons Trained in martial weapons Trained in unarmed attacks Defenses Trained in all armor Trained in unarmored defense Class DC Trained in champion class DC Spells Trained in divine spell attacks Trained in divine spell DCs Class Features You gain these features as Champion.

Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training, noted at the start of this class. Champion's Code You follow a code of conduct, beginning with tenets shared by all champions of an alignment (such as good), and continuing with tenets of your cause. Deities often add additional strictures (for instance, Torag’s champions can’t show mercy to enemies of their people, making it almost impossible for them to follow the redeemer cause). Tenets are listed in order of importance, starting with the most important. If a situation places two tenets in conflict, you aren’t in a no-win situation; instead, follow the more important tenet. For instance, as a paladin, if an evil king asked you if you’re hiding refugees so he could execute them, you could lie to him, since the tenet against lying is less important than preventing harm to innocents. Trying to subvert your code by creating a situation that forces a higher tenet to override a lower tenet (for example, promising not to respect authorities and then, to keep your word, disrespecting authorities) is a violation of the champion code. If you stray from your alignment or violate your code of conduct, you lose your focus pool and divine ally until you demonstrate your repentance by conducting an atone ritual, but you keep any other champion abilities that don’t require those class features. If your alignment shifts but is still one allowed by your deity, your GM might let you retrain your cause while still following the same deity. Tenets can be found here. Deity and Cause Champions are divine servants of a deity. Choose a deity to follow; your alignment must be one allowed for followers of your deity. Actions fundamentally opposed to your deity’s ideals or alignment are anathema to your faith. A few examples of acts that would be considered anathema appear in each deity’s entry. You and your GM determine whether other acts are anathema. You have one of the following causes. Your cause must match your alignment exactly. Your cause determines your champion’s reaction, grants you a devotion spell, and defines part of your champion’s code. Causes can be found here. Deific Weapon You zealously bear your deity’s favored weapon. If it’s uncommon, you gain access to it. If it’s an unarmed attack with a d4 damage die or a simple weapon, increase the damage die by one step (d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, d10 to d12). Champion's Reaction Your cause gives you a special reaction. See specific causes for more information. Devotion Spells Your deity's power grants you special divine spells called devotion spells, which are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to pray to your deity or do service toward their causes. Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Certain feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points. The full rules are found here. You gain a devotion spell depending on your cause, and you are trained in divine spell attack rolls and spell DCs. Your spellcasting ability is Charisma. Champion Feats At 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a champion class feat. Shield Block You gain the Shield Block general feat, a reaction that lets you reduce damage with your shield. Skill Feats At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. Skill feats can be found in Chapter 5 and have the skill trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat. Divine Ally Your devotion attracts a spirit of your deity's alignment. Once you choose an ally, your choice can't be changed. The following are divine allies: Blade Ally : A spirit of battle dwells within your armaments. Select one weapon or handwraps of mighty blows when you make your daily preparations. In your hands, the item gains the effect of a property rune and you also gain the weapon's critical specialization effect. For a champion following the tenets of good, choose disrupting , ghost touch , returning , or shifting . For a champion following the tenets of evil, choose fearsome , returning , or shifting . Shield Ally : A spirit of protection dwells within your shield. In your hands, the shield's Hardness increases by 2 and its HP and BT increase by half. Steed Ally : You gain a young animal companion as a mount. Ordinarily, your animal companion is one that has the mount special ability, such as a horse. You can select a different animal companion (GM's discretion), but this ability doesn't grant it the mount special ability. General Feats At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter 5. Skill Increases At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you’re untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you’re already trained to expert. At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you’re already a master. Ability Boosts At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, boost four different ability scores. You can use these boosts to increase ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18. Ancestry Feats In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry’s entry in Chapter 2. Weapon Expertise You’ve dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to expert. Armor Expertise You have spent so much time in armor that you know how to make the most of its protection. Your proficiency ranks for light, medium, and heavy armor, as well as for unarmored defense, increase to expert. You gain the armor specialization effects of medium and heavy armor. Weapon Specialization You’ve learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master, and to 4 if you’re legendary. Champion Expertise Prayers strengthen your divine power. Your proficiency ranks for your champion class DC and divine spell attack rolls and DCs increase to expert. Divine Smite Your champion’s reaction improves. See specific causes for more information. Juggernaut Your body is accustomed to physical hardship and resistant to ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead. Lightning Reflexes Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert. Alertness You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert. Divine Will Your faith grants mastery of your will. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead. Exalt Your champion’s reaction exalts nearby allies, allowing them to benefit as well. See specific causes for more information. Armor Mastery Your skill with armor improves, helping you avoid more blows. Your proficiency ranks for light, medium, and heavy armor, as well as for unarmored defense, increase to master. Weapon Mastery You fully understand your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple and martial weapons and unarmed attacks increase to master. Greater Weapon Specialization Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you’re an expert, 6 if you’re a master, and 8 if you’re legendary. Champion Mastery You’ve mastered your arsenal of champion techniques and divine spells. Your proficiency ranks for your champion class DC and for divine spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master. Legendary Armor You shield yourself with steel as easily as with faith. Your proficiency ranks for light, medium, and heavy armor, as well as for unarmored defense, increase to legendary. Hero's Defiance You can defy fate and continue fighting as long as you have divine energy. You gain the hero’s defiance devotion spell.","trait_markdown":"","type":"Class","url":"/Classes.aspx?ID=4","weakness":{},"will_proficiency":"Expert"}},{"_index":"aon18","_id":"class-5","_score":6.847722,"_source":{"ability":["Wisdom"],"attack_proficiency":["Trained in simple weapons","Trained in the favored weapon of your deity.

The most common deities in Pathfinder are found [here](/deities), along with their alignments, areas of concern, and the benefits you get for being a cleric of that deity. Your alignment must be one allowed by your deity, as listed in their entry. Your deity grants you the trained proficiency rank in one skill and with the deity's favored weapon. If the favored weapon is uncommon, you also get access to that weapon.\n\n Your deity also adds spells to your spell list. You can prepare these just like you can any spell on the divine spell list, once you can prepare spells of their level as a cleric. Some of these spells aren't normally on the divine list, but they're divine spells if you prepare them this way.\n\nA list of all deities can be found [here.](/deities)\n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Anathema</title>Acts fundamentally opposed to your deity's alignment or ideals are anathema to your faith. Learning or casting spells, committing acts, and using items that are anathema to your deity remove you from your deity's good graces.\n\n Casting spells with the evil trait is almost always anathema to good deities, and casting good spells is likewise anathema to evil deities; similarly, casting chaotic spells is anathema to lawful deities, and casting lawful spells is anathema to chaotic deities. A neutral cleric who worships a neutral deity isn't limited this way, but their alignment might change over time if they frequently cast spells or use abilities with a certain alignment. Similarly, casting spells that are anathema to the tenets or goals of your faith could interfere with your connection to your deity. For example, casting a spell to create undead would be anathema to [Pharasma](/Deities.aspx?ID=14), the goddess of death. For borderline cases, you and your GM determine which acts are anathema.\n\n If you perform enough acts that are anathema to your deity, or if your alignment changes to one not allowed by your deity, you lose the magical abilities that come from your connection to your deity. The class features that you lose are determined by the GM, but they likely include your divine font and all divine spellcasting. These abilities can be regained only if you demonstrate your repentance by conducting an [_atone_](/Rituals.aspx?ID=2) ritual.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Divine Spellcasting</title>\r\nYour deity bestows on you the power to cast divine spells. You can cast divine spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells (see [Casting Spells](/Rules.aspx?ID=280)). Because you're a cleric, you can usually hold a divine focus (such as a [religious symbol](/Equipment.aspx?ID=41)) for spells requiring material components instead of needing to use a [material component pouch](/Equipment.aspx?ID=33). At 1st level, you can prepare two 1st-level spells and five cantrips each morning from the common spells on the [divine spell list](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=2) or from other divine spells to which you gain access. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.\n\n As you increase in level as a cleric, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest level of spell you can cast, as shown in Table 3–9: Cleric Spells per Day on page 120.\n\n Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or your enemies to roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Wisdom, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Wisdom modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear in [Spell Attack Rolls](/Rules.aspx?ID=325). \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Heightening Spells</title> When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Cantrips</title> A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest level of cleric spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level cleric, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level cleric, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Divine Font</title>\r\nThrough your deity's blessing, you gain additional spells that channel either the life force called positive energy or its counterforce, negative energy. When you prepare your spells each day, you can prepare additional [_heal_](/Spells.aspx?ID=148) or [_harm_](/Spells.aspx?ID=146) spells, depending on your deity. The divine font spell your deity provides is listed in the Divine Font entry for your deity; if both are listed, you can choose between _heal_ or _harm_. Once you choose, you can't change your choice short of an ethical shift or divine intervention.\n\n**Healing Font**: You gain additional spell slots each day at your highest level of cleric spell slots. You can prepare only _heal_ spells in these slots, and the number of slots is equal to 1 plus your Charisma modifier.\n\n**Harmful Font**: You gain additional spell slots each day at your highest level of cleric spell slots. You can prepare only _harm_ spells in these slots, and the number of slots is equal to 1 plus your Charisma modifier.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Doctrine</title>\r\nEven among followers of the same deity, there are numerous doctrines and beliefs, which sometimes vary wildly between clerics. At 1st level, you select a doctrine and gain the benefits of its first doctrine. The doctrines presented in this book are cloistered cleric and warpriest. Each doctrine grants you initial benefits at 1st level. At 3rd, 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th levels, you gain the benefits granted by your doctrine’s second, third, fourth, fifth, and final doctrines respectively.\n\nDoctrines can be found [here](/classes/cleric/doctrines).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Cleric Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a [cleric class feat](/Classes.aspx?ID=5/feats).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Skill Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. Skill feats can be found in Chapter 5 and have the skill trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">General Feats</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter 5.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Skill Increases</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you’re untrained in, or become an expert in one skill in which you’re already trained.\n\n You can use any of these skill increases you gain at 7th level or higher to become a master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and any of these skill increases you gain at 15th level or higher to become legendary in a skill in which you’re already a master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Ability Boosts</title>\r\nAt 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Alertness</title>\r\nYou remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Ancestry Feats</title>\r\nIn addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry’s entry in Chapter 2.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 9\">Resolve</title>\r\nYou’ve steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Lightning Reflexes</title>\r\nYour reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Divine Defense</title>\r\nYour training and your deity protect you from harm. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Weapon Specialization</title>\r\nYou’ve learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master, and to 4 if you’re legendary.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 19\">Miraculous Spell</title>\r\nYou're exalted by your deity and gain truly incredible spells. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using divine spellcasting. You can't use this spell slot for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell slots or that give you more spell slots. You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, though you can take the [Maker of Miracles](/Feats.aspx?ID=309) feat to gain a second slot.","name":"Cleric","navigation":[{"label":"Details","url":"/classes/cleric"},{"label":"Feats","url":"/classes/cleric/feats"},{"label":"Sample Builds","url":"/classes/cleric/sample-builds"},{"label":"Class Kit","url":"/classes/cleric/class-kit"},{"label":"Focus Spells","url":"/classes/cleric/focus-spells"},{"label":"Doctrines","url":"/classes/cleric/doctrines"}],"perception_proficiency":"Trained","pfs":"Standard","rarity":"common","reflex_proficiency":"Trained","release_date":"2019-08-01","resistance":{},"search_markdown":"<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<additional-info>\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Core Rulebook](/Sources.aspx?ID=1) pg. 116 <sup>4.0</sup></row>\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nThe cleric is dedicated to the worship of a single deity and draws divine magic from this devotion.

Blessed with divine magic, you live the ideals of your faith, adorn yourself with the symbols of your church, and train diligently to wield your deity’s favored weapon. Your spells might protect and heal your allies, or they might punish foes and enemies of your faith, as your deity wills. Yours is a life of devotion, spreading the teachings of your faith through both word and deed. Key Ability: Wisdom At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Wisdom. Hit Points: 8 plus your Constitution modifier You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. Key Terms You'll see the following term in many cleric class features. Metamagic : These actions tweak your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell's effect, not of the metamagic action. Roleplaying the Cleric During Combat Encounters... If you’re a warpriest, you balance between casting spells and attacking with weapons— typically the favored weapon of your deity. If you’re a cloistered cleric, you primarily cast spells. Most of your spells can boost, protect, or heal your allies. Depending on your deity, you get extra spells to heal your allies or harm your enemies. During Social Encounters... You might make diplomatic overtures or deliver impressive speeches. Because you’re wise, you also pick up on falsehoods others tell. While Exploring... You detect nearby magic and interpret any religious writing you come across. You might also concentrate on a protective spell for your allies in case of attack. After a battle or hazard, you might heal anyone who was hurt. In Downtime... You might perform services at a temple, travel to spread the word of your deity, research scripture, celebrate holy days, or even found a new temple. You Might... Visit the temples and holy places sacred to your faith, and have an immediate affinity with other worshippers of your deity. Know the teachings of your religion’s holy texts and how they apply to a dilemma. Cooperate with your allies, provided they don’t ask you to go against divine will. Others Probably... Find your devotion impressive, even if they don’t understand it. Expect you to heal their wounds. Rely on you to interact with other religious figures. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics. You are untrained in anything not listed unless you gain a better proficiency rank in some other way. Perception Trained in Perception Saving Throws Trained in Fortitude Trained in Reflex Expert in Will Skills Trained in Religion Trained in one skill determined by your choice of deity Trained in a number of additional skills equal to 2 plus your Intelligence modifier Attacks Trained in simple weapons Trained in the favored weapon of your deity.

The number is equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. † The miraculous spell class feature gives you a 10th-level spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots. Ancestry and Background In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background, as described in Chapter 2. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training, noted at the start of this class. Deity As a cleric, you are a mortal servitor of a deity you revere above all others. The most common deities in Pathfinder are found here, along with their alignments, areas of concern, and the benefits you get for being a cleric of that deity. Your alignment must be one allowed by your deity, as listed in their entry. Your deity grants you the trained proficiency rank in one skill and with the deity's favored weapon. If the favored weapon is uncommon, you also get access to that weapon. Your deity also adds spells to your spell list. You can prepare these just like you can any spell on the divine spell list, once you can prepare spells of their level as a cleric. Some of these spells aren't normally on the divine list, but they're divine spells if you prepare them this way. A list of all deities can be found here. Anathema Acts fundamentally opposed to your deity's alignment or ideals are anathema to your faith. Learning or casting spells, committing acts, and using items that are anathema to your deity remove you from your deity's good graces. Casting spells with the evil trait is almost always anathema to good deities, and casting good spells is likewise anathema to evil deities; similarly, casting chaotic spells is anathema to lawful deities, and casting lawful spells is anathema to chaotic deities. A neutral cleric who worships a neutral deity isn't limited this way, but their alignment might change over time if they frequently cast spells or use abilities with a certain alignment. Similarly, casting spells that are anathema to the tenets or goals of your faith could interfere with your connection to your deity. For example, casting a spell to create undead would be anathema to Pharasma, the goddess of death. For borderline cases, you and your GM determine which acts are anathema. If you perform enough acts that are anathema to your deity, or if your alignment changes to one not allowed by your deity, you lose the magical abilities that come from your connection to your deity. The class features that you lose are determined by the GM, but they likely include your divine font and all divine spellcasting. These abilities can be regained only if you demonstrate your repentance by conducting an atone ritual. Divine Spellcasting Your deity bestows on you the power to cast divine spells. You can cast divine spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells (see Casting Spells). Because you're a cleric, you can usually hold a divine focus (such as a religious symbol) for spells requiring material components instead of needing to use a material component pouch. At 1st level, you can prepare two 1st-level spells and five cantrips each morning from the common spells on the divine spell list or from other divine spells to which you gain access. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots. As you increase in level as a cleric, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest level of spell you can cast, as shown in Table 3–9: Cleric Spells per Day on page 120. Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or your enemies to roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Wisdom, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Wisdom modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear in Spell Attack Rolls. Heightening Spells When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. Cantrips A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest level of cleric spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level cleric, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level cleric, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells. Divine Font Through your deity's blessing, you gain additional spells that channel either the life force called positive energy or its counterforce, negative energy. When you prepare your spells each day, you can prepare additional heal or harm spells, depending on your deity. The divine font spell your deity provides is listed in the Divine Font entry for your deity; if both are listed, you can choose between heal or harm . Once you choose, you can't change your choice short of an ethical shift or divine intervention. Healing Font : You gain additional spell slots each day at your highest level of cleric spell slots. You can prepare only heal spells in these slots, and the number of slots is equal to 1 plus your Charisma modifier. Harmful Font : You gain additional spell slots each day at your highest level of cleric spell slots. You can prepare only harm spells in these slots, and the number of slots is equal to 1 plus your Charisma modifier. Doctrine Even among followers of the same deity, there are numerous doctrines and beliefs, which sometimes vary wildly between clerics. At 1st level, you select a doctrine and gain the benefits of its first doctrine. The doctrines presented in this book are cloistered cleric and warpriest. Each doctrine grants you initial benefits at 1st level. At 3rd, 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th levels, you gain the benefits granted by your doctrine’s second, third, fourth, fifth, and final doctrines respectively. Doctrines can be found here. Cleric Feats At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a cleric class feat. Skill Feats At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. Skill feats can be found in Chapter 5 and have the skill trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat. General Feats At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter 5. Skill Increases At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you’re untrained in, or become an expert in one skill in which you’re already trained. You can use any of these skill increases you gain at 7th level or higher to become a master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and any of these skill increases you gain at 15th level or higher to become legendary in a skill in which you’re already a master. Ability Boosts At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18. Alertness You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert. Ancestry Feats In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry’s entry in Chapter 2. Resolve You’ve steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead. Lightning Reflexes Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert. Divine Defense Your training and your deity protect you from harm. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.

>Ancestry and Background</title>\r\nIn addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background, as described in Chapter 2.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Initial Proficiencies</title>\r\nAt 1st level you gain a number of proficiencies, representing your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Primal Spellcasting</title>\r\nThe power of the wild world flows through you. You can cast primal spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells (see [Casting Spells](/Rules.aspx?ID=280)). Because you're a druid, you can usually hold a primal focus (such as holly and mistletoe) for spells requiring material components instead of needing to use a [material component pouch](/Equipment.aspx?ID=33).\n\n At 1st level, you can prepare two 1st-level spells and five cantrips each morning from the common spells on the [primal spell list](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=4), or from other primal spells to which you gain access. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.\n\n As you increase in level as a druid, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest level of spell you can cast, as shown in Table 3–11: Druid Spells per Day.\n\n Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Wisdom, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Wisdom modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear in [Spell Attack Rolls](/Rules.aspx?ID=325). \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Heightening Spells</title> When you gain spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Cantrips</title> Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest level of druid spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level druid, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level druid, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Anathema</title>\r\nAs stewards of the natural order, druids find affronts to nature anathema. If you perform enough acts that are anathema to nature, you lose your magical abilities that come from the druid class, including your primal spellcasting and the benefits of your order. These abilities can be regained only if you demonstrate your repentance by conducting an [_atone_](/Rituals.aspx?ID=2) ritual.\n\n The following acts are anathema to all druids: \n<ul><li>Using metal armor or shields. </li><li>Despoiling natural places. </li><li>Teaching the Druidic language to non-druids.</li></ul> Each druidic order also has additional anathema acts, detailed in the order’s entry.\n\nSee specific [orders](/classes/druid/druidic-orders) for more information.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Druidic Language</title>\r\nYou know Druidic, a secret language known to only druids, in addition to any languages you know through your ancestry. Druidic has its own alphabet. Teaching the Druidic language to non-druids is anathema.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Druidic Order</title>\r\nUpon becoming a druid, you align yourself with a druidic order, which grants you a class feat, an order spell (see below), and an additional trained skill tied to your order. While you'll always be a member of your initial order, it's not unheard of for a druid to request to study with other orders in search of greater understanding of the natural world, and PC druids are among the most likely to blend the powers of different orders.\n\n Order spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to commune with local nature spirits or otherwise tend to the wilderness in a way befitting your order.\n\n Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots to cast, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Selecting druid feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 points. The full rules for focus spells are found [here](/Rules.aspx?ID=276).\n\nOrders can be found [here](/classes/druid/druidic-orders).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Shield Block</title>\r\nYou gain the [Shield Block](/Feats.aspx?ID=839) general feat, a reaction that lets you reduce damage with your shield.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Wild Empathy</title>\r\nYou have a connection to the creatures of the natural world that allows you to communicate with them on a rudimentary level. You can use Diplomacy to Make an Impression on animals and to make very simple Requests of them. In most cases, wild animals will give you time to make your case.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Druid Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a [druid class feat](/Classes.aspx?ID=6/feats).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Skill Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. Skill feats appear in Chapter 5 and have the skill trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Alertness</title>\r\nExperience has made you increasingly aware of threats around you, and you react more quickly to danger. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">General Feats</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter 5.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Great Fortitude</title>\r\nYour physique is incredibly hardy. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Skill Increases</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you’re untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you’re already trained to expert.\n\n At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you’re already a master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Ability Boosts</title>\r\nAt 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Ancestry Feats</title>\r\nIn addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry’s entry in Chapter 2.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Lightning Reflexes</title>\r\nYour reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 7\">Expert Spellcaster</title>\r\nYour command of primal forces has deepened, empowering your spells. Your proficiency ranks for primal spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Druid Weapon Expertise</title>\r\nYou have become thoroughly familiar with the weapons of your trade. Your proficiency ranks for all simple weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Resolve</title>\r\nYou’ve steeled your mind with incredible resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Medium Armor Expertise</title>\r\nYou’ve learned to defend yourself better against attacks. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Weapon Specialization</title>\r\nYou’ve learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master, and to 4 if you’re legendary.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 15\">Master Spellcaster</title>\r\nPrimal magic answers your command. Your proficiency ranks for primal spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 19\">Legendary Spellcaster</title>\r\nYou have developed an unparalleled rapport with the magic of nature. Your proficiency ranks for primal spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to legendary.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 19\">Primal Hierophant</title>\r\nYou command the most potent forces of primal magic and can cast a spell of truly incredible power. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using primal spellcasting. You can't use this spell slot for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell slots or that give you more spell slots. You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, though you can take the [Hierophant's Power](/Feats.aspx?ID=353) feat to gain a second slot.","name":"Druid","navigation":[{"label":"Details","url":"/classes/druid"},{"label":"Feats","url":"/classes/druid/feats"},{"label":"Sample Builds","url":"/classes/druid/sample-builds"},{"label":"Class Kit","url":"/classes/druid/class-kit"},{"label":"Focus Spells","url":"/classes/druid/focus-spells"},{"label":"Druidic Orders","url":"/classes/druid/druidic-orders"}],"perception_proficiency":"Trained","pfs":"Standard","rarity":"common","reflex_proficiency":"Trained","release_date":"2019-08-01","resistance":{},"search_markdown":"<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<additional-info>\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Core Rulebook](/Sources.aspx?ID=1) pg. 128 <sup>4.0</sup></row>\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nThe druid walks the wild, primordial places of the world without fear, harnessing the primal magic of nature and controlling it with calm purpose.

A …","text":" Druid Source Core Rulebook pg. 128 4.0 The power of nature is impossible to resist. It can bring ruin to the stoutest fortress in minutes, reducing even the mightiest works to rubble, burning them to ash, burying them beneath an avalanche of snow, or drowning them beneath the waves. It can provide endless bounty and breathtaking splendor to those who respect it— and an agonizing death to those who take it too lightly. You are one of those who hear nature’s call. You stand in awe of the majesty of its power and give yourself over to its service. Key Ability: Wisdom At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Wisdom. Hit Points: 8 plus your Constitution modifier You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. Key Terms You'll see the following term in many druid class features. Metamagic : These actions tweak your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell's effect, not of the metamagic action. Roleplaying the Druid During Combat Encounters... You call upon the forces of nature to defeat your enemies and protect your allies. You cast spells that draw upon primal magic to protect yourself and your friends, heal their wounds, or summon deadly animals to fight at your side. Depending on your bond to nature, you might call upon powerful elemental magic or change shape into a terrifying beast. During Social Encounters... You represent balance and a reasoned approach to problems, looking for solutions that not only are best for the natural world, but also allow the creatures within it to live in harmony and peace. You often propose compromises that allow both sides to gain what they truly need, even if they can’t have all that they desire. While Exploring... Your nature skills are invaluable. You track down enemies, navigate the wilderness, and use spells to detect magical auras around you. You might even ask wild animals to lend their extraordinary senses and scouting abilities to your group. In Downtime... You might craft magic items or potions. Alternatively, your tie to nature might lead you to tend a wilderness area, befriending beasts and healing the wounds caused by civilization. You might even teach sustainable farming and animal husbandry techniques that allow others to subsist off the land without harming the natural balance. You Might... Have a deep and meaningful respect for the power of nature. Be in constant awe of the natural world, eager to share it with others but wary of their influence upon it. Treat plants and animals as allies, working with them to reach your goals. Others Probably... View you as a representative of nature, and are sure you can control it. Assume you’re a recluse who avoids society and cities and prefers to live in the wild. Consider you a mystic, similar to a priest, but answering only to the forces of nature. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics. You are untrained in anything not listed unless you gain a better proficiency rank in some other way.

Ancestry and Background In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background, as described in Chapter 2. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level you gain a number of proficiencies, representing your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class. Primal Spellcasting The power of the wild world flows through you. You can cast primal spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells (see Casting Spells). Because you're a druid, you can usually hold a primal focus (such as holly and mistletoe) for spells requiring material components instead of needing to use a material component pouch. At 1st level, you can prepare two 1st-level spells and five cantrips each morning from the common spells on the primal spell list, or from other primal spells to which you gain access. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots. As you increase in level as a druid, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest level of spell you can cast, as shown in Table 3–11: Druid Spells per Day. Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Wisdom, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Wisdom modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear in Spell Attack Rolls. Heightening Spells When you gain spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. Cantrips Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest level of druid spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level druid, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level druid, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells. Anathema As stewards of the natural order, druids find affronts to nature anathema. If you perform enough acts that are anathema to nature, you lose your magical abilities that come from the druid class, including your primal spellcasting and the benefits of your order. These abilities can be regained only if you demonstrate your repentance by conducting an atone ritual. The following acts are anathema to all druids: Using metal armor or shields. Despoiling natural places. Teaching the Druidic language to non-druids. Each druidic order also has additional anathema acts, detailed in the order’s entry. See specific orders for more information. Druidic Language You know Druidic, a secret language known to only druids, in addition to any languages you know through your ancestry. Druidic has its own alphabet. Teaching the Druidic language to non-druids is anathema. Druidic Order Upon becoming a druid, you align yourself with a druidic order, which grants you a class feat, an order spell (see below), and an additional trained skill tied to your order. While you'll always be a member of your initial order, it's not unheard of for a druid to request to study with other orders in search of greater understanding of the natural world, and PC druids are among the most likely to blend the powers of different orders.

Selecting druid feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 points. The full rules for focus spells are found here. Orders can be found here. Shield Block You gain the Shield Block general feat, a reaction that lets you reduce damage with your shield. Wild Empathy You have a connection to the creatures of the natural world that allows you to communicate with them on a rudimentary level. You can use Diplomacy to Make an Impression on animals and to make very simple Requests of them. In most cases, wild animals will give you time to make your case. Druid Feats At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a druid class feat. Skill Feats At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. Skill feats appear in Chapter 5 and have the skill trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat. Alertness Experience has made you increasingly aware of threats around you, and you react more quickly to danger. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert. General Feats At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter 5. Great Fortitude Your physique is incredibly hardy.

You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you’re untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you’re already trained to expert. At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you’re already a master. Ability Boosts At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18. Ancestry Feats In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry’s entry in Chapter 2. Lightning Reflexes Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert. Expert Spellcaster Your command of primal forces has deepened, empowering your spells.

Your proficiency ranks for primal spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to legendary. Primal Hierophant You command the most potent forces of primal magic and can cast a spell of truly incredible power.

But when you use an incapacitation effect against a creature of higher level than you, you reduce the degree of success of your attack roll by one step, and that creature improves the degree of success of its saving throws for that effect by one step.\n\n **Ki Spells**: By tapping into a supernatural inner reserve called ki, you can create magical effects. Certain feats grant you special spells called ki spells, which are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. When you gain your first ki spell, you also gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to meditate in order to reach inner peace.\n\n When you first gain a ki spell, decide whether your ki spells are divine spells or occult spells. You become trained in spell attacks and spell DCs of that tradition and your key spellcasting ability is Wisdom.\n\n Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 points. The full rules for focus spells appear [here](/Rules.aspx?ID=276). \n\n**[Stance](/Traits.aspx?ID=152)**: A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and that you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you take an action that has the stance trait, you can't take another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Roleplaying the Monk</title>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">During Combat Encounters...</title>\r\nYou speed into the fray, dodging or leaping past obstacles with acrobatic maneuvers.

While the challenge of mastering many fighting styles drives you to great heights, you also enjoy meditating on philosophical questions and discovering new ways to obtain peace and enlightenment. Key Ability: Strength or Dexterity At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to your choice of Strength or Dexterity. Hit Points: 10 plus your Constitution modifier You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. Key Terms You'll see the following key terms in many monk abilities. Flourish : Actions with this trait are special techniques that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn. Incapacitation : An ability with this trait can take a character out of the fight. But when you use an incapacitation effect against a creature of higher level than you, you reduce the degree of success of your attack roll by one step, and that creature improves the degree of success of its saving throws for that effect by one step. Ki Spells : By tapping into a supernatural inner reserve called ki, you can create magical effects. Certain feats grant you special spells called ki spells, which are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. When you gain your first ki spell, you also gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to meditate in order to reach inner peace. When you first gain a ki spell, decide whether your ki spells are divine spells or occult spells. You become trained in spell attacks and spell DCs of that tradition and your key spellcasting ability is Wisdom. Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 points. The full rules for focus spells appear here. Stance : A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and that you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you take an action that has the stance trait, you can't take another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode. Roleplaying the Monk During Combat Encounters... You speed into the fray, dodging or leaping past obstacles with acrobatic maneuvers. You strike opponents in a rapid flurry of attacks, using your bare fists or wielding specialized weapons that you mastered during your monastic training. Stances let you change up your combat style for different situations, and ki abilities allow you to perform mystic feats like healing yourself and soaring through the air. During Social Encounters... Your perceptiveness lets you see through falsehoods, and your philosophical training provides insight into any situation. While Exploring... You climb up walls, dodge traps, overcome obstacles, and leap over pits. You usually stay toward the outside of the group to protect more vulnerable members, and you’re well suited to looking for danger or moving stealthily. In Downtime... You diligently exercise, eat healthy foods, meditate, and study various philosophies. You might also take up a craft that you strive to perfect. You Might... Maintain a regimen of physical training and meditation. Face adversity with a calm and measured approach, never panicking or succumbing to despair. Look to the future for ways you can improve, while remaining at peace with your present self. Others Probably... Marvel at your feats of physical prowess. Think you’re more than a bit uptight, given your vows and tenets. Come to you for philosophical advice.

Others say nature needs to be protected from the greedy, who wish to tame its beauty and plunder its treasures. You could champion either goal, or both. You might be a scout, tracker, or hunter of fugitives or beasts, haunting the edge of civilization or exploring the wilds. You know how to live off the land and are skilled at spotting and taking down both opportune prey and hated enemies. Key Ability: Strength or Dexterity At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to your choice of Strength or Dexterity. Hit Points: 10 plus your Constitution modifier You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. Key Terms You'll see these key terms in many ranger class features. Flourish : Actions with this trait are special techniques that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn. Open : These maneuvers work only as the first salvo in the attacks you make on your turn. You can use an action with the open trait only if you haven't used an action with the attack or open trait yet this turn. Press : Actions with this trait allow you to follow up earlier attacks. An action with the press trait can be used only if you are currently affected by a multiple attack penalty. You can't use a press action when it's not your turn, even if you use the Ready activity. Some actions with the press trait also grant an effect on a failure. The effects that are added on a failure don't apply on a critical failure. If your press action succeeds, you can choose to apply the failure effect instead. (For example, you may wish to do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance.)

Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 FP. The full rules for focus spells appear here.

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Rogue's Racket</title>\r\nAs you started on the path of the rogue, you began to develop your own style to pursue your illicit activities. Your racket shapes your rogue techniques and the way you approach a job, while building your reputation in the criminal underworld for a certain type of work. A client with deep pockets might even hire a team of rogues for a particular heist, each specializing in a different racket, in order to cover all the bases. Choose a rogue’s racket. \n\nRackets can be found [here](/classes/rogue/rackets)\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Sneak Attack</title>\r\nWhen your enemy can't properly defend itself, you take advantage to deal extra damage. If you Strike a creature that has the [flat-footed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=16) condition with an [agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170) or [finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179) melee weapon, an agile or finesse [unarmed](/Traits.aspx?ID=199) attack, a ranged weapon attack, or a ranged unarmed attack, you deal an extra 1d6 precision damage. For a ranged attack with a [thrown](/Traits.aspx?ID=195) melee weapon, that weapon must also be agile or finesse.\n\n As your rogue level increases, so does the number of damage dice for your sneak attack. Increase the number of dice by one at 5th, 11th, and 17th levels.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Surprise Attack</title>\r\nYou spring into combat faster than foes can react. On the first round of combat, if you roll Deception or Stealth for initiative, creatures that haven’t acted are flat-footed to you.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Rogue Feats</title>\r\nAt 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a [rogue class feat](/Classes.aspx?ID=10/feats).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Skill Feats</title>\r\nYou gain skill feats more often than others. At 1st level and every level thereafter, you gain a skill feat. Skill feats can be found in Chapter 5 and have the skill trait.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Skill Increases</title>\r\nYou gain more skill increases than members of other classes. At 2nd level and every level thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you’re untrained in, or to become an expert in one skill in which you’re already trained.\n\n At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you’re already a master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Deny Advantage</title>\r\nAs someone who takes advantage of others’ defenses, you are careful not to leave such openings yourself. You aren’t flat-footed to hidden, undetected, or flanking creatures of your level or lower, or creatures of your level or lower using surprise attack. However, they can still help their allies flank.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">General Feats</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter 5.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Ability Boosts</title>\r\nAt 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Ancestry Feats</title>\r\nIn addition to the initial ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry’s entry in Chapter 2.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Weapon Tricks</title>\r\nYou have become thoroughly familiar with the tools of your trade. You gain expert proficiency in simple weapons as well as the [rapier](/Weapons.aspx?ID=36), [sap](/Weapons.aspx?ID=37), [shortbow](/Weapons.aspx?ID=77), [shortsword](/Weapons.aspx?ID=43), and [unarmed](/Traits.aspx?ID=199) attacks. When you critically succeed at an attack roll against a [flat-footed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=16) creature while using an [agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170) or [finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179) simple weapon or unarmed attack, or when using any of the listed weapons, you apply the critical specialization effect for that weapon or unarmed attack.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 7\">Evasion</title>\r\nYou’ve learned to move quickly to avoid explosions, dragons’ breath, and worse. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 7\">Vigilant Senses</title>\r\nThrough your adventures, you’ve developed keen awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 7\">Weapon Specialization</title>\r\nYou’ve learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 damage if you’re a master, and 4 damage if you’re legendary.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 9\">Debilitating Strikes</title>\r\nWhen taking advantage of an opening, you both hinder and harm your foe. You gain the Debilitating Strike free action.\r\n\r\n<document level=\"4\" id=\"action-11\" />\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 9\">Great Fortitude</title>\r\nYour physique is incredibly hardy. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Rogue Expertise</title>\r\nYour techniques are now harder to resist. Your proficiency rank for your rogue class DC increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Improved Evasion</title>\r\nYou elude danger to a degree that few can match. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to legendary. When you roll a critical failure on a Reflex save, you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure on a Reflex save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Incredible Senses</title>\r\nYou notice things almost impossible for an ordinary person to detect. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to legendary.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Light Armor Expertise</title>\r\nYou’ve learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Master Tricks</title>\r\nYou’ve mastered a rogue’s fighting moves. Your proficiency ranks increase to master for all simple weapons and unarmed attacks plus the rapier, sap, shortbow, and shortsword.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 15\">Double Debilitation</title>\r\nYour opportunistic attacks are particularly detrimental. When you use Debilitating Strike, you can apply two debilitations simultaneously; removing one removes both.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 15\">Greater Weapon Specialization</title>\r\nYour damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you’re an expert, 6 if you’re a master, and 8 if you’re legendary.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 17\">Slippery Mind</title>\r\nYou play mental games and employ cognitive tricks to throw off mind-altering effects. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 19\">Light Armor Mastery</title>\r\nYour skill with light armor improves, increasing your ability to dodge blows. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 19\">Master Strike</title>\r\nYou can incapacitate an unwary foe with a single strike.

Using your sharp wits and quick reactions, you take advantage of your opponents’ missteps and strike where it hurts most. You play a dangerous game, seeking thrills and testing your skills, and likely don’t care much for any laws that happen to get in your way. While the path of every rogue is unique and riddled with danger, the one thing you all share in common is the breadth and depth of your skills. Key Ability: Dexterity or Other At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Dexterity or an option from rogue's racket. Hit Points: 8 plus your Constitution modifier You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. Key Terms You'll see the following key terms in many rogue class features. Debilitation : Debilitations apply conditions and other negative effects to a creature. When the creature is affected by a new debilitation, any previous one it was affected by ends. Flourish : Actions with this trait are special techniques that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn. Roleplaying the Rogue During Combat Encounters... You move about stealthily so you can catch foes unawares. You’re a precision instrument, more useful against a tough boss or distant spellcaster than against rank-and-file soldiers. During Social Encounters... Your skills give you multiple tools to influence your opposition. Pulling cons and ferreting out information are second nature to you. While Exploring... You sneak to get the drop on foes and scout for danger or traps. You’re a great asset, since you can disable traps, solve puzzles, and anticipate dangers. In Downtime... You might pick pockets or trade in illegal goods. You can also become part of a thieves’ guild, or even found one of your own. You Might... Hone your skills through intense practice, both on your own and out in the world. Know where to attain illicit goods. Skirt or break the law because you think it’s meaningless or have your own code. Others Probably... Find you charming or fascinating, even if they think they know better than to trust you. Come to you when they need someone who is willing to take risks or use questionable methods. Suspect you’re motivated primarily by greed.

>Ancestry and Background</title>\r\nIn addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background, as described in Chapter 2.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Initial Proficiencies</title>\r\nAt 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Bloodline</title>\r\nChoose a bloodline that gives you your spellcasting talent. This choice determines the type of spells you cast and the spell list you choose them from, additional spells you learn, and additional trained skills. You also gain Focus Points and special focus spells based on your bloodline. The bloodlines presented in this book are as follows.\n\n Bloodlines can be found [here](/classes/sorcerer/bloodlines)\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Sorcerer Spellcasting</title>\r\nYour bloodline provides you with incredible magical power. You can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells (see [Casting Spells](/Rules.aspx?ID=280)). Because you're a sorcerer, you can usually replace material components with somatic components, so you don't need to use a [material component pouch](/Equipment.aspx?ID=33).\n\n Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-level spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.\n\n As you increase in level as a sorcerer, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 3–17: Sorcerer Spells per Day.\n\n Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear in [Spell Attack Rolls](/Rules.aspx?ID=325).\n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Heightening Spells</title>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast in order to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are [heightened](/Rules.aspx?ID=273) to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.\n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Cantrips</title>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest level of sorcerer spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Spell Repertoire</title>\r\nThe collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-level spells of your choice and four cantrips of your choice, as well as an additional spell and cantrip from your [bloodline](/classes/sorcerer/bloodlines). You choose these from the common spells from the tradition corresponding to your bloodline, or from other spells from that tradition to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level.\n\n You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 3–17), you add a spell of the same level to your spell repertoire. When you gain access to a new level of spells, your first new spell is always the spell granted by your bloodline, but you can choose the other spells. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you gain a new spell from your bloodline and two other 2nd-level spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might select a higher-level version of a spell you already know so that you can cast a heightened version of that spell.\n\n Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Swapping Spells In Your Repertoire</title> As you gain new spells in your spell repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip, but you can't swap out bloodline spells. You can also swap out spells by retraining during [downtime](/Rules.aspx?ID=473).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Skill Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. Skill feats appear in Chapter 5 and have the skill trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Sorcerer Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a [sorcerer class feat](/Classes.aspx?ID=11/feats).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">General Feats</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter 5.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Signature Spells</title>\r\nYou’ve learned to cast some of your spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don’t need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you’ve learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell level at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Skill Increases</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use an increase to either become trained in one skill you’re untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you’re already trained to expert.\n\n At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you’re already a master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Ability Boosts</title>\r\nAt 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Ancestry Feats</title>\r\nIn addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry’s entry in Chapter 2.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Magical Fortitude</title>\r\nMagical power has improved your body’s resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 7\">Expert Spellcaster</title>\r\nYour inherent magic responds easily and powerfully to your command. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for spells of your bloodline’s tradition increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 9\">Lightning Reflexes</title>\r\nYour reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Alertness</title>\r\nYou remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Weapon Expertise</title>\r\nTraining and magic improved your weapon technique. Your proficiency rank for simple weapons  and unarmed attacks increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Defensive Robes</title>\r\nThe flow of magic and your defensive training combine to help you get out of the way before an attack. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Weapon Specialization</title>\r\nYou’ve learned to inflict grave wounds with your practiced weapons. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master, and 4 if you’re legendary.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 15\">Master Spellcaster</title>\r\nYou have achieved mastery over the magic in your blood. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for spells of your bloodline’s tradition increase to master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 17\">Resolve</title>\r\nYou’ve steeled you mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increase to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 19\">Bloodline Paragon</title>\r\nYou have perfected the magic in your bloodline. Add two common 10th-level spells of your tradition to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast these spells, using sorcerer spellcasting. Unlike other spell slots, you don’t gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, and they can’t be used for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell slots or abilities that give you more spell slots. You can take the [Bloodline Perfection](/Feats.aspx?ID=631) sorcerer feat to gain a second slot.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 19\">Legendary Spellcaster</title>\r\nYou demonstrate prodigious talent for spellcasting. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for spells of your bloodline’s tradition increase to legendary.","name":"Sorcerer","navigation":[{"label":"Details","url":"/classes/sorcerer"},{"label":"Feats","url":"/classes/sorcerer/feats"},{"label":"Sample Builds","url":"/classes/sorcerer/sample-builds"},{"label":"Class Kit","url":"/classes/sorcerer/class-kit"},{"label":"Focus Spells","url":"/classes/sorcerer/focus-spells"},{"label":"Bloodlines","url":"/classes/sorcerer/bloodlines"}],"perception_proficiency":"Trained","pfs":"Standard","rarity":"common","reflex_proficiency":"Trained","release_date":"2019-08-01","resistance":{},"search_markdown":"<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<additional-info>\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Core Rulebook](/Sources.aspx?ID=1) pg. 190 <sup>4.0</sup></row>\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nThe intense magic the sorcerer commands comes from neither study nor worship—it comes from their blood.

There’s magic in your blood, whether a divinity touched one of your ancestors, a forebear communed with a primal creature, or a powerful occult ritual influenced your line. Self-reflection and study allow you to refine your inherent magical skills and unlock new, more powerful abilities. The power in your blood carries a risk, however, and you constantly face the choice of whether you’ll rise to become a master spellcaster or fall into destruction. Key Ability: Charisma At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Charisma. Hit Points: 6 plus your Constitution modifier You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. Key Terms You'll see the following term in many sorcerer class features. Metamagic : These actions tweak your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell's effect, not of the metamagic action. Roleplaying the Sorcerer During Combat Encounters... You use spells to injure your enemies, influence their minds, and hamper their movements. You might be too vulnerable to get into melee combat, or your bloodline might give you abilities that help you hold your own in a brawl. While your magic is powerful, to conserve your best spells—or when you’ve used them all up—you also rely on cantrips. During Social Encounters... Your natural charisma makes you good at interacting with people. While Exploring... You detect the magic around you, finding treasures and warning your adventuring group of magical traps. When the group encounters mysteries or problems related to your bloodline, you try to solve them. In Downtime... You craft magic items or scribe scrolls. Your bloodline might drive you to research your ancestry or associate with affiliated people or creatures. You Might... Have a strong independent streak, and whether you embrace or reject your magical heritage, you long to distinguish yourself both as a spellcaster and as an individual. View your lineage with fascination, fear, or something in between—anything from wholehearted acceptance to vehement rejection. Rely on magic items, such as scrolls and wands, to supplement your limited selection of spells. Others Probably... Marvel at your ability to create magic from thin air and view your abilities with equal parts admiration and mistrust. Consider you less dedicated than studious wizards, devoted clerics, and other practitioners of magic, since power comes to you naturally. Assume you’re as unpredictable as the magic you bring forth, even if your personality proves otherwise. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics. You are untrained in anything not listed unless you gain a better proficiency rank in some other way. Perception Trained in Perception Saving Throws Trained in Fortitude Trained in Reflex Expert in Will Skills Trained in one or more skills determined by your bloodline Trained in a number of additional skills equal to 2 plus your Intelligence modifier Attacks Trained in simple weapons Trained in unarmed attacks Defenses Untrained in all armor Trained in unarmored defense Spells Trained in spell attack rolls of your spellcasting tradition, as indicated by your bloodline Trained in spell DCs of your spellcasting tradition, as indicated by your bloodline Class Features You gain these features as Sorcerer.

Ancestry and Background In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background, as described in Chapter 2. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class. Bloodline Choose a bloodline that gives you your spellcasting talent. This choice determines the type of spells you cast and the spell list you choose them from, additional spells you learn, and additional trained skills. You also gain Focus Points and special focus spells based on your bloodline. The bloodlines presented in this book are as follows. Bloodlines can be found here Sorcerer Spellcasting Your bloodline provides you with incredible magical power. You can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells (see Casting Spells). Because you're a sorcerer, you can usually replace material components with somatic components, so you don't need to use a material component pouch. Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-level spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots. As you increase in level as a sorcerer, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 3–17: Sorcerer Spells per Day. Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear in Spell Attack Rolls. Heightening Spells When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast in order to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely. Cantrips Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest level of sorcerer spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells. Spell Repertoire The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-level spells of your choice and four cantrips of your choice, as well as an additional spell and cantrip from your bloodline. You choose these from the common spells from the tradition corresponding to your bloodline, or from other spells from that tradition to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level. You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 3–17), you add a spell of the same level to your spell repertoire. When you gain access to a new level of spells, your first new spell is always the spell granted by your bloodline, but you can choose the other spells. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you gain a new spell from your bloodline and two other 2nd-level spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might select a higher-level version of a spell you already know so that you can cast a heightened version of that spell. Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa. Swapping Spells In Your Repertoire As you gain new spells in your spell repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip, but you can't swap out bloodline spells. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime. Skill Feats At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. Skill feats appear in Chapter 5 and have the skill trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat. Sorcerer Feats At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a sorcerer class feat. General Feats At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter 5. Signature Spells You’ve learned to cast some of your spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don’t need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you’ve learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell level at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does. Skill Increases At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use an increase to either become trained in one skill you’re untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you’re already trained to expert. At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you’re already a master. Ability Boosts At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18. Ancestry Feats In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry’s entry in Chapter 2. Magical Fortitude Magical power has improved your body’s resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert. Expert Spellcaster Your inherent magic responds easily and powerfully to your command. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for spells of your bloodline’s tradition increase to expert. Lightning Reflexes Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert. Alertness You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert. Weapon Expertise Training and magic improved your weapon technique. Your proficiency rank for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increases to expert. Defensive Robes The flow of magic and your defensive training combine to help you get out of the way before an attack. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert. Weapon Specialization You’ve learned to inflict grave wounds with your practiced weapons. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master, and 4 if you’re legendary. Master Spellcaster You have achieved mastery over the magic in your blood. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for spells of your bloodline’s tradition increase to master. Resolve You’ve steeled you mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increase to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead. Bloodline Paragon You have perfected the magic in your bloodline. Add two common 10th-level spells of your tradition to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast these spells, using sorcerer spellcasting. Unlike other spell slots, you don’t gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, and they can’t be used for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell slots or abilities that give you more spell slots. You can take the Bloodline Perfection sorcerer feat to gain a second slot. Legendary Spellcaster You demonstrate prodigious talent for spellcasting. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for spells of your bloodline’s tradition increase to legendary.","trait_markdown":"","type":"Class","url":"/Classes.aspx?ID=11","weakness":{},"will_proficiency":"Expert"}},{"_index":"aon18","_id":"class-12","_score":6.847722,"_source":{"ability":["Intelligence"],"attack_proficiency":["Trained in the  club ,  crossbow ,  dagger ,  heavy crossbow , and  staff","Trained in unarmed attacks"],"breadcrumbs_spa":[],"category":"class","defense_proficiency":["Untrained in all armor","Trained in unarmored defense"],"exclude_from_search":false,"fortitude_proficiency":"Trained","hp":6,"hp_raw":"6","icon_image":"/Images/Class/Wizard_Icon.png","id":"class-12","image":["/Images/Classes/Iconic_Ezren.png"],"markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Class\" pfs=\"Standard\">[Wizard](/Classes.aspx?ID=12)</title>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n<column gap=\"medium\" flex=\"1 1 400px\">\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Core Rulebook](/Sources.aspx?ID=1) pg. 202 <sup>4.0</sup></row>\n\n_You are an eternal student of the arcane secrets of the universe, using your mastery of magic to cast powerful and devastating spells.

>Ancestry and Background</title>\r\nIn addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background, as described in Chapter 2.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Initial Proficiencies</title>\r\nAt 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Arcane Spellcasting</title>\r\nThrough dedicated study and practice, you can harness arcane power to cast spells. You can cast arcane spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells (see [Casting Spells](/Rules.aspx?ID=280)).\n\n At 1st level, you can prepare up to two 1st-level spells and five cantrips each morning from the spells in your spellbook (see below), plus one extra cantrip and spell of your chosen school of each level you can cast if you are a specialist wizard. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.\n\n As you increase in level as a wizard, your number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast from spell slots increase, shown in Table 3–19: Wizard Spells per Day.\n\n Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear in [Spell Attack Rolls](/Rules.aspx?ID=325). \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Heightening Spells</title> When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Cantrips</title> Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest level of wizard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level wizard, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level wizard, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.\n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Spellbook</title> Every arcane spell has a written version, usually recorded in a spellbook. You start with a [spellbook](/Equipment.aspx?ID=53) worth 10 sp or less, which you receive for free and must study to prepare your spells each day. The spellbook contains your choice of 10 arcane cantrips and five 1st-level arcane spells. You choose these from the common spells on the [arcane](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=1) spell list or from other arcane spells you gain access to. Your spellbook's form and name are up to you. It might be a musty, leather-bound tome or an assortment of thin metal disks connected to a brass ring; its name might be esoteric, like _The Crimson Libram_, or something more academic, like _A Field Study in Practical Transmutation_.\n\n Each time you gain a level, you add two more arcane spells to your spellbook, of any level for which you have spell slots. You can also use the [Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2) skill to add other spells that you find in your adventures (See  &lt;%SKILLS.GENERAL%4%%&gt; Learn a Spell &lt;%END>).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Arcane School</title>\r\nMany arcane spellcasters delve deeply into a single school of magic in an attempt to master its secrets. If you want to be a specialist wizard, choose a school in which to specialize. You gain additional spells and spell slots for spells of your school.\n\n If you don’t choose a school, you’re a universalist, a wizard who believes that the path to true knowledge of magic requires a multidisciplinary understanding of all eight schools working together. Though a universalist lacks the focus of a specialist wizard, they have greater fiexibility.\n\nArcane schools can be found [here](/classes/wizard/arcane-schools)\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Arcane Bond</title>\r\nYou place some of your magical power in a bonded item. Each day when you prepare your spells, you can designate a single item you own as your bonded item. This is typically an item associated with spellcasting, such as a wand, ring, or staff, but you are free to designate a weapon or other item. You gain the Drain Bonded Item free action.\r\n\r\n<document level=\"4\" id=\"action-13\" />\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Arcane Thesis</title>\r\nDuring your studies to become a full-fledged wizard, you produced a thesis of unique magical research on one of a variety of topics. You gain a special benefit depending on the topic of your thesis research. The arcane thesis topics presented in this book are below; your specific thesis probably has a much longer and more technical title like “On the Methods of Spell Interpolation and the Genesis of a New Understanding of the Building Blocks of Magic.”\n\nArcane theses can be found [here](/classes/wizard/arcane-theses).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Skill Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. Skill feats can be found in Chapter 5 and have the skill trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Wizard Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a wizard [class feat](/Classes.aspx?ID=12/feats).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">General Feats</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter 5.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Skill Increases</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you’re untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you’re already trained to expert.\n\n At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you’re already a master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Ability Boosts</title>\r\nAt 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Ancestry Feats</title>\r\nIn addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry’s entry in Chapter 2.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Lightning Reflexes</title>\r\nYour reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 7\">Expert Spellcaster</title>\r\nExtended practice of the arcane has improved your capabilities. Your proficiency ranks for arcane spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 9\">Magical Fortitude</title>\r\nMagical power has improved your body’s resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Alertness</title>\r\nYou remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Wizard Weapon Expertise</title>\r\nThrough a combination of magic and training, you’ve learned how to wield wizard weapons more effectively. You gain expert proficiency in the club, crossbow, dagger, heavy crossbow, staff, and unarmed attacks.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Defensive Robes</title>\r\nThe flow of magic and your training combine to help you avoid attacks. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Weapon Specialization</title>\r\nYou’ve learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal an additional 2 damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master, and 4 if you’re legendary.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 15\">Master Spellcaster</title>\r\nYou command superlative spellcasting ability. Your proficiency ranks for arcane spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 17\">Resolve</title>\r\nYou’ve steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 19\">Archwizard's Spellcraft</title>\r\nYou command the most potent arcane magic and can cast a spell of truly incredible power. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using arcane spellcasting. You can't use this spell slot for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell slots or that give you more spell slots. Unlike with other spell slots, you don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, though you can take the [Archwizard's Might](/Feats.aspx?ID=662) feat to gain a second slot.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 19\">Legendary Spellcaster</title>\r\nYou are a consummate spellcaster, with a comprehensive understanding of both arcane theory and practical spellcraft. Your proficiency ranks for arcane spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to legendary.","name":"Wizard","navigation":[{"label":"Details","url":"/classes/wizard"},{"label":"Feats","url":"/classes/wizard/feats"},{"label":"Sample Builds","url":"/classes/wizard/sample-builds"},{"label":"Class Kit","url":"/classes/wizard/class-kit"},{"label":"Focus Spells","url":"/classes/wizard/focus-spells"},{"label":"Arcane Schools","url":"/classes/wizard/arcane-schools"},{"label":"Arcane Theses","url":"/classes/wizard/arcane-theses"}],"perception_proficiency":"Trained","pfs":"Standard","rarity":"common","reflex_proficiency":"Trained","release_date":"2019-08-01","resistance":{},"search_markdown":"<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<additional-info>\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Core Rulebook](/Sources.aspx?ID=1) pg. 202 <sup>4.0</sup></row>\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nThe wizard is the arcane master of spellcasting, plucking incredible power from reality through complicated spell formulas.

You likely try to stay out of the fray, carefully judging when to use your spells. You save your most powerful magic to incapacitate threatening foes and use your cantrips when only weaker foes remain. When enemies pull out tricks like invisibility or flight , you answer with spells like glitterdust or earth bind , leveling the field for your allies. During Social Encounters... You provide a well of knowledge about arcane matters and solve arguments with logic. While Exploring... You locate magical auras and determine the arcane significance of magical writing or phenomena you uncover. When you run across an unusual obstacle to further exploration, you probably have a scroll that will make it easier to overcome. In Downtime... You learn new spells, craft magic items, or scribe scrolls for your party, and seek out new and exciting formulas in addition to spells. You might even forge scholarly connections and establish a school or guild of your own. You Might... Have an unquenchable intellectual curiosity about how everything in the world around you works—magic in particular. Believe fervently that your school of magic is superior (if you’re a specialist) or that true mastery of magic requires knowledge of all schools (if you’re a universalist). Use esoteric jargon and technical terms to precisely describe the minutiae of magical effects, even though the difference is probably lost on other people. Others Probably... Consider you to be incredibly powerful and potentially dangerous. Fear what your magic can do to their minds, bodies, and souls, and ask that you avoid casting spells in polite company, as few can identify whether one of your spells is harmless or malevolent until it’s too late. Assume you can easily solve all their problems, from dangerous weather to poor crop yields, and ask you for spells that can help them get whatever they desire.

Ancestry and Background In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background, as described in Chapter 2. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class. Arcane Spellcasting Through dedicated study and practice, you can harness arcane power to cast spells. You can cast arcane spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells (see Casting Spells). At 1st level, you can prepare up to two 1st-level spells and five cantrips each morning from the spells in your spellbook (see below), plus one extra cantrip and spell of your chosen school of each level you can cast if you are a specialist wizard. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots. As you increase in level as a wizard, your number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast from spell slots increase, shown in Table 3–19: Wizard Spells per Day. Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear in Spell Attack Rolls. Heightening Spells When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. Cantrips Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest level of wizard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level wizard, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level wizard, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells. Spellbook Every arcane spell has a written version, usually recorded in a spellbook. You start with a spellbook worth 10 sp or less, which you receive for free and must study to prepare your spells each day. The spellbook contains your choice of 10 arcane cantrips and five 1st-level arcane spells. You choose these from the common spells on the arcane spell list or from other arcane spells you gain access to. Your spellbook's form and name are up to you. It might be a musty, leather-bound tome or an assortment of thin metal disks connected to a brass ring; its name might be esoteric, like The Crimson Libram , or something more academic, like A Field Study in Practical Transmutation . Each time you gain a level, you add two more arcane spells to your spellbook, of any level for which you have spell slots. You can also use the Arcana skill to add other spells that you find in your adventures (See &lt;%SKILLS.GENERAL%4%%&gt; Learn a Spell &lt;%END>). Arcane School Many arcane spellcasters delve deeply into a single school of magic in an attempt to master its secrets. If you want to be a specialist wizard, choose a school in which to specialize. You gain additional spells and spell slots for spells of your school. If you don’t choose a school, you’re a universalist, a wizard who believes that the path to true knowledge of magic requires a multidisciplinary understanding of all eight schools working together. Though a universalist lacks the focus of a specialist wizard, they have greater fiexibility. Arcane schools can be found here Arcane Bond You place some of your magical power in a bonded item. Each day when you prepare your spells, you can designate a single item you own as your bonded item. This is typically an item associated with spellcasting, such as a wand, ring, or staff, but you are free to designate a weapon or other item. You gain the Drain Bonded Item free action. Arcane Thesis During your studies to become a full-fledged wizard, you produced a thesis of unique magical research on one of a variety of topics. You gain a special benefit depending on the topic of your thesis research. The arcane thesis topics presented in this book are below; your specific thesis probably has a much longer and more technical title like “On the Methods of Spell Interpolation and the Genesis of a New Understanding of the Building Blocks of Magic.” Arcane theses can be found here. Skill Feats At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. Skill feats can be found in Chapter 5 and have the skill trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat. Wizard Feats At 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a wizard class feat. General Feats At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter 5. Skill Increases At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you’re untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you’re already trained to expert. At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you’re already a master. Ability Boosts At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18. Ancestry Feats In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry’s entry in Chapter 2. Lightning Reflexes Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert. Expert Spellcaster Extended practice of the arcane has improved your capabilities. Your proficiency ranks for arcane spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert. Magical Fortitude Magical power has improved your body’s resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert. Alertness You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert. Wizard Weapon Expertise Through a combination of magic and training, you’ve learned how to wield wizard weapons more effectively. You gain expert proficiency in the club, crossbow, dagger, heavy crossbow, staff, and unarmed attacks. Defensive Robes The flow of magic and your training combine to help you avoid attacks. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert. Weapon Specialization You’ve learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal an additional 2 damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master, and 4 if you’re legendary. Master Spellcaster You command superlative spellcasting ability. Your proficiency ranks for arcane spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master. Resolve You’ve steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead. Archwizard's Spellcraft You command the most potent arcane magic and can cast a spell of truly incredible power. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using arcane spellcasting. You can't use this spell slot for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell slots or that give you more spell slots. Unlike with other spell slots, you don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, though you can take the Archwizard's Might feat to gain a second slot. Legendary Spellcaster You are a consummate spellcaster, with a comprehensive understanding of both arcane theory and practical spellcraft. Your proficiency ranks for arcane spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to legendary.","trait_markdown":"","type":"Class","url":"/Classes.aspx?ID=12","weakness":{},"will_proficiency":"Expert"}},{"_index":"aon18","_id":"class-13","_score":6.847722,"_source":{"ability":["Intelligence"],"attack_proficiency":["Trained in simple and martial weapons","Trained in unarmed attacks"],"breadcrumbs_spa":[],"category":"class","defense_proficiency":["Trained in light armor","Trained in unarmored defense"],"exclude_from_search":false,"fortitude_proficiency":"Trained","hp":8,"hp_raw":"8","icon_image":"/Images/Class/Investigator_Icon.png","id":"class-13","image":["/Images/Classes/Iconic_Quinn.png"],"markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Class\" pfs=\"Standard\">[Investigator](/Classes.aspx?ID=13)</title>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n<column gap=\"medium\" flex=\"1 1 400px\">\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Advanced Player's Guide](/Sources.aspx?ID=39) pg. 54 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n_You seek to uncover the truth, doggedly pursuing leads to reveal the plots of devious villains, discover ancient secrets, or unravel other mysteries.

Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class. On the Case As an investigator, you think of your adventures as cases waiting to be solved. You gain one activity and one reaction you can use to investigate cases: Pursue a Lead and Clue In. Devise a Stratagem You can play out a battle in your head, using brains rather than brawn to execute an attack. Methodology Your studies have made you savvy in many areas, but one in particular drew your intense interest. Choose a methodology. Methodologies can be found here. Investigator Feats At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain an investigator class feat. Strategic Strike When you strike carefully and with forethought, you deal a telling blow. When making a Strike that adds your Intelligence modifier on your attack roll due to Devising a Stratagem, you deal an additional 1d6 precision damage. As your investigator level increases, so too does the deadliness of your strategic strike. Increase the number of dice by one at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels. Skill Feats At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat. Skill Increases You gain more skill increases than members of other classes. At 2nd level and every level thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in or to become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained. At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master. General Feats At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. Keen Recollection You can recall pertinent facts on topics that aren't your specialty. Your proficiency bonus to untrained skill checks to Recall Knowledge is equal to your level instead of +0. Skillful Lessons At 3rd level and every odd-numbered level thereafter, you gain a skill feat. This feat must be for an Intelligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based skill, or for the skill you gained from your methodology. Ability Boosts At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18. Ancestry Feats In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. Weapon Expertise You've dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to expert. Vigilant Senses Through your adventures, you've developed keen awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank in Perception increases to master. Weapon Specialization You can inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master and 4 if you're legendary. Great Fortitude Your physique is incredibly hardy. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert. Investigator Expertise You've refined your investigative techniques to an exceptional degree. Your circumstance bonus from Pursue a Lead increases to +2. Your proficiency rank for your investigator class DC increases to expert. Deductive Improvisation You use your skills at deduction to perform whatever task is necessary to solve the case. You can attempt any check that requires you to be trained in a skill, even if you're untrained in it; you can attempt any check that requires you to have expert proficiency in a skill so long as you're trained in it; and you can attempt any check that requires you to have master proficiency in a skill as long as you have expert proficiency in it. Resolve You've steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead. Incredible Senses You notice things that are almost impossible for an ordinary person to detect. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to legendary. Light Armor Expertise You've learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to expert. Weapon Mastery You fully understand your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to master. Evasion You've learned to move quickly to avoid explosions, a dragon's breath, and worse. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead. Greater Weapon Specialization Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary. Greater Resolve Your unbelievable training grants you mental resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to legendary. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success. When you roll a critical failure on a Will save, you get a failure instead. When you fail a Will save against a damaging effect, you take half damage. Light Armor Mastery Your skill with light armor improves, increasing your ability to dodge blows. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to master. Master Detective As a master detective, you can solve any case and find all the clues available. If you're pursuing the subject of a lead and you enter a new location that includes another clue toward solving the mystery, the GM informs you of the existence of the clue and its type: an object, person, spell effect, or the like. When you find the clue, the GM informs you that you've done so. If there is more than one clue in the location, the GM chooses one to inform you about. When you find any of the clues in that location, the GM informs you that you've done so, even if it wasn't the clue they'd chosen or there are other clues you haven't found. Your proficiency rank for your investigator class DC increases to master.","trait_markdown":"","type":"Class","url":"/Classes.aspx?ID=13","weakness":{},"will_proficiency":"Expert"}},{"_index":"aon18","_id":"class-14","_score":6.847722,"_source":{"ability":["Charisma"],"attack_proficiency":["Trained in simple weapons","Trained in unarmed attacks"],"breadcrumbs_spa":[],"category":"class","defense_proficiency":["Trained in light armor","Trained in unarmored defense"],"exclude_from_search":false,"fortitude_proficiency":"Trained","hp":8,"hp_raw":"8","icon_image":"/Images/Class/Oracle_Icon.png","id":"class-14","image":["/Images/Classes/Iconic_Korakai.png"],"markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Class\" pfs=\"Standard\">[Oracle](/Classes.aspx?ID=14)</title>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n<column gap=\"medium\" flex=\"1 1 400px\">\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Advanced Player's Guide](/Sources.aspx?ID=39) pg. 66 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n_Your conduit to divine power eschews the traditional channels of prayer and servitude—you instead glean divine truths that extend beyond any single deity. You understand the great mysteries of the universe embodied in overarching concepts that transcend good and evil or chaos and law, whether because you perceive the common ground across multiple deities or circumvent their power entirely. You explore one of these mysteries and draw upon its power to cast miraculous spells, but that power comes with a terrible price: a curse that grows stronger the more you draw upon it. Your abilities are a double-edged sword, which you might uphold as an instrument of the divine or view as a curse from the gods._\r\n\r\n**Key Ability: Charisma** <br />\r\nAt 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Charisma.\r\n\r\n**Hit Points: 8 plus your Constitution modifier** <br />\r\nYou increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Classes/Iconic_Korakai.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Key Terms</title>\r\n\r\nYou'll see these key terms in many oracle class features.\n\n **[Cursebound](/Traits.aspx?ID=320)**: Spells with this trait increase the severity of your oracular curse when cast. Usually only revelation spells have this trait. You can't cast a cursebound spell if you don't have an oracular curse.\n\n **[Fortune](/Traits.aspx?ID=76) and [Misfortune](/Traits.aspx?ID=110)**: Fortune and misfortune effects can alter how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one fortune and one misfortune effect come into play on a single roll. If multiple fortune effects would apply, you must pick which to use. If two misfortune effects apply, the GM decides which is worse and applies it. If both a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.\n\n **[Metamagic](/Traits.aspx?ID=107)**: Actions with the metamagic trait tweak the properties of your spells. These actions usually come from metamagic feats. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell's effect, not of the metamagic action itself.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Other Focus Spells</title>\r\n\r\nYou might gain focus spells that aren't revelation spells and don't have the [cursebound](/Traits.aspx?ID=320) trait (by taking an archetype, for instance). Since these spells aren't drawing on the same divine mystery as your revelation spells, casting them doesn't increase the effects of your curse. They still cost Focus Points as normal, and you still can't increase your focus pool to hold more than 3 Focus Points.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Roleplaying the Oracle</title>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">During Combat Encounters...</title>\r\nYou draw upon your mystery to empower yourself in combat, balancing miraculous effects with the increasing severity of your curse as conflicting divine demands overtax your physical body. You cast spells to aid your allies and devastate your foes, or depending on your mystery, you might wade into battle yourself.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">During Social Encounters...</title>\r\nYou rely upon the insights drawn from your mystery. You might leverage your curse to intimidate people or hide its effects to better blend in.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">While Exploring...</title>\r\nYou recenter yourself to bring the terrible metaphysical conflicts causing your curse back under control so you can draw upon your mystery's power again later. You remain aware of supernatural forces acting around you, perhaps peeking into the future to gain insights.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">In Downtime...</title>\r\nYou might seek to learn more about your mystery and the divine wellsprings that fuel your power.

Background</title>\r\nIn addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Initial Proficiencies</title>\r\nAt 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Divine Spellcasting</title>\r\nYour mystery provides you with divine magical power. You can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Your unconventional access to this divine power means you can usually replace material components with somatic components, so you don't need to use a [material component pouch](/Equipment.aspx?ID=33) when casting spells.\n\n At 1st level, you can cast up to two 1st-level spells per day. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots. As you increase in level as an oracle, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 2–3: Oracle Spells per Day.\n\n Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Heightening Spells</title> When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. To cast a heightened spell, you must have the heightened version in your repertoire; for example, you can't cast a 3rd-level version of a spell that is only in your repertoire at 1st level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Cantrips</title>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest level of oracle spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level oracle, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level oracle, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Spell Repertoire</title>\r\nThe collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-level spells of your choice and five cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the divine spell list, or from other divine spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level.\n\n You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2–3), you add a spell of the same level to your spell repertoire. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select two 2nd-level spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-level version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.\n\n Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Swapping Spells In Your Repertoire</title> As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. You can also instead swap a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Mystery</title>\r\nAn oracle wields divine power, but not from a single divine being. This power could come from a potent concept or ideal, the attention of multiple divine entities whose areas of concern all touch on that subject, or a direct and dangerous conduit to raw divine power. This is the oracle's mystery, a source of divine magic not beholden to any deity. \n\nChoose the mystery that empowers your magic. Your mystery grants you special spells called revelation spells and might later grant you divine domain spells. It dictates the effects of your oracular curse, adds an additional cantrip to your repertoire, and gives you one or more trained skills. Drawing insight and power from the collective divine influences that fuel your magic also provides you with a special benefit.\n\nThe list of oracle mysteries can be found [here](/classes/oracle/mysteries).  \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Revelation Spells</title> The powers of your mystery manifest in the form of revelation spells, which are a type of focus spell. Casting a revelation spell costs 1 Focus Point and increases the effects of your oracular curse. You start with a focus pool of 2 Focus Points. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the [Refocus](/Actions.aspx?ID=71) activity to reconcile the conflicting or unconventional nature of your divine mystery.\n\n Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots (see Divine Spellcasting). Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points. The full rules for focus spells appear [here](/Rules.aspx?ID=276).\n\n Revelation spells have the cursebound trait, unlike other focus spells. This trait means they increase the severity of your oracular curse (see below) when cast. You can't cast a cursebound spell if you don't have an oracular curse.\n\n You learn two revelation spells at 1st level. The first is an initial revelation spell determined by your mystery. The second is an initial domain spell you select from one of the domains associated with your mystery, which you cast as a revelation spell, causing it to gain the [cursebound](/Traits.aspx?ID=320) trait. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Oracular Curse</title> Drawing on multiple disparate sources of power inevitably places an incredible stress on your body, manifesting as a supernatural curse. The more revelation spells you cast, the worse the effects of your curse, but these increasingly conflicting energies can also provide you with divine benefits.\n\n The specific effects of your curse are tied to your mystery, but all curses follow the same progression. A curse continually gives you a mild but constant reminder that you carry otherworldly power. As you cast revelation spells, your curse intensifies, first to a minor effect and then to a moderate effect.\n\n Your curse progresses to its minor stage the first time you finish casting a revelation spell after your daily preparations. Once your minor curse has manifested, it remains in effect until you rest for 8 hours and again make your daily preparations. If you cast a revelation spell while your minor curse is in effect, you progress to the moderate curse effect immediately after you finish Casting the Spell. The minor effect continues to affect you, though some moderate curse effects might alter the specifics of your minor curse. At higher levels, you can cast more revelation spells, progressing your curse to its major stage and then an extreme stage; these stronger curses are cumulative with the effects of the lower stages and can alter them. When you Refocus while under the effects of your moderate or stronger curse, you reduce your curse's severity to minor in addition to regaining a Focus Point.\n\n Drawing upon your mystery's power while your curse is at its worst causes an irreconcilable conflict between you and the sources of your power. Immediately after casting a revelation spell while under the moderate effect of your curse, you are overwhelmed. While overwhelmed, you can't Cast or Sustain any revelation spells— you effectively lose access to those spells. You can still Refocus to reduce the effects of your curse and regain a Focus Point, but doing so doesn't allow you to cast further revelation spells. These effects last until you rest for 8 hours and make your daily preparations, at which point your curse returns to its basic state. At higher levels, you can grow to withstand your curse's major and even extreme effects, enabling you to cast more revelation spells without becoming overwhelmed.\n\n Your curse has the [curse](/Traits.aspx?ID=38), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), and [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117) traits. You can't mitigate, reduce, or remove the effects of your oracular curse by any means other than Refocusing and resting for 8 hours. For example, if your curse makes creatures [concealed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=4) from you, you can't negate that concealed condition through a magic item or spell, such as [_true strike_](/Spells.aspx?ID=345) (though you would still benefit from the other effects of that item or spell). Likewise, [_remove curse_](/Spells.aspx?ID=250) and similar spells don't affect your curse at all.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Oracle Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain an [oracle class feat](/Classes.aspx?ID=14/feats).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Skill Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">General Feats</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Signature Spells</title>\r\nExperience enables you to cast some spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can replace it with any spell you could have chosen when you first selected it (i.e., of the same spell level or lower). You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Skill Increases</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase.

Once every 10 minutes, when you fail an attack roll, skill or Perception check, or saving throw, you can reroll it and use the second result. The reroll has the [fortune](/Traits.aspx?ID=76) trait and doesn't require you to spend an action, meaning you can use the reroll even if you can't act. These effects are in addition to all the effects of your major curse, and they can't be removed by any means until you Refocus to reduce your curse to its minor effect.\n\n If you cast a revelation spell while under the effects of this extreme curse, you are overwhelmed by your curse, and you remain doomed 2 even if you [Refocus](/Actions.aspx?ID=71).

You understand the great mysteries of the universe embodied in overarching concepts that transcend good and evil or chaos and law, whether because you perceive the common ground across multiple deities or circumvent their power entirely. You explore one of these mysteries and draw upon its power to cast miraculous spells, but that power comes with a terrible price: a curse that grows stronger the more you draw upon it. Your abilities are a double-edged sword, which you might uphold as an instrument of the divine or view as a curse from the gods. Key Ability: Charisma At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Charisma. Hit Points: 8 plus your Constitution modifier You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. Key Terms You'll see these key terms in many oracle class features. Cursebound : Spells with this trait increase the severity of your oracular curse when cast. Usually only revelation spells have this trait. You can't cast a cursebound spell if you don't have an oracular curse. Fortune and Misfortune : Fortune and misfortune effects can alter how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one fortune and one misfortune effect come into play on a single roll. If multiple fortune effects would apply, you must pick which to use. If two misfortune effects apply, the GM decides which is worse and applies it. If both a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally. Metamagic : Actions with the metamagic trait tweak the properties of your spells. These actions usually come from metamagic feats. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell's effect, not of the metamagic action itself. Other Focus Spells You might gain focus spells that aren't revelation spells and don't have the cursebound trait (by taking an archetype, for instance). Since these spells aren't drawing on the same divine mystery as your revelation spells, casting them doesn't increase the effects of your curse. They still cost Focus Points as normal, and you still can't increase your focus pool to hold more than 3 Focus Points. Roleplaying the Oracle During Combat Encounters... You draw upon your mystery to empower yourself in combat, balancing miraculous effects with the increasing severity of your curse as conflicting divine demands overtax your physical body. You cast spells to aid your allies and devastate your foes, or depending on your mystery, you might wade into battle yourself. During Social Encounters... You rely upon the insights drawn from your mystery. You might leverage your curse to intimidate people or hide its effects to better blend in. While Exploring... You recenter yourself to bring the terrible metaphysical conflicts causing your curse back under control so you can draw upon your mystery's power again later. You remain aware of supernatural forces acting around you, perhaps peeking into the future to gain insights. In Downtime... You might seek to learn more about your mystery and the divine wellsprings that fuel your power. Associating with others interested in the subject of your mystery can make it easier to live with your curse. You could associate with an organized religion or even start your own faithful following devoted to your mystery. You Might... View your oracular powers as a blessing, a curse, or both. Push yourself to the limits of what you can withstand to work great acts of magic. Rely on magical items to provide a pool of safer and more reliable magic. Others Probably... Don't realize your spellcasting draws upon divine power and instead believe you command stranger—and possibly evil—powers. Assume you performed some terrible transgression to become cursed by the gods. Admire your determination and the sacrifices you make to perform wondrous acts. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics. You are untrained in anything not listed unless you gain a better proficiency rank in some other way.

Ancestry and Background In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class. Divine Spellcasting Your mystery provides you with divine magical power. You can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Your unconventional access to this divine power means you can usually replace material components with somatic components, so you don't need to use a material component pouch when casting spells. At 1st level, you can cast up to two 1st-level spells per day. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots. As you increase in level as an oracle, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 2–3: Oracle Spells per Day. Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier. Heightening Spells When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. To cast a heightened spell, you must have the heightened version in your repertoire; for example, you can't cast a 3rd-level version of a spell that is only in your repertoire at 1st level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely. Cantrips Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest level of oracle spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level oracle, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level oracle, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells. Spell Repertoire The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-level spells of your choice and five cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the divine spell list, or from other divine spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level. You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2–3), you add a spell of the same level to your spell repertoire. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select two 2nd-level spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-level version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell. Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa. Swapping Spells In Your Repertoire As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. You can also instead swap a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime. Mystery An oracle wields divine power, but not from a single divine being. This power could come from a potent concept or ideal, the attention of multiple divine entities whose areas of concern all touch on that subject, or a direct and dangerous conduit to raw divine power. This is the oracle's mystery, a source of divine magic not beholden to any deity. Choose the mystery that empowers your magic. Your mystery grants you special spells called revelation spells and might later grant you divine domain spells. It dictates the effects of your oracular curse, adds an additional cantrip to your repertoire, and gives you one or more trained skills. Drawing insight and power from the collective divine influences that fuel your magic also provides you with a special benefit. The list of oracle mysteries can be found here. Revelation Spells The powers of your mystery manifest in the form of revelation spells, which are a type of focus spell. Casting a revelation spell costs 1 Focus Point and increases the effects of your oracular curse. You start with a focus pool of 2 Focus Points. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to reconcile the conflicting or unconventional nature of your divine mystery. Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots (see Divine Spellcasting). Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points. The full rules for focus spells appear here. Revelation spells have the cursebound trait, unlike other focus spells. This trait means they increase the severity of your oracular curse (see below) when cast. You can't cast a cursebound spell if you don't have an oracular curse. You learn two revelation spells at 1st level. The first is an initial revelation spell determined by your mystery. The second is an initial domain spell you select from one of the domains associated with your mystery, which you cast as a revelation spell, causing it to gain the cursebound trait. Oracular Curse Drawing on multiple disparate sources of power inevitably places an incredible stress on your body, manifesting as a supernatural curse. The more revelation spells you cast, the worse the effects of your curse, but these increasingly conflicting energies can also provide you with divine benefits. The specific effects of your curse are tied to your mystery, but all curses follow the same progression. A curse continually gives you a mild but constant reminder that you carry otherworldly power. As you cast revelation spells, your curse intensifies, first to a minor effect and then to a moderate effect. Your curse progresses to its minor stage the first time you finish casting a revelation spell after your daily preparations. Once your minor curse has manifested, it remains in effect until you rest for 8 hours and again make your daily preparations. If you cast a revelation spell while your minor curse is in effect, you progress to the moderate curse effect immediately after you finish Casting the Spell. The minor effect continues to affect you, though some moderate curse effects might alter the specifics of your minor curse. At higher levels, you can cast more revelation spells, progressing your curse to its major stage and then an extreme stage; these stronger curses are cumulative with the effects of the lower stages and can alter them. When you Refocus while under the effects of your moderate or stronger curse, you reduce your curse's severity to minor in addition to regaining a Focus Point. Drawing upon your mystery's power while your curse is at its worst causes an irreconcilable conflict between you and the sources of your power. Immediately after casting a revelation spell while under the moderate effect of your curse, you are overwhelmed. While overwhelmed, you can't Cast or Sustain any revelation spells— you effectively lose access to those spells. You can still Refocus to reduce the effects of your curse and regain a Focus Point, but doing so doesn't allow you to cast further revelation spells. These effects last until you rest for 8 hours and make your daily preparations, at which point your curse returns to its basic state. At higher levels, you can grow to withstand your curse's major and even extreme effects, enabling you to cast more revelation spells without becoming overwhelmed. Your curse has the curse, divine, and necromancy traits. You can't mitigate, reduce, or remove the effects of your oracular curse by any means other than Refocusing and resting for 8 hours. For example, if your curse makes creatures concealed from you, you can't negate that concealed condition through a magic item or spell, such as true strike (though you would still benefit from the other effects of that item or spell). Likewise, remove curse and similar spells don't affect your curse at all. Oracle Feats At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain an oracle class feat. Skill Feats At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat. General Feats At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. Signature Spells Experience enables you to cast some spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can replace it with any spell you could have chosen when you first selected it (i.e., of the same spell level or lower). You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does. Skill Increases At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained. At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master. Ability Boosts At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if starts out below 18. Ancestry Feats In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. Expert Spellcaster The intricacy of your divine power has grown clearer over time. Your proficiency ranks for divine spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert. Resolve You've steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead. Magical Fortitude Magical power has improved your body's resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert. Alertness You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert. Major Curse You've learned to better balance the conflicting powers wreaking havoc on your body. Immediately after completing the casting of a revelation spell while you are affected by your moderate curse, your curse progresses to its major effect, rather than overwhelming you. This effect lasts until you Refocus, which reduces your curse to its minor effect. If you cast a revelation spell while under the effects of your major curse, you are overwhelmed by your curse. In addition, increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool from 2 to 3. If you spend at least 2 Focus Points before you again Refocus, you recover 2 Focus Points when you Refocus instead of 1. Weapon Expertise You've dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert. Light Armor Expertise You've learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor. Your proficiency rank for light armor and unarmored defense increases to expert. Lightning Reflexes Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert. Weapon Specialization You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master and 4 if you're legendary. Master Spellcaster You truly understand the deep and complex divine power within your mystery. Your proficiency ranks for divine spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master. Extreme Curse You have mastered a perilous balance between the conflicting divine powers of your mystery, gaining the power to change your fate, but straining both body and soul. When you cast a revelation spell while affected by your major curse, your curse intensifies to an extreme effect instead of overwhelming you. All mysteries share the same effects for their extreme curse. When affected by your extreme curse, you become doomed 2 (or increase your doomed condition by 2 if you were already doomed). Once every 10 minutes, when you fail an attack roll, skill or Perception check, or saving throw, you can reroll it and use the second result. The reroll has the fortune trait and doesn't require you to spend an action, meaning you can use the reroll even if you can't act. These effects are in addition to all the effects of your major curse, and they can't be removed by any means until you Refocus to reduce your curse to its minor effect. If you cast a revelation spell while under the effects of this extreme curse, you are overwhelmed by your curse, and you remain doomed 2 even if you Refocus. Additionally, if you spend at least 3 Focus Points before you again Refocus, you recover 3 Focus Points when you Refocus instead of 1. Greater Resolve Your unbelievable training grants you mental resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to legendary. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead. When you roll a critical failure on a Will save, you get a failure instead. When you fail a Will save against a damaging effect, you take half damage. Legendary Spellcaster You can harness divine power at a level few others can match. Your proficiency ranks for divine spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to legendary. Oracular Clarity You now fully grasp the nature of the divine power behind your mystery, allowing you to work magic akin to miracles. Add two common 10th-level divine spells to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast one of those two spells using oracle spellcasting. You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, unlike other spell slots, and you can't use 10th-level slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. You can take the Oracular Providence feat to gain a second slot.","trait_markdown":"","type":"Class","url":"/Classes.aspx?ID=14","weakness":{},"will_proficiency":"Expert"}},{"_index":"aon18","_id":"class-15","_score":6.847722,"_source":{"ability":["Dexterity"],"attack_proficiency":["Trained in simple weapons","Trained in martial weapons","Trained in unarmed attacks"],"breadcrumbs_spa":[],"category":"class","defense_proficiency":["Trained in light armor","Trained in unarmored defense"],"exclude_from_search":false,"fortitude_proficiency":"Trained","hp":10,"hp_raw":"10","icon_image":"/Images/Class/Swashbuckler_Icon.png","id":"class-15","image":["/Images/Classes/Iconic_Jirelle.png"],"markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Class\" pfs=\"Standard\">[Swashbuckler](/Classes.aspx?ID=15)</title>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n<column gap=\"medium\" flex=\"1 1 400px\">\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Advanced Player's Guide](/Sources.aspx?ID=39) pg. 82 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n_Many warriors rely on brute force, weighty armor, or cumbersome weapons.

Effects added on a failure don't apply on a critical failure. If your finisher action succeeds, you can still choose to apply the failure effect instead. For example, you might do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance. \n\n[**Flourish**](/Traits.aspx?ID=73): Actions with this trait are special techniques that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn. \n\n**[Stance](/Traits.aspx?ID=152)**: A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and you remain in that stance for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you use an action with the stance trait, you can't use another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Roleplaying the Swashbuckler</title>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">During Combat Encounters...</title>\r\nYou show off to gain panache, leveraging your flair to build up to powerful finishing moves.

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Panache</title>\r\nYou care as much about the way you accomplish something as whether you actually accomplish it in the first place. When you perform an action with particular bravado, you can leverage this moment of verve to perform spectacular, deadly maneuvers. This state of flair is called panache, and you are either in a state of panache or you are not.\n\n You gain panache by successfully performing the skill check associated with specific actions that have a bit of flair, including [Tumble Through](/Actions.aspx?ID=29) and additional actions determined by your [swashbuckler's style](/classes/swashbuckler/styles). At the GM's discretion, after succeeding at a check to perform a particularly daring action, such as swinging on a chandelier or sliding down a drapery, you also gain panache if your result is high enough (typically the very hard DC for your level, but the GM can choose a different threshold).\n\n While you have panache, you gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speeds and gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to Tumble Through or to take any actions that give you panache due to your style. The precise strike class feature also causes you to deal extra precision damage while you have panache. Powerful finisher actions, including Confident Finisher can be used only while you have panache and cause you to lose your panache. \n\nNormally, you gain and use panache only in combat encounters; when an encounter ends, you lose panache.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Swashbuckler's Style</title>\r\nAs a swashbuckler, you have your own distinctive style that enables you to gracefully handle everyday events and life-or- death situations alike. Choose a swashbuckler's style. This style determines the additional actions you use to gain panache and makes you trained in the skill related to that action. \n\nA list of all swashbuckler's styles can be found [here](/classes/swashbuckler/styles).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Precise Strike</title>\r\nYou strike with flair. When you have panache and you Strike with an agile or finesse melee weapon or agile or finesse unarmed attack, you deal 2 additional precision damage. If the strike is part of a finisher, the additional damage is 2d6 precision damage instead.\n\n As your swashbuckler level increases, so does your additional damage for precise strike. Increase the amount of additional damage on a Strike and the number of additional dice on a finisher by one at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Confident Finisher</title>\r\nYou gain an elegant finishing attack you can make when you have panache. You gain the Confident Finisher action.\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-550\" />\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Swashbuckler Feats</title>\r\nAt 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a [swashbuckler class feat](/Classes.aspx?ID=15/feats).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Skill Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">General Feats</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Great Fortitude</title>\r\nYour physique is incredibly hardy, granting you increased endurance. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Opportune Riposte</title>\r\nYou turn the tables on foes who fumble, capitalizing immediately on their mistake. You gain the Opportune Riposte reaction.\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-551\" />\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Skill Increases</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.\n\n At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Stylish Tricks</title>\r\nAt 3rd level, 7th level, and 15th level, you gain a skill feat. This feat must be for [Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) or the trained skill from your swashbuckler's style.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Vivacious Speed</title>\r\nWhen you've made an impression, you move even faster than normal, darting about the battlefield with incredible speed. Increase the status bonus to your Speeds when you have panache to a +10-foot status bonus; this bonus increases by 5 feet at 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th levels. When you don't have panache, you still get half this status bonus to your Speed, rounded down to the nearest 5-foot increment.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Ability Boosts</title>\r\nAt 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Ancestry Feats</title>\r\nIn addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Weapon Expertise</title>\r\nYou've dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to expert. You gain access to the critical specialization effects of all weapons for which you have expert proficiency.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 7\">Evasion</title>\r\nYou've learned to move quickly to avoid explosions, a dragon's breath, and worse. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 7\">Weapon Specialization</title>\r\nYou've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master and 4 if you're legendary.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 9\">Exemplary Finisher</title>\r\nYou execute your finishing moves with spectacular flair, adding special effects to your finishers. If a Strike you make as part of a finisher hits a foe, you add one of the following effects to the Strike, depending on your swashbuckler's style. \n\nA list of all swashbuckler's styles can be found [here](/classes/swashbuckler/styles).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 9\">Swashbuckler Expertise</title>\r\nYou perform swashbuckling techniques with exceptional flair, making them harder to resist. Your proficiency rank for your swashbuckler class DC increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Continuous Flair</title>\r\nWhile not equal to the heights of your panache in combat, you have a dramatic flair about you in any situation. Whenever you succeed at a check during exploration that would have granted you panache in combat, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to further checks for actions that would grant you panache in combat. This benefit ends when the exploration changes to a different scene (as determined by the GM) or shifts to an encounter or downtime.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Vigilant Senses</title>\r\nThrough your adventures, you've developed keen awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Improved Evasion</title>\r\nYour ability to elude danger is matchless. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to legendary. When you roll a critical failure on a Reflex save, you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure on a Reflex save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Light Armor Expertise</title>\r\nYou've learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Weapon Mastery</title>\r\nYou fully understand your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple and martial weapons and unarmed attacks increase to master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 15\">Greater Weapon Specialization</title>\r\nYour damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 15\">Keen Flair</title>\r\nYou inflict particularly devastating attacks on even well-defended foes. When you Strike with a weapon or unarmed attack with which you have master proficiency, if you roll a 19 on the die and the roll is a success, you critically succeed instead.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 17\">Resolve</title>\r\nYou've steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 19\">Eternal Confidence</title>\r\nAs a swashbuckler at the peak of your skill, you swell with confidence and bravado in every attack. Your proficiency rank for your swashbuckler class DC increases to master.\n\n When you Strike as part of a finisher or Opportune Riposte, you can give the Strike the failure effect from the Confident Finisher action, including the increase from [Precise Finisher](/Feats.aspx?ID=1536) if you have that feat. You can do so only if the Strike uses a weapon or unarmed attack that you could use for Confident Finisher.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 19\">Light Armor Mastery</title>\r\nYour skill with light armor improves, increasing your ability to dodge blows. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to master.","name":"Swashbuckler","navigation":[{"label":"Details","url":"/classes/swashbuckler"},{"label":"Feats","url":"/classes/swashbuckler/feats"},{"label":"Sample Builds","url":"/classes/swashbuckler/sample-builds"},{"label":"Class Kit","url":"/classes/swashbuckler/class-kit"},{"label":"Styles","url":"/classes/swashbuckler/styles"}],"perception_proficiency":"Expert","pfs":"Standard","rarity":"common","reflex_proficiency":"Expert","release_date":"2020-07-30","resistance":{},"search_markdown":"<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<additional-info>\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Advanced Player's Guide](/Sources.aspx?ID=39) pg. 82 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nTo a swashbuckler, anything worth doing is worth doing with style.

For you, battle is a dance where you move among foes with style and grace. You dart among combatants with flair and land powerful finishing moves with a flick of the wrist and a flash of the blade, all while countering attacks with elegant ripostes that keep enemies off balance. Harassing and thwarting your foes lets you charm fate and cheat death time and again with aplomb and plenty of flair. Key Ability: Dexterity At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Dexterity. Hit Points: 10 plus your Constitution modifier You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. Key Terms You'll see these terms in many swashbuckler abilities. Finisher : Finishers are spectacular finishing moves that use your panache. You can use a finisher only if you have panache, and you lose your panache immediately after performing a finisher. Once you use a finisher, you can't use actions that have the attack trait for the rest of your turn. Some actions with the finisher trait also grant an effect on a failure. Effects added on a failure don't apply on a critical failure. If your finisher action succeeds, you can still choose to apply the failure effect instead. For example, you might do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance. Flourish : Actions with this trait are special techniques that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn. Stance : A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and you remain in that stance for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you use an action with the stance trait, you can't use another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode. Roleplaying the Swashbuckler During Combat Encounters... You show off to gain panache, leveraging your flair to build up to powerful finishing moves. You stay nimble, moving into the best position to perform your maneuvers while dodging enemy blows and responding with swift ripostes. Depending on your swashbuckler's style, you might dance among your foes; slip past their defenses; or beguile, distract, or frighten them. During Social Encounters... You are equally likely to charm or intimidate others—or both. You might be an adept socialite, or you might create distractions for others who do the talking. While Exploring... You keep a careful eye on your surroundings and other people, always prepared to leap into action with bravado and flair. You interact with the environment in bold, sweeping strokes rather than skulking to avoid detection. In Downtime... You might carouse at the tavern, repair and maintain your armaments, or train to learn new techniques. To maintain your impressive reputation, you might build an organization in your name or establish a following of admirers. You Might... Portray yourself as a heroic daredevil or a roguish braggart, knowing you can live up to the image you present. Hold yourself in high esteem, confident in your abilities and your reputation. Practice your skills and maneuvers regularly to ensure you never grow rusty. Others Probably... Admire your theatrics, bravado, and skill with a blade. Find you arrogant unless they know you well enough to appreciate your style. Underestimate how much of a threat you pose until they face the end of your deadly blade.

Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class. Panache You care as much about the way you accomplish something as whether you actually accomplish it in the first place. When you perform an action with particular bravado, you can leverage this moment of verve to perform spectacular, deadly maneuvers. This state of flair is called panache, and you are either in a state of panache or you are not. You gain panache by successfully performing the skill check associated with specific actions that have a bit of flair, including Tumble Through and additional actions determined by your swashbuckler's style. At the GM's discretion, after succeeding at a check to perform a particularly daring action, such as swinging on a chandelier or sliding down a drapery, you also gain panache if your result is high enough (typically the very hard DC for your level, but the GM can choose a different threshold). While you have panache, you gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speeds and gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to Tumble Through or to take any actions that give you panache due to your style. The precise strike class feature also causes you to deal extra precision damage while you have panache. Powerful finisher actions, including Confident Finisher can be used only while you have panache and cause you to lose your panache. Normally, you gain and use panache only in combat encounters; when an encounter ends, you lose panache. Swashbuckler's Style As a swashbuckler, you have your own distinctive style that enables you to gracefully handle everyday events and life-or- death situations alike. Choose a swashbuckler's style. This style determines the additional actions you use to gain panache and makes you trained in the skill related to that action. A list of all swashbuckler's styles can be found here. Precise Strike You strike with flair. When you have panache and you Strike with an agile or finesse melee weapon or agile or finesse unarmed attack, you deal 2 additional precision damage. If the strike is part of a finisher, the additional damage is 2d6 precision damage instead. As your swashbuckler level increases, so does your additional damage for precise strike. Increase the amount of additional damage on a Strike and the number of additional dice on a finisher by one at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels. Confident Finisher You gain an elegant finishing attack you can make when you have panache. You gain the Confident Finisher action. Swashbuckler Feats At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a swashbuckler class feat. Skill Feats At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat.

Skill Increases At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert. At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master. Stylish Tricks At 3rd level, 7th level, and 15th level, you gain a skill feat. This feat must be for Acrobatics or the trained skill from your swashbuckler's style. Vivacious Speed When you've made an impression, you move even faster than normal, darting about the battlefield with incredible speed. Increase the status bonus to your Speeds when you have panache to a +10-foot status bonus; this bonus increases by 5 feet at 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th levels. When you don't have panache, you still get half this status bonus to your Speed, rounded down to the nearest 5-foot increment. Ability Boosts At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.

The nature of the relationship between a witch and their patron can serve as details for character development and storytelling. When playing a witch, work with your GM to determine the nature of your patron and how much of that nature you know, both as a player and a character. There are countless ways to handle a witch's patron; the following are just a few approaches you might take.\n\n For a character who truly doesn't know their patron, you might have your GM choose your patron's theme and which lessons your witch learns, as the patron determines what powers to bestow upon you as their emissary—and these can provide clues to your patron's nature. You could instead give your GM a list of lessons you'd like for your character and let the GM choose between them, representing a negotiation between your witch and the patron. In this case, you might choose your patron's theme to indicate which aspect of the patron relates to your character, or let your GM choose the theme. If you want to be fully in control of your abilities, you can choose the lessons you most prefer and let the GM tailor the identity of your patron accordingly.\n\n Another approach is for you to craft the details of your witch's patron yourself. You can then provide those details to the GM to incorporate into a larger narrative or to provide additional flavor and roleplaying context for your character. Your character might still remain ignorant of that patron's identity, even if you as a player know it. Perhaps your character knows the nature of their patron but is cursed to never reveal it to others. You might have willingly sworn a pact to your patron but fear the repercussions should others learn of that pact. Or perhaps you and your patron are entirely forthcoming about your relationship.\n\n Every witch is different, and no story is wrong so long as it's fun and engaging for everyone involved!\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Key Terms</title>\r\n\r\nYou'll see these key terms in many witch class features.\n\n **[Hex](/Traits.aspx?ID=324)**: A hex is a short-term effect generated on the fly from your patron's magic, requiring your familiar to draw from your patron. As such, you can cast only one spell with the hex trait each turn; attempts to cast a second hex spell on the same turn fail and the spellcasting actions are lost.\n\n**[Metamagic](/Traits.aspx?ID=107)**: Actions with the metamagic trait tweak the properties of your spells. These actions usually come from metamagic feats. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell's effect, not of the metamagic action itself.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Roleplaying the Witch</title>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">During Combat Encounters...</title>\r\nYou cast spells to change the course of battle.

and Background</title>\r\nIn addition to the class features you gain at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Initial Proficiencies</title>\r\nAt 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training, noted at the start of this class.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Patron</title>\r\nYou weren't born with the power to cast spells, nor have you spent years in devotion to tomes, deities, or mystical secrets. Your power comes through a potent being that has chosen you as their vessel to carry forth some agenda in the world. This entity is typically mysterious and distant, revealing little of their identity and motivations, and they grant you spells and other magical powers through a familiar, which serves as a conduit for their power.\n\n A patron might be a deity or demigod, a coven of powerful hags, a fey lord, an archdevil, or a similarly powerful entity, or perhaps multiple such figures working in tandem. As you gain more of your patron's power, you might learn more about who or what they are—certain combinations of themes and lessons suggest particular patrons or agendas—but patrons empower witches for their own secretive reasons, which they rarely reveal in full.\n\n At 1st level, choose your patron's theme, which determines your spellcasting tradition, a skill, a special cantrip you gain, and a spell added to your familiar. The patron themes can be found [here](/classes/witch/patron-themes).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Familiar</title>\r\nYour patron has sent you a familiar, a mystical creature that teaches you and facilitates your spells. This familiar follows the rules [here](/familiar-abilities), though as it's a direct conduit between you and your patron, it's more powerful than other familiars. Your familiar gains an extra familiar ability, and gains another extra ability at 6th, 12th, and 18th levels.\n\n Your familiar is the source and repository of the spells your patron has bestowed upon you, and you must commune with your familiar to prepare your spells each day using your witch spellcasting. Your familiar starts off knowing 10 cantrips, five 1st-level spells, and one additional spell determined by your patron's theme. You choose these spells from the common spells of the tradition determined by your patron or from other spells of that tradition you gain access to.\n\n Each time you gain a level, your patron teaches your familiar two new spells of any level you can cast, chosen from common spells of your tradition or others you gain access to. Feats can also grant your familiar additional spells.\n\n Your familiar can learn new spells independently of your patron. It can learn any spell on your tradition's spell list by physically consuming a [scroll](/Rules.aspx?ID=720) of that spell in a process that takes 1 hour. You can use the [Learn a Spell](/Actions.aspx?ID=25) exploration activity to prepare a special written version of a spell, which your familiar can consume as if it were a scroll. You and your familiar can use the Learn a Spell activity to teach your familiar a spell from another witch's familiar. Both familiars must be present for the entirety of the activity, the spell must be on your spellcasting tradition's spell list, and you must pay the usual cost for that activity, typically in the form of an offering to the other familiar's patron. You can't prepare spells from another witch's familiar.\n\n If your familiar dies, your patron replaces it during your next daily preparations. The new familiar might be a duplicate or reincarnation of your former familiar or a new entity altogether, but it knows the same spells your former familiar knew regardless. Your familiar's death doesn't affect any spells you have already prepared.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Witch Spellcasting</title>\r\nUsing your familiar as a conduit, your patron provides you the power to cast spells. You can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells.\n\n At 1st level, you can prepare up to two 1st-level spells and five cantrips each morning from the spells your familiar knows. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.\n\n As you increase in level as a witch, your number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast from spell slots increase, as shown in Table 2–7: Witch Spells per Day.\n\n Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Heightening Spells</title> When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Cantrips</title>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest level of witch spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level witch, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level witch, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Hexes</title>\r\nYour patron and familiar teach you special spells called hexes. A hex is a short-term effect drawn directly from your patron's magic. As such, you can cast only one hex each turn; attempts to cast a second hex spell on that turn fail and the spellcasting actions are lost.\n\n Hexes are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to commune with your familiar. Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. \n\nFocus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Certain feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points. The full rules for focus spells appear [here](/Rules.aspx?ID=276). \n\nYou learn the [_phase familiar_](/Spells.aspx?ID=804) hex, which you can cast as a reaction to protect your familiar from harm. You learn most other hexes from witch lessons. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Hex Cantrips</title> Hex cantrips are special hexes that don't cost Focus Points, so you can cast them as often as you like, though you can still cast only one hex each round. Hex cantrips are in addition to the cantrips you choose with your witch spellcasting and aren't counted toward your prepared cantrips. Your hex cantrips are determined by your patron theme.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Skill Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Witch Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a [witch class feat](/Classes.aspx?ID=16/feats).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">General Feats</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Skill Increases</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.\n\n At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Ability Boosts</title>\r\nAt 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Ancestry Feats</title>\r\nIn addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Magical Fortitude</title>\r\nYour patron's power boosts your physical resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 7\">Expert Spellcaster</title>\r\nYou've learned to better control the power your patron has granted you. Your proficiency ranks for spell attacks and spell DCs for your witch spellcasting increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 9\">Lightning Reflexes</title>\r\nYour reflexes are lightning fast, helping you avoid danger. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Alertness</title>\r\nYou remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Weapon Expertise</title>\r\nThrough sheer experience, you've improved your technique with your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Defensive Robes</title>\r\nThe flow of magic through your spellcasting and your defensive training combine to help you get out of the way before an attack. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Weapon Specialization</title>\r\nYou can inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master and 4 if you're legendary.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 15\">Master Spellcaster</title>\r\nYou've achieved mastery over your patron's magic. Your proficiency ranks for spell attacks and spell DCs for your witch spellcasting increase to master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 17\">Resolve</title>\r\nCommunion with your familiar has steeled your mental fortitude. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 19\">Legendary Spellcaster</title>\r\nYou've perfected your command of the magic your patron provides. Your proficiency ranks for spell attacks and spell DCs for your witch spellcasting increase to legendary.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 19\">Patron's Gift</title>\r\nYour patron grants you the power to command incredible works of magic. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using witch spellcasting. Unlike with other spell slots, these spell slots can't be used for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell slots or abilities that give you more spell slots. You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, though you can take the [Patron's Truth](/Feats.aspx?ID=1591) feat to gain a second slot.","name":"Witch","navigation":[{"label":"Details","url":"/classes/witch"},{"label":"Feats","url":"/classes/witch/feats"},{"label":"Sample Builds","url":"/classes/witch/sample-builds"},{"label":"Class Kit","url":"/classes/witch/class-kit"},{"label":"Focus Spells","url":"/classes/witch/focus-spells"},{"label":"Lessons","url":"/classes/witch/lessons"},{"label":"Patron Themes","url":"/classes/witch/patron-themes"}],"perception_proficiency":"Trained","pfs":"Standard","rarity":"common","reflex_proficiency":"Trained","release_date":"2020-07-30","resistance":{},"search_markdown":"<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<additional-info>\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Advanced Player's Guide](/Sources.aspx?ID=39) pg. 94 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nThe witch is a versatile spellcaster who learns a variety of magical lessons from a mystical familiar, sent to them by a powerful and mysterious …\r\n</summary>","skill_proficiency":["Trained in one skill determined by your patron","Trained in a number of additional skills equal to 3 plus your Intelligence modifier"],"source":["Advanced Player's Guide"],"source_raw":["Advanced Player's Guide pg. 94"],"source_category":"Rulebooks","source_markdown":"<row gap=\"tiny\">[Advanced Player's Guide](/Sources.aspx?ID=39) pg. 94 <sup>2.0</sup></row>","speed":{},"summary":"The witch is a versatile spellcaster who learns a variety of magical lessons from a mystical familiar, sent to them by a powerful and mysterious …","summary_markdown":"The witch is a versatile spellcaster who learns a variety of magical lessons from a mystical familiar, sent to them by a powerful and mysterious …","text":" Witch Source Advanced Player's Guide pg. 94 2.0 You command powerful magic, not through study or devotion to any ideal, but as a vessel or agent for a mysterious, otherworldly patron that even you don't entirely understand.

In Service to the Unknown A witch's patron is a mysterious entity, rarely known or understood even by the witch in that patron's service. The nature of the relationship between a witch and their patron can serve as details for character development and storytelling.

Perhaps your character knows the nature of their patron but is cursed to never reveal it to others. You might have willingly sworn a pact to your patron but fear the repercussions should others learn of that pact. Or perhaps you and your patron are entirely forthcoming about your relationship. Every witch is different, and no story is wrong so long as it's fun and engaging for everyone involved! Key Terms You'll see these key terms in many witch class features. Hex : A hex is a short-term effect generated on the fly from your patron's magic, requiring your familiar to draw from your patron. As such, you can cast only one spell with the hex trait each turn; attempts to cast a second hex spell on the same turn fail and the spellcasting actions are lost. Metamagic : Actions with the metamagic trait tweak the properties of your spells. These actions usually come from metamagic feats. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell's effect, not of the metamagic action itself. Roleplaying the Witch During Combat Encounters... You cast spells to change the course of battle. You use magical hexes to hamper enemies and aid allies, while leveraging more powerful spells to control the battlefield, heal, or harm, aided by your extraordinary familiar, brewed potions, and magical items. During Social Encounters... You provide knowledge on numerous topics, including a variety of magical matters, and you might call upon your patron's magic to charm or deceive others. While Exploring... You remain alert for magical traps and treasures, employing a clever array of spells to overcome obstacles that stand in your way. Your familiar might aid you through its own considerable set of exceptional abilities. In Downtime... You brew potions, craft other magical items, or hunt for new spells for your familiar to learn. You might try to learn more about your patron, their aims, or your own powers, and you might seek out the company of other witches for collaboration or community. You Might... Strive to learn more about your patron or familiar, your patron's goals, why they chose to empower you, and how you fit into their plans. Seek out new sources of magic, like scrolls and spellbooks, to supplement the spells your patron provides. View your familiar as a steadfast ally, a dear friend, or a necessary nuisance, depending on its personality. Others Probably... Wonder about the nature of your patron and the source of your magic, worrying you'll turn on them or that you unknowingly serve to a foul power. Appreciate your ability to aid them with magic, whether you do so by helping them directly or by hampering their adversaries. Take care not to offend you, fearful that you'll place a malicious hex on them if you're angered.

Ancestry and Background In addition to the class features you gain at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training, noted at the start of this class. Patron You weren't born with the power to cast spells, nor have you spent years in devotion to tomes, deities, or mystical secrets. Your power comes through a potent being that has chosen you as their vessel to carry forth some agenda in the world. This entity is typically mysterious and distant, revealing little of their identity and motivations, and they grant you spells and other magical powers through a familiar, which serves as a conduit for their power. A patron might be a deity or demigod, a coven of powerful hags, a fey lord, an archdevil, or a similarly powerful entity, or perhaps multiple such figures working in tandem. As you gain more of your patron's power, you might learn more about who or what they are—certain combinations of themes and lessons suggest particular patrons or agendas—but patrons empower witches for their own secretive reasons, which they rarely reveal in full. At 1st level, choose your patron's theme, which determines your spellcasting tradition, a skill, a special cantrip you gain, and a spell added to your familiar. The patron themes can be found here. Familiar Your patron has sent you a familiar, a mystical creature that teaches you and facilitates your spells. This familiar follows the rules here, though as it's a direct conduit between you and your patron, it's more powerful than other familiars. Your familiar gains an extra familiar ability, and gains another extra ability at 6th, 12th, and 18th levels. Your familiar is the source and repository of the spells your patron has bestowed upon you, and you must commune with your familiar to prepare your spells each day using your witch spellcasting. Your familiar starts off knowing 10 cantrips, five 1st-level spells, and one additional spell determined by your patron's theme. You choose these spells from the common spells of the tradition determined by your patron or from other spells of that tradition you gain access to. Each time you gain a level, your patron teaches your familiar two new spells of any level you can cast, chosen from common spells of your tradition or others you gain access to. Feats can also grant your familiar additional spells. Your familiar can learn new spells independently of your patron. It can learn any spell on your tradition's spell list by physically consuming a scroll of that spell in a process that takes 1 hour. You can use the Learn a Spell exploration activity to prepare a special written version of a spell, which your familiar can consume as if it were a scroll. You and your familiar can use the Learn a Spell activity to teach your familiar a spell from another witch's familiar. Both familiars must be present for the entirety of the activity, the spell must be on your spellcasting tradition's spell list, and you must pay the usual cost for that activity, typically in the form of an offering to the other familiar's patron. You can't prepare spells from another witch's familiar. If your familiar dies, your patron replaces it during your next daily preparations. The new familiar might be a duplicate or reincarnation of your former familiar or a new entity altogether, but it knows the same spells your former familiar knew regardless. Your familiar's death doesn't affect any spells you have already prepared. Witch Spellcasting Using your familiar as a conduit, your patron provides you the power to cast spells. You can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. At 1st level, you can prepare up to two 1st-level spells and five cantrips each morning from the spells your familiar knows. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots. As you increase in level as a witch, your number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast from spell slots increase, as shown in Table 2–7: Witch Spells per Day. Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier. Heightening Spells When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. Cantrips Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest level of witch spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level witch, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level witch, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells. Hexes Your patron and familiar teach you special spells called hexes. A hex is a short-term effect drawn directly from your patron's magic. As such, you can cast only one hex each turn; attempts to cast a second hex spell on that turn fail and the spellcasting actions are lost. Hexes are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to commune with your familiar. Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Certain feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points. The full rules for focus spells appear here. You learn the phase familiar hex, which you can cast as a reaction to protect your familiar from harm. You learn most other hexes from witch lessons. Hex Cantrips Hex cantrips are special hexes that don't cost Focus Points, so you can cast them as often as you like, though you can still cast only one hex each round. Hex cantrips are in addition to the cantrips you choose with your witch spellcasting and aren't counted toward your prepared cantrips. Your hex cantrips are determined by your patron theme. Skill Feats At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat. Witch Feats At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a witch class feat. General Feats At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. Skill Increases At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert. At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master. Ability Boosts At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18. Ancestry Feats In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. Magical Fortitude Your patron's power boosts your physical resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert. Expert Spellcaster You've learned to better control the power your patron has granted you. Your proficiency ranks for spell attacks and spell DCs for your witch spellcasting increase to expert. Lightning Reflexes Your reflexes are lightning fast, helping you avoid danger. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert. Alertness You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert. Weapon Expertise Through sheer experience, you've improved your technique with your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert. Defensive Robes The flow of magic through your spellcasting and your defensive training combine to help you get out of the way before an attack. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert. Weapon Specialization You can inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master and 4 if you're legendary. Master Spellcaster You've achieved mastery over your patron's magic. Your proficiency ranks for spell attacks and spell DCs for your witch spellcasting increase to master. Resolve Communion with your familiar has steeled your mental fortitude. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead. Legendary Spellcaster You've perfected your command of the magic your patron provides. Your proficiency ranks for spell attacks and spell DCs for your witch spellcasting increase to legendary. Patron's Gift Your patron grants you the power to command incredible works of magic. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using witch spellcasting. Unlike with other spell slots, these spell slots can't be used for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell slots or abilities that give you more spell slots. You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, though you can take the Patron's Truth feat to gain a second slot.","trait_markdown":"","type":"Class","url":"/Classes.aspx?ID=16","weakness":{},"will_proficiency":"Expert"}},{"_index":"aon18","_id":"class-17","_score":6.847722,"_source":{"ability":["Strength","Dexterity"],"attack_proficiency":["Trained in simple weapons","Trained in martial weapons","Trained in unarmed attacks"],"breadcrumbs_spa":[],"category":"class","defense_proficiency":["Trained in light armor","Trained in medium armor","Trained in unarmored defense"],"exclude_from_search":false,"fortitude_proficiency":"Expert","hp":8,"hp_raw":"8","icon_image":"/Images/Class/Magus_Icon.png","id":"class-17","image":["/Images/Classes/Iconic_Seltyiel.png"],"markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Class\" pfs=\"Standard\">[Magus](/Classes.aspx?ID=17)</title>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n<column gap=\"medium\" flex=\"1 1 400px\">\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Secrets of Magic](/Sources.aspx?ID=96) pg. 35 <sup>1.1</sup></row>\n\n_Combining the physicality and technique of a warrior with the ability to cast arcane magic, you seek to perfect the art of fusing spell and strike.

You can enter your Arcane Cascade stance with either Spellstrike or a normally cast spell, so it could be in your best interest to cast a spell to buff yourself at the beginning of a fight and enter Arcane Cascade, rather than going for an early Spellstrike. You can usually stay in Arcane Cascade for a long time, though if you find out an enemy has a weakness to a certain damage type, such as fire, you might want to refresh your stance with a fire spell to take advantage of the bonus damage. It's often worth it to cast your conflux spells and make a Strike either on a turn where you can't make a Spellstrike, or as the last action on your turn after a Spellstrike. Sometimes, it might be worth it to cast a conflux spell even if you think you'll miss, because it can still recharge your Spellstrike for your next turn. Since a lot can ride on your Spellstrike, which uses your multiple attack penalty, it's much better if used as the first attack of the turn!\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Key Terms</title>\r\n\r\nYou'll see the following key term in many magus class features.\n\n **[Stance](/Traits.aspx?ID=152)**: A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and you remain in that stance for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you use an action with the stance trait, you can't use another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Spellstrike Options</title>\r\n\r\nThe following cantrips and 1st-level spells require spell attack rolls and can therefore be used with Spellstrike.

Background</title>\r\nIn addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Initial Proficiencies</title>\r\nAt 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Arcane Spellcasting</title>\r\nYou study spells so you can combine them with your attacks or solve problems that strength of arms alone can't handle. You can cast arcane spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Because you're a magus, you can draw replacement sigils with the tip of your weapon or your free hand for spells requiring material components, replacing them with somatic components instead of needing a [material component pouch](/Equipment.aspx?ID=33).\n\n At 1st level, you can prepare one 1st-level spell and five cantrips each morning from the spells in your spellbook (see below). Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.\n\n As you increase in level as a magus, your number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast from spell slots increase, shown in Table 2–2: Magus Spells per Day. Because you split your focus between physical training and magical scholarship, you have no more than two spell slots of your highest level and, if you can cast 2nd-level spells or higher, two spell slots of 1 level lower than your highest spell level.\n\n Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear in [Spell Attack Roll](/Rules.aspx?ID=325). \n\n<title level=\"3\">Heightening Spells</title> When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they're heightened to certain levels. \n\n<title level=\"3\">Cantrips</title> A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as a magus. For example, as a 1st-level magus, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level magus, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells. \n\n<title level=\"3\">Spellbook</title> Every arcane spell has a written version, usually recorded in a spellbook. You start with a [spellbook](/Equipment.aspx?ID=53) worth 10 sp or less, which you receive for free and must study to prepare your spells each day. The spellbook contains your choice of eight arcane cantrips and four 1st-level arcane spells. You choose these from the common spells on the [arcane](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=1) spell list or from other arcane spells you gain access to. Your spellbook's form and name are up to you. It might be anything from a sturdy book with a secure latch entitled _Theses on the Stratagems of Supernatural Warfare_ to a tattered collection of training pamphlets with your name scrawled on the cover.\n\n Each time you gain a level, you add two more arcane spells to your spellbook, of any level of spell you can cast. You can also use the [Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2) skill to add other spells that you find in your adventures (see  &lt;%SKILLS.GENERAL%4%%&gt; Learn a Spell &lt;%END>). Though you lose some lower spell slots as you increase in level, you keep the spells in your spellbook and can prepare them in your higher-level slots as normal.\n\n If you have a spellbook from multiple sources (such as being a magus with the [Wizard Dedication](/Feats.aspx?ID=742) feat), you can use the same spellbook for all your spells.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Spellstrike</title>\r\nYou've learned the fundamental magus technique that lets you combine magical and physical attacks together. You gain the Spellstrike activity.\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-755\" />\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Arcane Cascade</title>\r\nAfter you wield magic, you can enter a special stance to make your attacks more effective.\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-756\" />\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Hybrid Study</title>\r\nYour extensive physical training and carefully chosen magic combine to form a unique and dangerous fighting style that's more than the sum of its parts. You choose one field of hybrid study to represent your particular combination of skills. Your hybrid study gives you a special ability, usually tied to Spellstrike or Arcane Cascade, and it determines your initial conflux spell. Hybrid Studies can be found [here](/classes/magus/hybrid-studies).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Conflux Spells</title>\r\nYou learn a conflux spell from your hybrid study, and you can cast additional conflux spells by selecting certain feats. Conflux spells are magus-specific spells created for combat and are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to both study your spellbook and perform a physical regimen.\n\n Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Focus spells don't require spell slots, nor can you cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 points. The full rules can be found [here](/Rules.aspx?ID=276).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Magus Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a magus class feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Skill Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat.

You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Ancestry Feats</title>\r\nIn addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Lightning Reflexes</title>\r\nYour reflexes are lightning fast.

You add any spells from this class feature to your spellbook. At 11th level, the extra slots increase to 3rd level and you add [_haste_](/Spells.aspx?ID=147) and an additional spell depending on your hybrid study. At 13th level, the extra slots increase to 4th level and you add [_fly_](/Spells.aspx?ID=125) and an additional spell depending on your hybrid study.\n\nSee specific [hybrid studies](/classes/magus/hybrid-studies) for more information.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 7\">Weapon Specialization</title>\r\nYou can inflict greater injuries with your favored weapons.

While the hefty tome you carry reflects hours conducting arcane research, your enemies need no reminder of your training. They recognize it as you take them down. Key Ability: Strength or Dexterity At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to your choice of Strength or Dexterity. Hit Points: 8 plus your Constitution modifier You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. Combining your Abilities As a magus, you have multiple special actions and abilities that can be used in combination with your spells. You can enter your Arcane Cascade stance with either Spellstrike or a normally cast spell, so it could be in your best interest to cast a spell to buff yourself at the beginning of a fight and enter Arcane Cascade, rather than going for an early Spellstrike. You can usually stay in Arcane Cascade for a long time, though if you find out an enemy has a weakness to a certain damage type, such as fire, you might want to refresh your stance with a fire spell to take advantage of the bonus damage. It's often worth it to cast your conflux spells and make a Strike either on a turn where you can't make a Spellstrike, or as the last action on your turn after a Spellstrike. Sometimes, it might be worth it to cast a conflux spell even if you think you'll miss, because it can still recharge your Spellstrike for your next turn. Since a lot can ride on your Spellstrike, which uses your multiple attack penalty, it's much better if used as the first attack of the turn! Key Terms You'll see the following key term in many magus class features. Stance : A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and you remain in that stance for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you use an action with the stance trait, you can't use another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode. Spellstrike Options The following cantrips and 1st-level spells require spell attack rolls and can therefore be used with Spellstrike. This list can get you started picking your spells. Cantrips : acid splash , gouging claw , produce flame , ray of frost , tanglefoot , telekinetic projectile 1st-Level Spells : horizon thunder sphere , hydraulic push , ray of enfeeblement , shocking grasp , snowball Roleplaying the Magus During Combat Encounters... You channel spells through your weapon or body to hit enemies with a powerful attack and spell combination. Because your spells per day are limited, you often rely on trusty, carefully chosen cantrips and focus spells. When necessary, you know how to win a fight without magic. During Social Encounters... Your education and breadth of experience make you knowledgeable about many subjects. You can contribute information related to your scholarly pursuits, especially about magic. While Exploring... Your flexibility means you might look for magical auras, remain on guard, or even sneak around. Your ability to fill different niches means that your role often depends on the talents of the other members of your group. In Downtime... You split your time between magical pursuits, like researching spells and crafting items, and martial practice, such as retraining combat abilities to learn new techniques. You Might... Continually refine your spell and item selections to suit your personal style, or prepare battle plans and spell lists for a variety of situations. Socialize with scholars of magic and veteran combatants alike, seeking out masters to teach you new techniques. Overreach with ambitious plans that pull you in too many directions at once. Others Probably... Wonder how you can keep on top of two disparate disciplines at the same time. Believe you have a broad enough skill set to take care of yourself in most situations.

Ancestry And Background In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class. Arcane Spellcasting You study spells so you can combine them with your attacks or solve problems that strength of arms alone can't handle. You can cast arcane spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Because you're a magus, you can draw replacement sigils with the tip of your weapon or your free hand for spells requiring material components, replacing them with somatic components instead of needing a material component pouch. At 1st level, you can prepare one 1st-level spell and five cantrips each morning from the spells in your spellbook (see below). Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots. As you increase in level as a magus, your number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast from spell slots increase, shown in Table 2–2: Magus Spells per Day. Because you split your focus between physical training and magical scholarship, you have no more than two spell slots of your highest level and, if you can cast 2nd-level spells or higher, two spell slots of 1 level lower than your highest spell level. Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear in Spell Attack Roll. Heightening Spells When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they're heightened to certain levels. Cantrips A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as a magus. For example, as a 1st-level magus, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level magus, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells. Spellbook Every arcane spell has a written version, usually recorded in a spellbook. You start with a spellbook worth 10 sp or less, which you receive for free and must study to prepare your spells each day. The spellbook contains your choice of eight arcane cantrips and four 1st-level arcane spells. You choose these from the common spells on the arcane spell list or from other arcane spells you gain access to. Your spellbook's form and name are up to you. It might be anything from a sturdy book with a secure latch entitled Theses on the Stratagems of Supernatural Warfare to a tattered collection of training pamphlets with your name scrawled on the cover. Each time you gain a level, you add two more arcane spells to your spellbook, of any level of spell you can cast. You can also use the Arcana skill to add other spells that you find in your adventures (see &lt;%SKILLS.GENERAL%4%%&gt; Learn a Spell &lt;%END>). Though you lose some lower spell slots as you increase in level, you keep the spells in your spellbook and can prepare them in your higher-level slots as normal. If you have a spellbook from multiple sources (such as being a magus with the Wizard Dedication feat), you can use the same spellbook for all your spells. Spellstrike You've learned the fundamental magus technique that lets you combine magical and physical attacks together. You gain the Spellstrike activity. Arcane Cascade After you wield magic, you can enter a special stance to make your attacks more effective. Hybrid Study Your extensive physical training and carefully chosen magic combine to form a unique and dangerous fighting style that's more than the sum of its parts. You choose one field of hybrid study to represent your particular combination of skills. Your hybrid study gives you a special ability, usually tied to Spellstrike or Arcane Cascade, and it determines your initial conflux spell. Hybrid Studies can be found here. Conflux Spells You learn a conflux spell from your hybrid study, and you can cast additional conflux spells by selecting certain feats. Conflux spells are magus-specific spells created for combat and are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to both study your spellbook and perform a physical regimen. Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Focus spells don't require spell slots, nor can you cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 points. The full rules can be found here. Magus Feats At 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a magus class feat. Skill Feats At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat. General Feats At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. Skill Increases At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this skill increase to become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or become an expert in one skill in which you are already trained. At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master. Ability Boosts At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18. Ancestry Feats In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. Lightning Reflexes Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert. Weapon Expertise You've dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to expert. Studious Spells Your hybrid study grants you additional spells that can enhance your power in combat. You gain two special 2nd-level studious spell slots, which can be used to prepare spider climb , true strike , water breathing , and an additional spell depending on your hybrid study. You add any spells from this class feature to your spellbook. At 11th level, the extra slots increase to 3rd level and you add haste and an additional spell depending on your hybrid study. At 13th level, the extra slots increase to 4th level and you add fly and an additional spell depending on your hybrid study. See specific hybrid studies for more information. Weapon Specialization You can inflict greater injuries with your favored weapons. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary. Alertness You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert. Expert Spellcaster Your fundamental understanding of magic improves, making your spells harder to resist. Your proficiency ranks for arcane spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.

Juggernaut Your body is accustomed to physical hardship and resistant to a wide range of ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead. Master Spellcaster You fortify your spells with masterful prowess. Your proficiency ranks for arcane spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master. Medium Armor Mastery Your skill with light and medium armor improves, increasing your ability to avoid blows. Your proficiency ranks for light and medium armor, as well as for unarmed defense, increase to master. Double Spellstrike You can extend the magic of spells you store with Spellstrike. After you make a Spellstrike with a spell cast from a spell slot, you retain an echo of the spell, stored in your body. The next time you Spellstrike, you can cast the same spell again without expending a spell slot. If you choose to cast a different spell with Spellstrike, or you go 1 minute without using the stored spell, the stored spell dissipates harmlessly.","trait_markdown":"","type":"Class","url":"/Classes.aspx?ID=17","weakness":{},"will_proficiency":"Expert"}},{"_index":"aon18","_id":"class-18","_score":6.847722,"_source":{"ability":["Charisma"],"attack_proficiency":["Trained in simple weapons","Trained in unarmed attacks"],"breadcrumbs_spa":[],"category":"class","defense_proficiency":["Trained in unarmored defense"],"exclude_from_search":false,"fortitude_proficiency":"Expert","hp":10,"hp_raw":"10","icon_image":"/Images/Class/Summoner_Icon.png","id":"class-18","image":["/Images/Classes/Iconic_Ija.png"],"markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Class\" pfs=\"Standard\">[Summoner](/Classes.aspx?ID=18)</title>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n<column gap=\"medium\" flex=\"1 1 400px\">\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Secrets of Magic](/Sources.aspx?ID=96) pg. 51 <sup>1.1</sup></row>\n\n_You can magically beckon a powerful being called an eidolon to your side, serving as the mortal conduit that anchors it to the world.

level=\"3\" >Ancestry And Background</title>\r\nIn addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Initial Proficiencies</title>\r\nAt 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Eidolon</title>\r\nYou have a connection with a powerful and usually otherworldly entity called an eidolon, and you can use your life force as a conduit to manifest this ephemeral entity into the mortal world. Magic also flows through this conduit from your eidolon into you, so your eidolon determines the type of spells you cast and the spell list you choose from (as described in Summoner Spellcasting below). Choose a type of eidolon from the options starting on page 59 and other eidolons you have access to. When you choose your eidolon, you also determine its appearance and general form, within the parameters for that particular type of eidolon. Once you establish your eidolon's type and general appearance, these features can't be changed later, except by selecting special evolution feats that can cause your eidolon to develop new features. Your magical connection with your eidolon takes the form of a sigil on each of your bodies. As long as your eidolon is manifested, the sigil glows with light and can't be covered or disguised via any means; it will shine through clothing, appear over cloaks, and remain unaffected by obfuscating magic. This, combined with the way that the two of you clearly act in tandem, makes it readily apparent to an intelligent observer that the two of you are connected in some way, even if the person has never encountered a summoner before. You bring your eidolon into reality with the Manifest Eidolon action.\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-757\" /> Your eidolon is no mere minion. It doesn't have the [minion](/Traits.aspx?ID=109) or [summoned](/Traits.aspx?ID=154) trait, and the two of you work together and coordinate your actions. You and your eidolon share your actions and multiple attack penalty. Each round, you can use any of your actions (including reactions and free actions) for yourself or your eidolon.\n\n You coordinate your actions with your eidolon more efficiently when you Act Together.\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-758\" />Your connection with your eidolon allows you to communicate with it telepathically at all times, even when it isn't manifested. You also gain the Share Senses action.\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-759\" />Lastly, the connection between you and your eidolon means you both share a single pool of Hit Points. Damage taken by either you or the eidolon reduces your Hit Points, while healing either of you recovers your Hit Points. Like with your actions, if you and your eidolon are both subject to the same effect that affects your Hit Points, you apply those effects only once (applying the greater effect, if applicable). For instance, if you and your eidolon get caught in an area effect that would heal or damage you both, only the greater amount of healing or damage applies. \n\n<title level=\"3\">Gear And Your Eidolon</title> Your eidolon can't wear or use magic items, except for items with the [eidolon](/Traits.aspx?ID=386) trait. An eidolon can have up to two items invested. Your eidolon's link to you means it can benefit from certain magic items invested by you. \n<ul><li>Your eidolon gains item bonuses to Perception and skills from any magical items that you have invested.</li><li>Your eidolon increases its item bonus to AC based on your armor's [_armor potency rune_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=278) or [_bracers of armor_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=416). It also gains an item bonus to its saves from the [resilient rune](/Equipment.aspx?ID=279) on your armor or from your _bracers of armor_. Other permanent items that grant or increase item bonuses to AC and saves might convey a similar benefit, as determined by the GM.</li><li>Your eidolon's Strikes benefit from the fundamental and property runes on your [handwraps of mighty blows](/Equipment.aspx?ID=441). Alternatively, you can [Invest](/Actions.aspx?ID=289) a magic weapon (even though magic weapons can't normally be Invested) to share its fundamental and property runes with your eidolon. You share these benefits only while you're holding the weapon, and you can have no more than one weapon invested in this way at a time. In either case, the eidolon gains only the benefits that can apply to its attacks, with the same limitations noted in _handwraps of mighty blows_.</li></ul> \n\n<title level=\"3\">Lost And Altered Actions</title> If you or your eidolon becomes [slowed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=35), [stunned](/Conditions.aspx?ID=36), [quickened](/Conditions.aspx?ID=32), or otherwise affected by something that changes the actions you gain at the start of each turn, it affects your shared actions. However, if you are both subject to such an effect, apply only the more severe one. For instance, if you or your eidolon were slowed 1, you would start your turn with one fewer action, but if you were both slowed 1, you would still lose only one action, rather than adding the two slowed effects together. However, if you were slowed 1 and your eidolon slowed 2, you'd have two fewer actions, because that's the more severe effect. If only one of you becomes restricted in how you can spend your actions, that restriction doesn't automatically extend to the other; for example, if your eidolon became [immobilized](/Conditions.aspx?ID=24) or [petrified](/Conditions.aspx?ID=30), it wouldn't be able to move, but you could still use your actions to move. The GM resolves any situation that's unclear.\n\n You, as the player, control both your summoner and your eidolon, and the two are generally considered to cooperate unless you decide for them not to. While a summoner's link with an eidolon is a partnership, ultimately the eidolon is linked to you, not the other way around. If there's ever a conflict of who should act, you win out over your eidolon. This means that if the eidolon comes under an effect that would take its actions out of your control, such as the [confused](/Conditions.aspx?ID=5) or [controlled](/Conditions.aspx?ID=6) condition, you can use all of your shared actions so your eidolon doesn't have any actions remaining to cause trouble (as long as you are able to act). However, if you came under such an effect, you would simply use all of your shared actions, preventing your eidolon from acting.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Summoner Spellcasting</title>\r\nYour link to your eidolon grants you limited magic connected to your eidolon's nature. You can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Because of the magic you draw from your eidolon, you can usually replace material components with somatic components, so you don't need a [material component pouch](/Equipment.aspx?ID=33).\n\n Each day, you can cast one 1st-level spell and five cantrips. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.\n\n As you increase in level as a summoner, the magical link with your eidolon grants you additional, more powerful spell slots. Your total number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast are shown in Table 2–4: Summoner Spells per Day. Because of the way you draw magic from your connection to your eidolon, you begin to lose lower-level spell slots once you reach 5th level. The maximum number of spell slots you get from the summoner class is four, starting when you reach 4th level.\n\n Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear in [Spell Attack Roll](/Rules.aspx?ID=325). \n\n<title level=\"3\">Heightening Spells</title> When you gain spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. \n\n<title level=\"3\">Cantrips</title> A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as a summoner. For example, as a 1st-level summoner, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level summoner, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Spell Repertoire</title>\r\nThe collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-level spells of your choice and five cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the tradition corresponding to your eidolon, or from other spells from that tradition to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level. Your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it doesn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.\n\n You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2–4: Summoner Spells per Day), you add a spell of the same level to your spell repertoire. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-level spell. At 3rd level, you add the first 2nd-level spell to your repertoire. At 4th level you gain your second and your spell repertoire reaches its maximum size of five spells.\n\n At 5th level, in addition to adding two 3rd-level spells to your repertoire, you lose your lowest level of spell slots. Any time you lose a level of spell slots, you lose two spells in your repertoire as well. These can come from spells you already know or out of the number of new spells you're learning. On levels in which you don't change your spell slots, you can swap out multiple spells, as described below. \n\n<title level=\"3\">Swapping Spells In Your Repertoire</title> As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. If it's a level at which you lose a set of lower-level slots, you can replace the two in either order. You can also instead swap a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime. \n\nAt 6th level and every even level thereafter, you can swap out any number of your spells for different spells of a level you can cast. When you do, you must keep at least one spell you can cast with your lowest level of spell slots so you don't end up with slots you can't use. For instance, at 6th level you would need to keep at least one 2nd-level spell, but all your other spells could be 3rd level.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Link Spells</title>\r\nYour connection to your eidolon allows you to cast link spells, special spells that have been forged through your shared connection with your eidolon. Link spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to specifically connect with your eidolon, such as by having a heart-to-heart conversation, playing together, or meditating in unison on the nature of your bond.\n\n Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points. The full rules for focus spells appear [here](/Rules.aspx?ID=276).\n\n You learn the [_evolution surge_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1047) link spell, which allows you to grant your eidolon one of several useful benefits. \n\n<title level=\"3\">Link Cantrips</title> Link cantrips are special link spells that don't cost Focus Points, so you can cast them as often as you like. Link cantrips are in addition to the cantrips you choose from your tradition's spell list. Generally, only feats can give you more link cantrips. Unlike other cantrips, you can't swap out link cantrips gained from summoner feats at a later level, unless you swap out the specific feat via [retraining](/Rules.aspx?ID=475). \n\nYou learn the [_boost eidolon_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1045) link cantrip, which briefly improves your eidolon's capabilities, allowing it to attack with greater power.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Evolution Feat</title>\r\nEvolution feats are a special type of summoner class feat that allow you to customize your eidolon through your shared link. You gain an [evolution feat](/feats?include-traits=Evolution&amp;sort=level-asc%3Bname-asc) for your eidolon at 1st level, representing the differences that make it unique from other eidolons of its type. If you retrain this feat, the feat you replace it with must also be an evolution feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Skill Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Summoner Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a summoner class feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">General Feats</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Shared Vigilance</title>\r\nYou and your eidolon work together to remain alert to threats around you, allowing you to perceive far more together than you could individually. Your proficiency rank in Perception and your eidolon's proficiency rank in Perception increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Skill Increases</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained.\n\n At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use skill increases to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Unlimited Signature Spells</title>\r\nAll of your spells are signature spells. That means that if you know a spell, you can heighten it freely by casting it from a higher-level spell slot, up to the maximum level of spell you can cast. You can similarly cast any of its lower-level versions without learning them separately.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Ability Boosts</title>\r\nAt 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if the ability score is already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.\n\n Your eidolon also gets four ability boosts at these levels. The eidolon's ability boosts follow the same rules as yours.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Ancestry Feats</title>\r\nIn addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Eidolon Unarmed Expertise</title>\r\nYour eidolon becomes more capable of using its unarmed attacks. Its proficiency rank for unarmed attacks increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 7\">Eidolon Symbiosis</title>\r\nYour connection with your eidolon strengthens, granting your eidolon access to a new ability depending on its type, as described in Eidolon Abilities in each eidolon's entry.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 7\">Eidolon Weapon Specialization</title>\r\nYour eidolon has learned how to inflict greater injuries with its unarmed attacks. It deals 2 additional damage with unarmed attacks in which it's an expert. This damage increases to 3 if it's a master, and 4 if it's legendary.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 9\">Expert Spellcaster</title>\r\nAs your connection to your eidolon deepens, the power of your spells increases. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for spells of your eidolon's tradition increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 9\">Shared Reflexes</title>\r\nYou and your eidolon boost each other's reflexes, allowing you both to roll away from danger. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves and your eidolon's proficiency rank for Reflex saves increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Eidolon Defensive Expertise</title>\r\nYour eidolon increases its ability to avoid attacks. Its proficiency rank for unarmored defense increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Simple Weapon Expertise</title>\r\nTraining and magic improved your weapon technique. Your proficiency rank for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Twin Juggernauts</title>\r\nYou and your eidolon fight off physical hardship together with your shared life force. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves and your eidolon's proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increase to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead. When your eidolon rolls a success on a Fortitude save, it gets a critical success instead.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Defensive Robes</title>\r\nThe flow of magic around you increases your ability to avoid attacks. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Eidolon Unarmed Mastery</title>\r\nYour eidolon truly masters its unarmed attacks, reaching greater heights. Its proficiency rank for unarmed attacks increases to master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Weapon Specialization</title>\r\nYou've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 15\">Greater Eidolon Specialization</title>\r\nYour eidolon's damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with unarmed attacks in which it's an expert, 6 if it's a master, and 8 if it's legendary.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 15\">Shared Resolve</title>\r\nYou and your eidolon steel your mind together against effects that threaten you, each protecting the others' minds from danger. Your and your eidolon's proficiency ranks for Will saves increase to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead. When your eidolon rolls a success on a Will save, it gets a critical success instead.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 17\">Eidolon Transcendence</title>\r\nYour connection with your eidolon approaches its peak, granting your eidolon access to a powerful new ability depending on its type, as described in Eidolon Abilities in each eidolon's entry. This ability also increases one of the eidolon's ability scores by 2.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 17\">Master Spellcaster</title>\r\nYour connection to your eidolon is strong enough to grant you mastery over associated spells. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for spells of your eidolon's tradition increase to master. \r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 19\">Eidolon Defensive Mastery</title>\r\nYour eidolon's form becomes particularly difficult to assail. Its proficiency rank for unarmored defense increases to master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 19\">Instant Manifestation</title>\r\nYou can manifest your eidolon with incredible speed.

Whether your eidolon is a friend, a servant, or even a personal god, your connection to it marks you as extraordinary, shaping the course of your life dramatically Key Ability: Charisma At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Charisma. Hit Points: 10 plus your Constitution modifier You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. Key Terms The following key terms can be found in many summoner class features. Eidolon : A creature with this trait is an eidolon. An action or spell with this trait can be performed by an eidolon only. An item with this trait can be used or worn by an eidolon only, and an eidolon can't use items that don't have this trait. (An eidolon can have up to two items invested.) Evolution : Feats with this trait affect your eidolon instead of you, typically by granting it additional physical capabilities. Tandem : Actions with this trait involve you and your eidolon acting in concert. You can't use a tandem action if either you or your eidolon can't act, if you haven't Manifested your Eidolon, or if you've Manifested your Eidolon in a way where it isn't a separate entity (such as with the Meld into Eidolon feat). Tandem actions often let both you and your eidolon take separate actions, but these must be actions taken separately by you and your eidolon; you can't use a tandem action to take another tandem action. Summoning Spells When the Master Summoner, Ostentatious Arrival, and Legendary Summoner feats refer to summoning spells, they mean spells that conjure a creature with the summoned trait. The spells that qualify from the Core Rulebook and this book are summon anarch , summon animal , summon axiom , summon elemental , summon entity , summon fey , summon fiend , summon lesser servitor , and summon plant or fungus . Your GM might add other spells from future books that work like these spells. Roleplaying the Summoner During Combat Encounters... You and your eidolon fight together as one. You can rely on your eidolon for mundane challenges, saving your spells for when they're needed most. During Social Encounters... Your powerful personality allows you to take the lead when negotiating. You and your eidolon might engage with others in different ways, but even if your guardian remains silent, its presence reminds those around you of your power. While Exploring... Whether you remain on alert for the presence of strange magic or keep an eye out for trouble, you and your eidolon act together to cover more ground, pool your knowledge, and leverage each other's abilities. In Downtime... You might attempt to learn more about the nature of your eidolon and delve deeper into the secrets of its magical tradition to Learn a Spell, Craft magic items with your eidolon's help, or make allies using your social skills. You Might... Rely on your eidolon to accomplish physical tasks while you handle the mental ones. Develop attitudes and mannerisms in line with your eidolon's way of thinking, even as your nature shapes its behavior. Consider your eidolon a close friend, a guiding figure, a protector, or a rival bound to you. Others Probably... Feel safe with you (and your eidolon) at their side. Expect that since you know information about your eidolon, you might know details about other sorts of strange monsters. View you with awe or fear because of the powerful, strange creature that accompanies you. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics.

Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class. Eidolon You have a connection with a powerful and usually otherworldly entity called an eidolon, and you can use your life force as a conduit to manifest this ephemeral entity into the mortal world. Magic also flows through this conduit from your eidolon into you, so your eidolon determines the type of spells you cast and the spell list you choose from (as described in Summoner Spellcasting below). Choose a type of eidolon from the options starting on page 59 and other eidolons you have access to. When you choose your eidolon, you also determine its appearance and general form, within the parameters for that particular type of eidolon. Once you establish your eidolon's type and general appearance, these features can't be changed later, except by selecting special evolution feats that can cause your eidolon to develop new features. Your magical connection with your eidolon takes the form of a sigil on each of your bodies. As long as your eidolon is manifested, the sigil glows with light and can't be covered or disguised via any means; it will shine through clothing, appear over cloaks, and remain unaffected by obfuscating magic. This, combined with the way that the two of you clearly act in tandem, makes it readily apparent to an intelligent observer that the two of you are connected in some way, even if the person has never encountered a summoner before. You bring your eidolon into reality with the Manifest Eidolon action. Your eidolon is no mere minion. It doesn't have the minion or summoned trait, and the two of you work together and coordinate your actions. You and your eidolon share your actions and multiple attack penalty. Each round, you can use any of your actions (including reactions and free actions) for yourself or your eidolon. You coordinate your actions with your eidolon more efficiently when you Act Together. Your connection with your eidolon allows you to communicate with it telepathically at all times, even when it isn't manifested. You also gain the Share Senses action. Lastly, the connection between you and your eidolon means you both share a single pool of Hit Points. Damage taken by either you or the eidolon reduces your Hit Points, while healing either of you recovers your Hit Points. Like with your actions, if you and your eidolon are both subject to the same effect that affects your Hit Points, you apply those effects only once (applying the greater effect, if applicable). For instance, if you and your eidolon get caught in an area effect that would heal or damage you both, only the greater amount of healing or damage applies. Gear And Your Eidolon Your eidolon can't wear or use magic items, except for items with the eidolon trait. An eidolon can have up to two items invested. Your eidolon's link to you means it can benefit from certain magic items invested by you. Your eidolon gains item bonuses to Perception and skills from any magical items that you have invested. Your eidolon increases its item bonus to AC based on your armor's armor potency rune or bracers of armor . It also gains an item bonus to its saves from the resilient rune on your armor or from your bracers of armor . Other permanent items that grant or increase item bonuses to AC and saves might convey a similar benefit, as determined by the GM. Your eidolon's Strikes benefit from the fundamental and property runes on your handwraps of mighty blows. Alternatively, you can Invest a magic weapon (even though magic weapons can't normally be Invested) to share its fundamental and property runes with your eidolon. You share these benefits only while you're holding the weapon, and you can have no more than one weapon invested in this way at a time. In either case, the eidolon gains only the benefits that can apply to its attacks, with the same limitations noted in handwraps of mighty blows . Lost And Altered Actions If you or your eidolon becomes slowed, stunned, quickened, or otherwise affected by something that changes the actions you gain at the start of each turn, it affects your shared actions. However, if you are both subject to such an effect, apply only the more severe one. For instance, if you or your eidolon were slowed 1, you would start your turn with one fewer action, but if you were both slowed 1, you would still lose only one action, rather than adding the two slowed effects together. However, if you were slowed 1 and your eidolon slowed 2, you'd have two fewer actions, because that's the more severe effect. If only one of you becomes restricted in how you can spend your actions, that restriction doesn't automatically extend to the other; for example, if your eidolon became immobilized or petrified, it wouldn't be able to move, but you could still use your actions to move. The GM resolves any situation that's unclear. You, as the player, control both your summoner and your eidolon, and the two are generally considered to cooperate unless you decide for them not to. While a summoner's link with an eidolon is a partnership, ultimately the eidolon is linked to you, not the other way around. If there's ever a conflict of who should act, you win out over your eidolon. This means that if the eidolon comes under an effect that would take its actions out of your control, such as the confused or controlled condition, you can use all of your shared actions so your eidolon doesn't have any actions remaining to cause trouble (as long as you are able to act). However, if you came under such an effect, you would simply use all of your shared actions, preventing your eidolon from acting. Summoner Spellcasting Your link to your eidolon grants you limited magic connected to your eidolon's nature. You can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Because of the magic you draw from your eidolon, you can usually replace material components with somatic components, so you don't need a material component pouch. Each day, you can cast one 1st-level spell and five cantrips. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots. As you increase in level as a summoner, the magical link with your eidolon grants you additional, more powerful spell slots. Your total number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast are shown in Table 2–4: Summoner Spells per Day. Because of the way you draw magic from your connection to your eidolon, you begin to lose lower-level spell slots once you reach 5th level. The maximum number of spell slots you get from the summoner class is four, starting when you reach 4th level. Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear in Spell Attack Roll. Heightening Spells When you gain spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. Cantrips A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as a summoner. For example, as a 1st-level summoner, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level summoner, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells. Spell Repertoire The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-level spells of your choice and five cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the tradition corresponding to your eidolon, or from other spells from that tradition to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level. Your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it doesn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa. You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2–4: Summoner Spells per Day), you add a spell of the same level to your spell repertoire. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-level spell. At 3rd level, you add the first 2nd-level spell to your repertoire. At 4th level you gain your second and your spell repertoire reaches its maximum size of five spells. At 5th level, in addition to adding two 3rd-level spells to your repertoire, you lose your lowest level of spell slots. Any time you lose a level of spell slots, you lose two spells in your repertoire as well. These can come from spells you already know or out of the number of new spells you're learning. On levels in which you don't change your spell slots, you can swap out multiple spells, as described below. Swapping Spells In Your Repertoire As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. If it's a level at which you lose a set of lower-level slots, you can replace the two in either order. You can also instead swap a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime. At 6th level and every even level thereafter, you can swap out any number of your spells for different spells of a level you can cast. When you do, you must keep at least one spell you can cast with your lowest level of spell slots so you don't end up with slots you can't use. For instance, at 6th level you would need to keep at least one 2nd-level spell, but all your other spells could be 3rd level. Link Spells Your connection to your eidolon allows you to cast link spells, special spells that have been forged through your shared connection with your eidolon. Link spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to specifically connect with your eidolon, such as by having a heart-to-heart conversation, playing together, or meditating in unison on the nature of your bond. Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points. The full rules for focus spells appear here. You learn the evolution surge link spell, which allows you to grant your eidolon one of several useful benefits. Link Cantrips Link cantrips are special link spells that don't cost Focus Points, so you can cast them as often as you like. Link cantrips are in addition to the cantrips you choose from your tradition's spell list. Generally, only feats can give you more link cantrips. Unlike other cantrips, you can't swap out link cantrips gained from summoner feats at a later level, unless you swap out the specific feat via retraining. You learn the boost eidolon link cantrip, which briefly improves your eidolon's capabilities, allowing it to attack with greater power. Evolution Feat Evolution feats are a special type of summoner class feat that allow you to customize your eidolon through your shared link. You gain an evolution feat for your eidolon at 1st level, representing the differences that make it unique from other eidolons of its type. If you retrain this feat, the feat you replace it with must also be an evolution feat. Skill Feats At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat. Summoner Feats At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a summoner class feat. General Feats At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. Shared Vigilance You and your eidolon work together to remain alert to threats around you, allowing you to perceive far more together than you could individually. Your proficiency rank in Perception and your eidolon's proficiency rank in Perception increase to expert. Skill Increases At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained. At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use skill increases to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master. Unlimited Signature Spells All of your spells are signature spells. That means that if you know a spell, you can heighten it freely by casting it from a higher-level spell slot, up to the maximum level of spell you can cast. You can similarly cast any of its lower-level versions without learning them separately. Ability Boosts At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if the ability score is already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18. Your eidolon also gets four ability boosts at these levels. The eidolon's ability boosts follow the same rules as yours. Ancestry Feats In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. Eidolon Unarmed Expertise Your eidolon becomes more capable of using its unarmed attacks. Its proficiency rank for unarmed attacks increases to expert. Eidolon Symbiosis Your connection with your eidolon strengthens, granting your eidolon access to a new ability depending on its type, as described in Eidolon Abilities in each eidolon's entry. Eidolon Weapon Specialization Your eidolon has learned how to inflict greater injuries with its unarmed attacks. It deals 2 additional damage with unarmed attacks in which it's an expert. This damage increases to 3 if it's a master, and 4 if it's legendary. Expert Spellcaster As your connection to your eidolon deepens, the power of your spells increases. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for spells of your eidolon's tradition increase to expert. Shared Reflexes You and your eidolon boost each other's reflexes, allowing you both to roll away from danger. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves and your eidolon's proficiency rank for Reflex saves increase to expert. Eidolon Defensive Expertise Your eidolon increases its ability to avoid attacks. Its proficiency rank for unarmored defense increases to expert. Simple Weapon Expertise Training and magic improved your weapon technique. Your proficiency rank for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increases to expert. Twin Juggernauts You and your eidolon fight off physical hardship together with your shared life force. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves and your eidolon's proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increase to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead. When your eidolon rolls a success on a Fortitude save, it gets a critical success instead. Defensive Robes The flow of magic around you increases your ability to avoid attacks. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert. Eidolon Unarmed Mastery Your eidolon truly masters its unarmed attacks, reaching greater heights. Its proficiency rank for unarmed attacks increases to master. Weapon Specialization You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary. Greater Eidolon Specialization Your eidolon's damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with unarmed attacks in which it's an expert, 6 if it's a master, and 8 if it's legendary. Shared Resolve You and your eidolon steel your mind together against effects that threaten you, each protecting the others' minds from danger. Your and your eidolon's proficiency ranks for Will saves increase to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead. When your eidolon rolls a success on a Will save, it gets a critical success instead. Eidolon Transcendence Your connection with your eidolon approaches its peak, granting your eidolon access to a powerful new ability depending on its type, as described in Eidolon Abilities in each eidolon's entry. This ability also increases one of the eidolon's ability scores by 2. Master Spellcaster Your connection to your eidolon is strong enough to grant you mastery over associated spells. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for spells of your eidolon's tradition increase to master. Eidolon Defensive Mastery Your eidolon's form becomes particularly difficult to assail. Its proficiency rank for unarmored defense increases to master. Instant Manifestation You can manifest your eidolon with incredible speed. You can use Manifest Eidolon as a single action, instead of a three-action activity","trait_markdown":"","type":"Class","url":"/Classes.aspx?ID=18","weakness":{},"will_proficiency":"Expert"}},{"_index":"aon18","_id":"class-19","_score":6.847722,"_source":{"ability":["Intelligence"],"attack_proficiency":["Trained in simple weapons","Trained in martial weapons","Trained in unarmed attacks"],"breadcrumbs_spa":[],"category":"class","defense_proficiency":["Trained in light armor","Trained in medium armor","Trained in unarmored defense"],"exclude_from_search":false,"fortitude_proficiency":"Expert","hp":8,"hp_raw":"8","icon_image":"/Images/Class/Inventor_Icon.png","id":"class-19","image":["/Images/Classes/Iconic_Droven.png"],"markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Class\" pfs=\"Standard\">[Inventor](/Classes.aspx?ID=19)</title>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n<column gap=\"medium\" flex=\"1 1 400px\">\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Guns &amp; Gears](/Sources.aspx?ID=98) pg. 15</row>\r\n\r\n_[**PFS Note**](/pathfinder-society) All Pathfinder Society agents have access to the Inventor class._\r\n\r\n_Any tinkerer can follow a diagram to make a device, but you invent the impossible!

On a failure, the innovation malfunctions in a spectacular (though harmless) fashion, such as a belch of smoke or shower of sparks, and it becomes incapable of being used for further unstable actions.

Choose one innovation. Your innovation's level is equal to your level. If your innovation is destroyed, you can spend 1 day of downtime and attempt a [Crafting](/Skills.aspx?ID=4) check with a [high DC for your level](/Rules.aspx?ID=554); on a success, you rebuild it. An innovation only works due to your constant maintenance and tinkering, and therefore has no market Price. \n\nInnovations can be found [here](/classes/inventor/innovations).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Explode</title>\r\nYour innovation is a creation barely held together by your own engineering, always on the edge of completely falling apart. Though this adds risk, it also means you can coax it to perform far beyond its design specifications using special [unstable](/Traits.aspx?ID=416) actions.  \n\nWhile inventors can learn various unstable actions over their career, all at least know how to make their innovation Explode.\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-902\" />\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Peerless Inventor</title>\r\nYou are constantly inventing, and your skill at crafting is unimpeachable.

An inventor …","text":" Inventor Source Guns &amp; Gears pg. 15 PFS Note All Pathfinder Society agents have access to the Inventor class. Any tinkerer can follow a diagram to make a device, but you invent the impossible! Every strange contraption you dream up is a unique experiment pushing the edge of possibility, a mysterious machine that seems to work for only you. You're always on the verge of the next great breakthrough, and every trial and tribulation is another opportunity to test and tune. If you can dream it, you can build it. Key Ability: Intelligence At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Intelligence. Hit Points: 8 plus your Constitution modifier You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. Key Terms Gadget : Gadgets are consumable technological inventions with innovative uses. Modification : An ability with this trait alters your innovation's construction. If you have the reconfigure class feature, you can retrain these feats more easily. Unstable : Unstable actions use experimental applications of your innovation that even you can't fully predict, and that are hazardous to your innovation (and potentially you). When you take an unstable action, attempt a DC 17 flat check immediately after applying its effects. On a failure, the innovation malfunctions in a spectacular (though harmless) fashion, such as a belch of smoke or shower of sparks, and it becomes incapable of being used for further unstable actions. On a critical failure, you also take an amount of fire damage equal to your level. As the innovation's creator, you can spend 10 minutes retuning your innovation and making adjustments to return it to functionality, at which point you can use unstable actions with that innovation again. To take an unstable action, you must be using your innovation (for example, wearing an armor innovation or wielding a weapon innovation). If you have a minion innovation, some unstable actions are taken by the minion instead of you. In these cases, only the minion can take that action, and the minion needs to have been Commanded that turn to take the action. If you critically fail the flat check, the minion takes the damage instead of you. Some actions have an Unstable Function entry, which you can use to add the unstable trait for a bigger benefit. If you're unable to use unstable actions, you can still use the action normally, but you can't use the unstable function. Roleplaying the Inventor During Combat Encounters... You rely on your inventions as much as possible, testing their functionalities under a variety of conditions. You don't set out to achieve anything as banal as simply winning a fight; you seek to collect valuable data that can be used to improve your creations! During Social Encounters... You provide useful context when discussing a variety of academic topics, particularly when speaking about those subjects related to crafting and invention. You might often look for opportunities to acquire patronage to fund some of your more expensive or unorthodox experiments. After all, the materials needed to assemble your inventions don't pay for themselves! While Exploring... You study the design and construction of the environments you explore ardently, making note of clever traps, ingenious mechanisms, or especially keen architecture you come across for later. In Downtime... You brainstorm new designs, bringing them to fruition through careful crafting and meticulous attention to detail. You might also modify previous inventions to adjust for data you've collected in the field. You might work as a local smith or tinker where your skills are needed, or you might keep a workshop on the edge of town where the clank and clatter of your experiments attracts less attention. You Might... Enjoy creating new things the world has never seen before. Be willing to take a chance on a theory, testing to see if your hypothesis proves accurate. If not, you probably record the results to try again later. Wear clothes spattered with oil and grime, or venture off on excited and technical tangents when asked simple questions. Others Probably... Marvel at your inventions and the variety of unbelievable wonder they can bring. Believe that you're a genius whose work is beyond understanding. Worry that your inventions might backfire or explode.

If you attempt to fire a firearm that was fired the previous day or earlier and hasn't been cleaned since, roll a DC 5 flat check before making your attack roll. If you fail this misfire check, the weapon misfires and jams. The attack is an automatic critical failure, and you must use an Interact action to clear the jam before the weapon can be reloaded and fired again. Once you've spent at least an hour cleaning a weapon, you don't need to roll for a misfire until the next day unless an effect says otherwise. You can clean multiple firearms during this hour, up to a reasonable limit as determined by the GM (typically no more than five).\n\n Some abilities cause a weapon to misfire as a part of their effects.

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Gunslinger's Way</title>\r\nAll gunslingers have a particular way they follow, a combination of philosophy and combat style that defines both how they fight and the weapons they excel with. At 1st level, your way grants you an initial deed, a unique reload action called a slinger's reload, and proficiency with a particular skill. You also gain advanced and greater deeds at later levels, as well as access to way-specific feats.\n\n Gunslinger ways can be found [here](/classes/gunslinger/ways).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Gunslinger Feats</title>\r\nAt 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a gunslinger class feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Singular Expertise</title>\r\nYou have particular expertise with guns and crossbows that grants you greater proficiency with them and the ability to deal more damage. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to damage rolls with firearms and crossbows.\n\n This intense focus on firearms and crossbows prevents you from reaching the same heights with other weapons. Your proficiency with unarmed attacks and with weapons other than firearms and crossbows can't be higher than trained, even if you gain an ability that would increase your proficiency in one or more other weapons to match your highest weapon proficiency (such as the weapon expertise feats many ancestries have). If you have gunslinger weapon mastery, the limit is expert, and if you have gunslinging legend, the limit is master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Skill Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a skill feat.

Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to expert. When you fail, but don't critically fail, a Will save against an effect that would give you the [controlled](/Conditions.aspx?ID=6) condition, you can attempt a second save against the effect at the start of your next turn. On a successful second save, the controlled condition ends, though any other effects remain. As normal, failing this second save doesn't allow you to attempt a third save on the subsequent turn.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Ability Boosts</title>\r\nAt 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores.

Key Ability: Dexterity At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Dexterity Hit Points: 8 plus your Constitution modifier You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. Interacting to Reload The slinger's reload action from each gunslinger way, as well as many feats, give the ability to Interact to reload a weapon. This is enough to reload a weapon that takes 1 Interact action to reload, but only provides one of the Interact actions needed to reload a weapon with reload 2 or greater. As normal, you can provide the remaining Interact actions separately. Key Terms You'll see the following key terms in a number of gunslinger abilities. Flourish : Flourish actions are actions that require too much exertion to perform a large number in a row. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn. Misfire : Firearms that are improperly maintained or subjected to unusual strain can misfire. If you attempt to fire a firearm that was fired the previous day or earlier and hasn't been cleaned since, roll a DC 5 flat check before making your attack roll. If you fail this misfire check, the weapon misfires and jams.

Once you've spent at least an hour cleaning a weapon, you don't need to roll for a misfire until the next day unless an effect says otherwise. You can clean multiple firearms during this hour, up to a reasonable limit as determined by the GM (typically no more than five). Some abilities cause a weapon to misfire as a part of their effects. If such a misfire happens as a result of an attack (due to an action that causes a misfire on a failed attack, for example), it retroactively makes the attack a critical failure. Roleplaying the Gunslinger During Combat Encounters... You strike from range with your firearms, seeking to defeat your opponents before they can pose a true threat. Depending on your choice of weapon, you might prefer to strike your opponent from a hidden position before they ever realize you're there, dash through a frenzied melee with pistols blazing, or glide effortlessly across the battlefield, waiting for the perfect moment to end the conflict with a single, well-placed shot. During Social Encounters... You have a keen eye and can see things coming from farther than most. You might not be the life of the party, but your companions know to pay attention when your subtle nod or concerned grunt indicates that something's amiss. While Exploring... You scout the group's position for incoming threats and help search for secret doors and hidden passages, keeping a weather eye out for unexpected threats. In Downtime... You might craft ammunition or keep your complex weapons clean and maintained, and you might look for work that matches your unique talents, such as working as a blacksmith, engineer, or part of the local watch. You might wander from town to town, or stay put for a spell to enjoy the silence that lingers between gunfights. You Might... Seek out areas of great conflict where your unique choice of weaponry can help build your reputation. Explore new horizons, trusting your honed senses and deadly weapon to keep you safe. Demonstrate extensive knowledge about various types of guns and ammunition, along with curiosity about the latest in gun technology. Others Probably... Assume that since you know how your gun works, you must also understand how to resolve other mechanical challenges. Underestimate you at first glance, thinking you rely on your gun because you lack any other skills. Respect your eternal vigilance, unyielding grit, and excellent aim.

By delving into both the conscious and subconscious aspects of your inner self, you have awoken to the might of psychic magic, allowing you to cast spells not through incantations or gestures but by the power of your will alone. While the thin line between your mind and reality means that a single errant thought could have unintended consequences for yourself and your companions, you know that anything is possible, if you can imagine it._\r\n\r\n**Key Ability: Intelligence or Charisma** <br />\r\nAt 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Intelligence or Charisma, as determined by your choice of subconscious mind.\r\n\r\n**Hit Points: 6 plus your Constitution modifier** <br />\r\nYou increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Classes/Iconic_Thaleon.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Key Terms</title>\r\n\r\nYou'll see the following key terms in many psychic class features.\n\n **[Amp](/Traits.aspx?ID=425)**: Amps are special thoughtforms that modify the properties of your psi cantrips. You can apply an amp only to a psi cantrip, which is called the amped cantrip. Applying an amp to a psi cantrip costs 1 Focus Point and is part of the actions needed to Cast the Spell. The singular focus required to amp a psi cantrip means that unless otherwise noted, you can apply only one amp to a given psi cantrip, and you can't apply both an amp and a [metamagic](/Traits.aspx?ID=107) ability to a cantrip at the same time. If both an amp and the amped cantrip deal damage of the same type, combine their damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses. Feats with the amp trait provide different amps you can apply to psi cantrips in place of their normal amps. If an amp has its own effect, its level is the same as the amped cantrip's.\n\n **Amp Heightened**: Many amps have heightened entries similar to spells. Add the amp's heightened effects when you cast the cantrip at that level or higher. These are in addition to any heightened effects of the cantrip, though some adjust the cantrip's normal heightened entry (typically in the case of damage increases).\n\n **[Mindshift](/Traits.aspx?ID=428)**: An action with this trait can always be altered to use the raw power of your mind. When you take this action, you can choose to replace any damage it deals with mental damage, give it the mental trait, and replace any save it requires with a Will save. The action loses any traits matching damage types it no longer deals.\n\n **[Psyche](/Traits.aspx?ID=429)**: Your psyche must be unleashed to use abilities that have the psyche trait, and they end automatically when your unleashed psyche subsides.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Roleplaying the Psychic</title>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">During Combat Encounters...</title>\r\nYou rely on your collection of psychic cantrips as a mainstay, choosing where and when to amplify them for maximum effect.

Typically, you either scan for magic or investigate for psychic impressions, veiled thoughts, and wandering spirits.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">In Downtime...</title>\r\nYou strive to learn more about the depths of the mind, seeking out new spells and phenomena to uncover, knowing that as you gain a deeper understanding of yourself, you can access more of the power within.

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Psychic Spellcasting</title>\r\nYou access the vast well of power that resides within your own mind, calling forth psychic magic with nothing but thought and will. You can cast [occult](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=3) spells using the Cast a Spell activity. You alter some of the standard spell components when casting spells you know from your psychic spellcasting. Instead of speaking, you substitute any verbal components with a special mental component determined by your subconscious mind class feature. This represents how you exert your mind toward your intended effect. Any of these components impart the [concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32) trait to the spell you're casting. You also substitute any material components with somatic components, though these tend to be simple movements of the hand or head compared to those used by other spellcasters. Your spells still have clear and noticeable visual and auditory manifestations, as normal for a spellcaster.\n\n Each day, you can cast one 1st-level spell. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.\n\n As you increase in level as a psychic, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 2: Psychic Spells per Day.\n\n Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is determined by your subconscious mind, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use the modifier for the ability stated in your subconscious mind. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Heightening Spells</title> When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Cantrips</title> Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up— this is usually equal to the highest level of psychic spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level psychic, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level psychic, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.\n\n As a psychic, you get the ability to improve some of your cantrips with special benefits and psi amps. Over the course of your career, your choice of conscious mind class feature gives you extra cantrips, benefits and psi amps for cantrips, and a collection of unique psi cantrips.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Spell Repertoire</title>\r\nThe collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn one 1st-level occult spell of your choice and three occult cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the [occult](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=3) list or from other occult spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level. Your choice of conscious mind also grants you additional spells in your repertoire, starting with an additional 1st-level spell and two cantrips listed in your conscious mind, which you cast as psi cantrips (see below).\n\n You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same level. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select one 2nd-level spell, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-level version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell. Your conscious mind also adds additional spells to your repertoire as you gain spells of higher levels.\n\n Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, such as the spells you gain from your conscious mind, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Swapping Spells In Your Repertoire</title> As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Psi Cantrips and Amps</title>\r\nThe magic of your mind manifests as psi cantrips, which you can modify by spending [Focus Points](/Rules.aspx?ID=276). Like other cantrips, you can cast psi cantrips as often as you like, and they are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Your psi cantrips are in addition to the cantrips you choose from the occult list as part of your psychic spellcasting. Generally, only feats can give you more psi cantrips. Unlike other cantrips, you can't swap out psi cantrips gained from psychic feats at a later level, unless you swap out the specific feat via retraining.\n\n At 1st level, you learn three psi cantrips determined by your choice of conscious mind; one is a unique psi cantrip and two are common cantrips, typically from the occult spellcasting tradition, that you always cast as psi cantrips. You automatically gain more psi cantrips as you progress in your career as a psychic.\n\n You start with a focus pool of 2 Focus Points. However, unlike other spellcasters, you don't gain focus spells that cost Focus Points to cast. Instead, you use your Focus Points to boost or modify your psi cantrips by applying amps— specialized thoughtforms that alter the expression of your psychic power. Each of your psi cantrips has a special amp heading. Whenever you cast a psi cantrip, you can amp it by spending 1 Focus Point to add the amp effect. You can also gain additional amps through feats, allowing you to substitute a psi cantrip's normal amp effect for another one. You choose which amp to use, if you choose to use any, each time you cast a psi cantrip. Unless otherwise noted, you can apply only one amp to a given psi cantrip.\n\n You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain Focus Points by spending 10 minutes using the [Refocus](/Actions.aspx?ID=71) activity to explore your mind, whether via meditation, practicing a craft or activity that gives you the mental space to self-reflect, or talking through your thoughts and feelings with yourself or another. If you've spent Focus Points only to amp psi cantrips or fuel psychic abilities since the last time you Refocused, you regain 2 Focus Points when you Refocus, up to your maximum of 2. If you've spent Focus Points on focus spells or abilities other than those from the psychic class (for instance, to cast a focus spell you gained from an archetype), you regain only 1 Focus Point.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Unleash Psyche</title>\r\nWhen one thins the barrier between their inner mind and the outer world, one can unleash true psychic power. However, the mind wasn't meant to tap its full strength for long, leading to backlash once your unleashed psyche ends.\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-1222\" />\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Subconscious Mind</title>\r\nA psychic's power is born in the depths of their psyche, far from the surface. Your subconscious mind might represent the way your power comes to you naturally, or it may be a framework you use to safely access the infinite potential of your mind. Either way, your subconscious mind fundamentally shapes how you access and wield psychic magic. Choose a subconscious mind from the options to which you have access. This choice will determine your key ability, special spellcasting components you use, and an action you can take while you have Unleashed your Psyche. Subconscious mind options can be found [here](/classes/psychic/subconscious-minds).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Conscious Mind</title>\r\nWhatever the subconscious source of a psychic's power, all find that a specific external manifestation of their magic comes most easily to them. This conscious outward expression adds several additional spells to your spell repertoire and grants you three psi cantrips. Two of these cantrips are common spells, though you gain an extra benefit with them that other spellcasters don't get, and the last is unique to your conscious mind. You also get two more unique psi cantrips at higher levels. Choose a conscious mind from the options to which you have access.\n\nConscious mind options can be found [here](/classes/psychic/conscious-minds)\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Psychic Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a [psychic class feat](/Classes.aspx?ID=21/feats).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Skill Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a [skill feat](/feats?include-traits=Skill&amp;sort=level-asc%3Bname-asc). You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">General Feats</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a [general feat](/feats?include-traits=General&amp;sort=level-asc%3Bname-asc).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Signature Spells</title>\r\nYou've learned to cast some of your spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell level at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Skill Increases</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained.\n\n At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Ability Boosts</title>\r\nAt 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Ancestry Feats</title>\r\nIn addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Clarity of Focus</title>\r\nYour deepening connection to your mind grants you more power to fuel your psi amps. Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. This ability doesn't change the number of Focus Points you regain when you Refocus. As normal, this ability can't increase the size of your focus pool above 3 points.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Precognitive Reflexes</title>\r\nMinor precognition ensures you can react to threats slightly before they occur. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 7\">Expert Spellcaster</title>\r\nSelf-reflection has brought you greater knowledge of yourself and, with it, psychic power. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 9\">Great Fortitude</title>\r\nYour mind holds your body to a subconscious mental image of yourself. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Extrasensory Perception</title>\r\nMinor applications of clairvoyance let you know when danger is near. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Walls of Will</title>\r\nYour practiced mind resists external influence. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you succeed at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Weapon Expertise</title>\r\nTraining and magic have improved your weapon technique. Your proficiency rank for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Personal Barrier</title>\r\nSubtle telekinetic fields dampen and deflect incoming blows. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Weapon Specialization</title>\r\nAs you touch a weapon, you glimpse the hands that made and wielded it, teaching you how to inflict greater injuries. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 15\">Master Spellcaster</title>\r\nYou've gained access to the deepest corners of your own mind. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 17\">Fortress of Will</title>\r\nYour trained mind is as a fortress that none can breach. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to legendary. When you critically fail a Will save, you get a failure instead. When you fail a Will save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 19\">Infinite Mind</title>\r\nAnything you can imagine is now within the realm of possibility. Add two common 10th-level occult spells to your repertoire; you gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast one of those two spells using psychic spellcasting. You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, unlike other spell slots, and you can't use 10th-level slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. You can take the Mind over Matter psychic feat to gain a second slot.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 19\">Legendary Spellcaster</title>\r\nAs your training reaches its peak, you understand not just your own mind, but the collective unconscious from which all psychic power stems. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to legendary.","name":"Psychic","navigation":[{"label":"Details","url":"/classes/psychic"},{"label":"Feats","url":"/classes/psychic/feats"},{"label":"Sample Builds","url":"/classes/psychic/sample-builds"},{"label":"Class Kit","url":"/classes/psychic/class-kit"},{"label":"Focus Spells","url":"/classes/psychic/focus-spells"},{"label":"Conscious Minds","url":"/classes/psychic/conscious-minds"},{"label":"Subconscious Minds","url":"/classes/psychic/subconscious-minds"}],"perception_proficiency":"Trained","pfs":"Standard","rarity":"common","reflex_proficiency":"Trained","release_date":"2022-07-27","resistance":{},"search_markdown":"<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<additional-info>\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Dark Archive](/Sources.aspx?ID=129) pg. 8</row>\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nGuided by the personal combination of their subconscious and conscious mind, a psychic calls forth occult magic with but a thought.

By delving into both the conscious and subconscious aspects of your inner self, you have awoken to the might of psychic magic, allowing you to cast spells not through incantations or gestures but by the power of your will alone. While the thin line between your mind and reality means that a single errant thought could have unintended consequences for yourself and your companions, you know that anything is possible, if you can imagine it. Key Ability: Intelligence or Charisma At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Intelligence or Charisma, as determined by your choice of subconscious mind. Hit Points: 6 plus your Constitution modifier You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. Key Terms You'll see the following key terms in many psychic class features. Amp : Amps are special thoughtforms that modify the properties of your psi cantrips. You can apply an amp only to a psi cantrip, which is called the amped cantrip. Applying an amp to a psi cantrip costs 1 Focus Point and is part of the actions needed to Cast the Spell. The singular focus required to amp a psi cantrip means that unless otherwise noted, you can apply only one amp to a given psi cantrip, and you can't apply both an amp and a metamagic ability to a cantrip at the same time. If both an amp and the amped cantrip deal damage of the same type, combine their damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses. Feats with the amp trait provide different amps you can apply to psi cantrips in place of their normal amps. If an amp has its own effect, its level is the same as the amped cantrip's. Amp Heightened : Many amps have heightened entries similar to spells. Add the amp's heightened effects when you cast the cantrip at that level or higher. These are in addition to any heightened effects of the cantrip, though some adjust the cantrip's normal heightened entry (typically in the case of damage increases). Mindshift : An action with this trait can always be altered to use the raw power of your mind. When you take this action, you can choose to replace any damage it deals with mental damage, give it the mental trait, and replace any save it requires with a Will save. The action loses any traits matching damage types it no longer deals. Psyche : Your psyche must be unleashed to use abilities that have the psyche trait, and they end automatically when your unleashed psyche subsides. Roleplaying the Psychic During Combat Encounters... You rely on your collection of psychic cantrips as a mainstay, choosing where and when to amplify them for maximum effect. You weave your more conventional spells into the fray where more complex magic is needed, unleashing your mind's full potential in a blaze of power when the time is right. During Social Encounters... You navigate situations guided by the source of your subconscious power. If your power springs from your personality, you might maneuver with empathy and sociability; if it's more cerebral, you might provide a steady logical front. While Exploring... You keep your mind's eye open for the many paranormal threats that those who are less sensitive might not detect. Typically, you either scan for magic or investigate for psychic impressions, veiled thoughts, and wandering spirits. In Downtime... You strive to learn more about the depths of the mind, seeking out new spells and phenomena to uncover, knowing that as you gain a deeper understanding of yourself, you can access more of the power within. You test the limits of your adaptability by retraining to fit your evolving understanding of your potential. You Might... Show a preference for learning, meditation, dreams, or other intangible manifestations of thought over the immediacy of the physical world. Learn new things about yourself, just when you thought you knew it all. Think of your psychic magic as so much a part of you that you use it even when normal methods suffice, perhaps preferring to communicate via mental messages or levitating an object to a companion at the opposite end of a table. Others Probably... Are awed by your mental abilities, especially when your psyche is unleashed. Have difficulty understanding that the magic you perform with your mind comes from the same source as more conventional spellcasting. Wonder if you might be a monster in disguise, possessed by spirits, chosen by the gods, or have some other unusual reason for your strange powers.

One cantrip is unique to your conscious mind. † The infinite mind class feature gives you a 10th-level spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots. Ancestry and Background In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class. Psychic Spellcasting You access the vast well of power that resides within your own mind, calling forth psychic magic with nothing but thought and will. You can cast occult spells using the Cast a Spell activity. You alter some of the standard spell components when casting spells you know from your psychic spellcasting. Instead of speaking, you substitute any verbal components with a special mental component determined by your subconscious mind class feature. This represents how you exert your mind toward your intended effect. Any of these components impart the concentrate trait to the spell you're casting. You also substitute any material components with somatic components, though these tend to be simple movements of the hand or head compared to those used by other spellcasters. Your spells still have clear and noticeable visual and auditory manifestations, as normal for a spellcaster. Each day, you can cast one 1st-level spell. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots. As you increase in level as a psychic, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 2: Psychic Spells per Day. Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is determined by your subconscious mind, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use the modifier for the ability stated in your subconscious mind. Heightening Spells When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely. Cantrips Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up— this is usually equal to the highest level of psychic spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level psychic, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level psychic, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells. As a psychic, you get the ability to improve some of your cantrips with special benefits and psi amps. Over the course of your career, your choice of conscious mind class feature gives you extra cantrips, benefits and psi amps for cantrips, and a collection of unique psi cantrips. Spell Repertoire The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn one 1st-level occult spell of your choice and three occult cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the occult list or from other occult spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level. Your choice of conscious mind also grants you additional spells in your repertoire, starting with an additional 1st-level spell and two cantrips listed in your conscious mind, which you cast as psi cantrips (see below). You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same level. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select one 2nd-level spell, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-level version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell. Your conscious mind also adds additional spells to your repertoire as you gain spells of higher levels. Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, such as the spells you gain from your conscious mind, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa. Swapping Spells In Your Repertoire As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime. Psi Cantrips and Amps The magic of your mind manifests as psi cantrips, which you can modify by spending Focus Points. Like other cantrips, you can cast psi cantrips as often as you like, and they are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Your psi cantrips are in addition to the cantrips you choose from the occult list as part of your psychic spellcasting. Generally, only feats can give you more psi cantrips. Unlike other cantrips, you can't swap out psi cantrips gained from psychic feats at a later level, unless you swap out the specific feat via retraining. At 1st level, you learn three psi cantrips determined by your choice of conscious mind; one is a unique psi cantrip and two are common cantrips, typically from the occult spellcasting tradition, that you always cast as psi cantrips. You automatically gain more psi cantrips as you progress in your career as a psychic. You start with a focus pool of 2 Focus Points. However, unlike other spellcasters, you don't gain focus spells that cost Focus Points to cast. Instead, you use your Focus Points to boost or modify your psi cantrips by applying amps— specialized thoughtforms that alter the expression of your psychic power. Each of your psi cantrips has a special amp heading. Whenever you cast a psi cantrip, you can amp it by spending 1 Focus Point to add the amp effect. You can also gain additional amps through feats, allowing you to substitute a psi cantrip's normal amp effect for another one. You choose which amp to use, if you choose to use any, each time you cast a psi cantrip. Unless otherwise noted, you can apply only one amp to a given psi cantrip. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain Focus Points by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to explore your mind, whether via meditation, practicing a craft or activity that gives you the mental space to self-reflect, or talking through your thoughts and feelings with yourself or another. If you've spent Focus Points only to amp psi cantrips or fuel psychic abilities since the last time you Refocused, you regain 2 Focus Points when you Refocus, up to your maximum of 2. If you've spent Focus Points on focus spells or abilities other than those from the psychic class (for instance, to cast a focus spell you gained from an archetype), you regain only 1 Focus Point. Unleash Psyche When one thins the barrier between their inner mind and the outer world, one can unleash true psychic power. However, the mind wasn't meant to tap its full strength for long, leading to backlash once your unleashed psyche ends. Subconscious Mind A psychic's power is born in the depths of their psyche, far from the surface. Your subconscious mind might represent the way your power comes to you naturally, or it may be a framework you use to safely access the infinite potential of your mind. Either way, your subconscious mind fundamentally shapes how you access and wield psychic magic. Choose a subconscious mind from the options to which you have access. This choice will determine your key ability, special spellcasting components you use, and an action you can take while you have Unleashed your Psyche. Subconscious mind options can be found here. Conscious Mind Whatever the subconscious source of a psychic's power, all find that a specific external manifestation of their magic comes most easily to them. This conscious outward expression adds several additional spells to your spell repertoire and grants you three psi cantrips. Two of these cantrips are common spells, though you gain an extra benefit with them that other spellcasters don't get, and the last is unique to your conscious mind. You also get two more unique psi cantrips at higher levels. Choose a conscious mind from the options to which you have access. Conscious mind options can be found here Psychic Feats At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a psychic class feat. Skill Feats At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat. General Feats At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. Signature Spells You've learned to cast some of your spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell level at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does. Skill Increases At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained. At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master. Ability Boosts At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18. Ancestry Feats In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. Clarity of Focus Your deepening connection to your mind grants you more power to fuel your psi amps. Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. This ability doesn't change the number of Focus Points you regain when you Refocus. As normal, this ability can't increase the size of your focus pool above 3 points. Precognitive Reflexes Minor precognition ensures you can react to threats slightly before they occur. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert. Expert Spellcaster Self-reflection has brought you greater knowledge of yourself and, with it, psychic power. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert. Great Fortitude Your mind holds your body to a subconscious mental image of yourself. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert. Extrasensory Perception Minor applications of clairvoyance let you know when danger is near. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert. Walls of Will Your practiced mind resists external influence. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you succeed at a Will save, you get a critical success instead. Weapon Expertise Training and magic have improved your weapon technique. Your proficiency rank for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increases to expert. Personal Barrier Subtle telekinetic fields dampen and deflect incoming blows. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert. Weapon Specialization As you touch a weapon, you glimpse the hands that made and wielded it, teaching you how to inflict greater injuries. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary. Master Spellcaster You've gained access to the deepest corners of your own mind. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master. Fortress of Will Your trained mind is as a fortress that none can breach. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to legendary. When you critically fail a Will save, you get a failure instead. When you fail a Will save against a damaging effect, you take half damage. Infinite Mind Anything you can imagine is now within the realm of possibility. Add two common 10th-level occult spells to your repertoire; you gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast one of those two spells using psychic spellcasting. You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, unlike other spell slots, and you can't use 10th-level slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. You can take the Mind over Matter psychic feat to gain a second slot. Legendary Spellcaster As your training reaches its peak, you understand not just your own mind, but the collective unconscious from which all psychic power stems. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to legendary.","trait_markdown":"","type":"Class","url":"/Classes.aspx?ID=21","weakness":{},"will_proficiency":"Expert"}},{"_index":"aon18","_id":"class-22","_score":6.847722,"_source":{"ability":["Charisma"],"attack_proficiency":["Trained in simple weapons","Trained in martial weapons","Trained in unarmed attacks"],"breadcrumbs_spa":[],"category":"class","defense_proficiency":["Trained in light armor","Trained in medium armor","Trained in unarmored defense"],"exclude_from_search":false,"fortitude_proficiency":"Expert","hp":8,"hp_raw":"8","icon_image":"/Images/Class/Thaumaturge_Icon.png","id":"class-22","image":["/Images/Classes/Iconic_Mios.png"],"markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Class\" pfs=\"Standard\">[Thaumaturge](/Classes.aspx?ID=22)</title>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n<column gap=\"medium\" flex=\"1 1 400px\">\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Dark Archive](/Sources.aspx?ID=129) pg. 30</row>\n\n_The world is full of the unexplainable: ancient magic, dead gods, and even stranger things.

The class references the following Golarion- specific divination deck and zodiacs.\n\n The **Harrow** is a divination deck similar to tarot on Earth, but with six suits of nine cards each. The suits each have a symbological correspondence with one of the six ability scores. For example, the suit of hammers has a connotation of strength, and the suit of books is related to learning and intelligence.\n\n The **Cosmic Caravan** is an astrological zodiac especially common among Varisians but used throughout various regions in the Inner Sea, imagining the 13 different signs as members of a traveling caravan as well as locations and people encountered on the journey.\n\n The **Dragon Empires Zodiac** is popular across the continent of Tian Xia, particularly with the oracles of Po Li, who use it to help craft laws. It contains 12 signs, comprising the five types of [imperial dragon](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=226) as well as other creatures and archetypes of import in Tian Xia.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Key Terms</title>\r\n\r\nYou'll see the following key terms in many thaumaturge class features.\n\n **[Esoterica](/Traits.aspx?ID=427)**: The esoterica trait is present in many thaumaturge feats and class features that incorporate the various talismans, supernatural trinkets, and other objects you carry with you. Abilities that have the esoterica trait require you to be in possession of your esoterica to use them. Normally, you're assumed to always have your esoterica with you, but in some rare circumstances, you might either not have them on hand or have your gear stripped from you.\n\n **Temporary Items**: Several feats allow you to prepare temporary items. Much like the [infused](/Traits.aspx?ID=94) items created by [alchemists](/Classes.aspx?ID=1), these temporary items last only a short time before becoming useless. Temporary items are clearly not up to the same quality as other items, so they typically can't be sold. If an ability doesn't list how long a temporary item lasts, the item lasts until the next time you make your daily preparations. Any effect created by a temporary item also ends at that time if it hasn't already (unless it's a permanent effect).\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Roleplaying the Thaumaturge</title>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">During Combat Encounters...</title>\r\nYou use your implements and diverse arsenal of mystic tools and tricks to assist in combat, always presenting the right bane to exploit enemies' weaknesses or shield your allies against the supernatural.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">During Social Encounters...</title>\r\nYou understand and nudge the social connections between people, much as you strive to understand the larger ties between mysteries and concepts.

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Esoteric Lore</title>\r\nYour experience with the unknown, as well as the tales you've exchanged with other thaumaturges, has taught you about strange phenomena of every kind. You become trained in [Esoteric Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8), a special lore skill that can be used to [Recall Knowledge](/Actions.aspx?ID=26) regarding [haunts](/Traits.aspx?ID=88), [curses](/Traits.aspx?ID=38), and creatures of any type, but that can't be used to Recall Knowledge of other topics. Unlike a normal Lore skill, you use Charisma as your modifier on Esoteric Lore checks. You also gain the [Dubious Knowledge](/Feats.aspx?ID=776) skill feat.\n\n At 3rd level, you become an expert in Esoteric Lore; at 7th level, you become a master in Esoteric Lore; and at 15th level, you become legendary in Esoteric Lore.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >First Implement and Esoterica</title>\r\nYour implement is a special object of symbolic importance: your badge as you treat with the supernatural and a powerful tool if things turn violent. Choose an implement from the options to which you have access. You begin play with a mundane item of that type, and you gain the initiate benefit for that implement. While an implement is useful to you, it typically has no value if sold. If you acquire a new object of the same general implement type, you can switch your implement to the new object by spending 1 day of downtime with the new item. As you advance as a thaumaturge, you will collect up to three implements and unlock the hidden potential stored within each, so you can mix and match their benefits to suit your situation.\n\n While your implements are your primary tools in your dealings with the supernatural, you know the value of always being prepared. You constantly collect and carry various smaller mystic objects, bits of materials with paranormal affinities, and items used in folk practices: your esoterica. These might include [cold iron](/Equipment.aspx?ID=272) nails, scraps of scrolls and scriptures, fragments of bones purportedly from a saint, and other similar objects. You keep your esoterica in easy-to-access places on your person and are well practiced in brandishing your implement and esoterica together, so you can draw and use esoterica with the same hand you're using to wield an implement.\n\nImplements can be found [here](/classes/thaumaturge/implements). \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Exploit Vulnerability</title> You know that every creature, no matter how obscure, has a weakness. By identifying and empowering the right object, you can strike down even the most resilient of monsters.\n\n You gain the Exploit Vulnerability action.\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-1227\" /> You can attempt to Exploit Vulnerabilities in one of two ways: either by invoking properties that repel that type of creature, or by attempting a more improvisational, ad-hoc method with your esoterica that can impose a custom weakness on any creature, albeit one that usually isn't as dire as a creature's existing weakness.\n\n **Mortal Weakness** After identifying a creature's weakness, you use a thematically resonant bit of esoterica to attune your attacks to your discovery. Your unarmed and weapon Strikes activate the highest weakness you discovered with Exploit Vulnerability, even though the damage type your weapon deals doesn't change. This damage affects the target of your Exploit Vulnerability, as well as any other creatures of the exact same type, but not other creatures with the same weakness. For example, when fighting a pack of [werewolves](/Monsters.aspx?ID=411) you might use [silver](/Equipment.aspx?ID=277) shavings or crushed moonstone to deal damage that applies their weakness to silver to your attacks against any of the werewolves, but you wouldn't apply this damage to any other monsters with a weakness to silver.\n\n **Personal Antithesis** You improvise a custom weakness on a creature by forcefully presenting and empowering a piece of esoterica that repels it on an individual level; for instance, against a tyrant, you might procure a broken chain that once held a captive. This causes the target creature, and only the target creature, to gain a weakness against your unarmed and weapon Strikes equal to 2 + half your level.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Implement's Empowerment</title>\r\nThe power of your implement can also be turned to the more common task of combat, its power adding to and amplifying the effects of runes and other magical empowerments. When you Strike, you can trace mystic patterns with an implement you're holding to empower the Strike, causing it to deal 2 additional damage per weapon damage die. Channeling the power requires full use of your hands. You don't gain the benefit of implement's empowerment if you are holding anything in either hand other than a single one-handed weapon, other implements, or esoterica, and you must be holding at least one implement to gain the benefit.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Thaumaturge Feats</title>\r\nAt 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a [thaumaturge class feat](/Classes.aspx?ID=22/feats).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Skill Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a [skill feat](/feats?include-traits=Skill&amp;sort=level-asc%3Bname-asc). You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">General Feats</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a [general feat](/feats?include-traits=General&amp;sort=level-asc%3Bname-asc) .\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Lightning Reflexes</title>\r\nYour reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Skill Increases</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained.\n\n At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Ability Boosts</title>\r\nAt 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Ancestry Feats</title>\r\nIn addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Second Implement</title>\r\nYou've added another implement of power to your toolkit. You choose a second implement, which must be a different type of implement than your first. You gain the initiate benefit of your new implement.\n\n While you're holding an implement in one hand, you can quickly switch it with another implement you're wearing to use an action from the implement you're switching to. To do so, you can Interact as a free action immediately before executing the implement's action. This allows you to meet requirements of having an implement in hand to use its action. For example, if you had your lantern implement in one hand, a weapon in the other, and a chalice implement you were wearing, you could swap your lantern for your chalice to use its reaction.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Thaumaturge Weapon Expertise</title>\r\nYou've learned the secret ways your weapons work most effectively. Your proficiency ranks for [unarmed](/Traits.aspx?ID=199) attacks, simple weapons, and martial weapons increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 7\">Implement Adept</title>\r\nYou have deepened your connection to one of your implements, unlocking its adept power.

You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 9\">Intensify Vulnerability</title>\r\nYou've learned to use your implement to further assault a creature whose vulnerabilities you're exploiting. You gain the intensify vulnerability benefit of all of your implements, as well as the following action.\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-1228\" />\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 9\">Thaumaturgic Expertise</title>\r\nYou've learned deeper secrets of the supernatural, and your abilities are harder to resist.

Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 15\">Third Implement</title>\r\nAs you come closer to the culmination of your journey, you gain your final implement, completing your set of three.

In response, you've scavenged the best parts of every magical tradition and built up a collection of esoterica—a broken holy relic here, a sprig of mistletoe there—that you can use to best any creature by exploiting their weaknesses and vulnerabilities. The mystic implement you carry is both badge and weapon, its symbolic weight helping you bargain with and subdue the supernatural. Every path to power has its restrictions and costs, but you turn them all to your advantage. You're a thaumaturge, and you work wonders. Key Ability: Charisma At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Charisma. Hit Points: 8 plus your Constitution modifier You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. Cards and Astrology The thaumaturge class draws inspiration from symbolism pertaining to both real-world and fantasy beliefs about divination via cards or reading the stars. The class references the following Golarion- specific divination deck and zodiacs. The Harrow is a divination deck similar to tarot on Earth, but with six suits of nine cards each. The suits each have a symbological correspondence with one of the six ability scores. For example, the suit of hammers has a connotation of strength, and the suit of books is related to learning and intelligence. The Cosmic Caravan is an astrological zodiac especially common among Varisians but used throughout various regions in the Inner Sea, imagining the 13 different signs as members of a traveling caravan as well as locations and people encountered on the journey. The Dragon Empires Zodiac is popular across the continent of Tian Xia, particularly with the oracles of Po Li, who use it to help craft laws. It contains 12 signs, comprising the five types of imperial dragon as well as other creatures and archetypes of import in Tian Xia. Key Terms You'll see the following key terms in many thaumaturge class features. Esoterica : The esoterica trait is present in many thaumaturge feats and class features that incorporate the various talismans, supernatural trinkets, and other objects you carry with you. Abilities that have the esoterica trait require you to be in possession of your esoterica to use them. Normally, you're assumed to always have your esoterica with you, but in some rare circumstances, you might either not have them on hand or have your gear stripped from you. Temporary Items : Several feats allow you to prepare temporary items. Much like the infused items created by alchemists, these temporary items last only a short time before becoming useless. Temporary items are clearly not up to the same quality as other items, so they typically can't be sold. If an ability doesn't list how long a temporary item lasts, the item lasts until the next time you make your daily preparations. Any effect created by a temporary item also ends at that time if it hasn't already (unless it's a permanent effect). Roleplaying the Thaumaturge During Combat Encounters... You use your implements and diverse arsenal of mystic tools and tricks to assist in combat, always presenting the right bane to exploit enemies' weaknesses or shield your allies against the supernatural. During Social Encounters... You understand and nudge the social connections between people, much as you strive to understand the larger ties between mysteries and concepts. This helps you to find common ground when negotiating between the mundane and supernatural or even to play one side against the other. While Exploring... You investigate unexplainable phenomena around you, taking appropriate precautions to ward yourself and your allies against paranormal threats. Where necessary, you create your own path through the unknown. In Downtime... You research deeper into the supernatural mysteries you discovered on your last adventure to see how they can be applied in the future. You dust off relics, cultivate herbs, or forge trinkets, updating your collection of scavenged supernatural tools after each new threat you encounter. You return or call in favors with other people, strange creatures, and mystical forces. You Might... Prepare for the worst while improvising as necessary, impressing your allies when you're able to handle anything that fate throws at you. Assume everything is connected on a deeper level, rather than be content with what you find on the surface. Obsess over a certain supernatural phenomenon, attempting to tie everything back to it. Others Probably... Look to you to learn the weaknesses of a supernatural threat when one rears its head. Even when your explanations are invented on the fly, they just seem to work. Rely on you to come up with a solution when the situation seems hopeless. Mistake you for a common wizard or magician. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics. You are untrained in anything not listed unless you gain a better proficiency rank in some other way.

Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class. Esoteric Lore Your experience with the unknown, as well as the tales you've exchanged with other thaumaturges, has taught you about strange phenomena of every kind. You become trained in Esoteric Lore, a special lore skill that can be used to Recall Knowledge regarding haunts, curses, and creatures of any type, but that can't be used to Recall Knowledge of other topics. Unlike a normal Lore skill, you use Charisma as your modifier on Esoteric Lore checks. You also gain the Dubious Knowledge skill feat. At 3rd level, you become an expert in Esoteric Lore; at 7th level, you become a master in Esoteric Lore; and at 15th level, you become legendary in Esoteric Lore. First Implement and Esoterica Your implement is a special object of symbolic importance: your badge as you treat with the supernatural and a powerful tool if things turn violent. Choose an implement from the options to which you have access. You begin play with a mundane item of that type, and you gain the initiate benefit for that implement. While an implement is useful to you, it typically has no value if sold. If you acquire a new object of the same general implement type, you can switch your implement to the new object by spending 1 day of downtime with the new item. As you advance as a thaumaturge, you will collect up to three implements and unlock the hidden potential stored within each, so you can mix and match their benefits to suit your situation. While your implements are your primary tools in your dealings with the supernatural, you know the value of always being prepared. You constantly collect and carry various smaller mystic objects, bits of materials with paranormal affinities, and items used in folk practices: your esoterica. These might include cold iron nails, scraps of scrolls and scriptures, fragments of bones purportedly from a saint, and other similar objects. You keep your esoterica in easy-to-access places on your person and are well practiced in brandishing your implement and esoterica together, so you can draw and use esoterica with the same hand you're using to wield an implement. Implements can be found here. Exploit Vulnerability You know that every creature, no matter how obscure, has a weakness. By identifying and empowering the right object, you can strike down even the most resilient of monsters. You gain the Exploit Vulnerability action. You can attempt to Exploit Vulnerabilities in one of two ways: either by invoking properties that repel that type of creature, or by attempting a more improvisational, ad-hoc method with your esoterica that can impose a custom weakness on any creature, albeit one that usually isn't as dire as a creature's existing weakness. Mortal Weakness After identifying a creature's weakness, you use a thematically resonant bit of esoterica to attune your attacks to your discovery. Your unarmed and weapon Strikes activate the highest weakness you discovered with Exploit Vulnerability, even though the damage type your weapon deals doesn't change. This damage affects the target of your Exploit Vulnerability, as well as any other creatures of the exact same type, but not other creatures with the same weakness. For example, when fighting a pack of werewolves you might use silver shavings or crushed moonstone to deal damage that applies their weakness to silver to your attacks against any of the werewolves, but you wouldn't apply this damage to any other monsters with a weakness to silver. Personal Antithesis You improvise a custom weakness on a creature by forcefully presenting and empowering a piece of esoterica that repels it on an individual level; for instance, against a tyrant, you might procure a broken chain that once held a captive. This causes the target creature, and only the target creature, to gain a weakness against your unarmed and weapon Strikes equal to 2 + half your level. Implement's Empowerment The power of your implement can also be turned to the more common task of combat, its power adding to and amplifying the effects of runes and other magical empowerments. When you Strike, you can trace mystic patterns with an implement you're holding to empower the Strike, causing it to deal 2 additional damage per weapon damage die. Channeling the power requires full use of your hands. You don't gain the benefit of implement's empowerment if you are holding anything in either hand other than a single one-handed weapon, other implements, or esoterica, and you must be holding at least one implement to gain the benefit. Thaumaturge Feats At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a thaumaturge class feat. Skill Feats At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat. General Feats At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat . Lightning Reflexes Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert. Skill Increases At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained. At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master. Ability Boosts At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18. Ancestry Feats In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. Second Implement You've added another implement of power to your toolkit. You choose a second implement, which must be a different type of implement than your first. You gain the initiate benefit of your new implement. While you're holding an implement in one hand, you can quickly switch it with another implement you're wearing to use an action from the implement you're switching to. To do so, you can Interact as a free action immediately before executing the implement's action. This allows you to meet requirements of having an implement in hand to use its action. For example, if you had your lantern implement in one hand, a weapon in the other, and a chalice implement you were wearing, you could swap your lantern for your chalice to use its reaction.

This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.

You gain the intensify vulnerability benefit of all of your implements, as well as the following action. Thaumaturgic Expertise You've learned deeper secrets of the supernatural, and your abilities are harder to resist. Your proficiency rank for your thaumaturge class DC increases to expert. You also gain an additional skill increase, which you can apply only to Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion.
