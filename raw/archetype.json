The edicts and anathema of the Pathfinder Society are as follows: <br /> **Edicts:** Explore important sites, report and record your discoveries, and cooperate with fellow Pathfinders <br /> **Anathema:** Fail to explore, report and cooperate; defy the will of a venture-captain or the Decemvirate_\r\n\r\nYou are a skilled and dedicated warrior of the battlefield who specializes in fighting astride a powerful animal companion that serves as your mount. You and your mount are an unparalleled team, moving with shared intent to become a powerful force on the battlefield. You might wield a banner in the name of a greater organization, a liege, or an ideal you uphold, or you might fight solely to further enrich your own prestige, reputation, and coffers.\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Cavalier Pledges</title>\r\n\r\nMany cavaliers pledge themselves in service to a specific organization or individual, such as a noble family or sovereign ruler, a knightly order or another organization, or a particular ideal. A cavalier pledged to an order or ideal must uphold its edicts and is beholden to any anathema it has; for example, a cavalier pledged to the druid's [animal order](/DruidicOrders.aspx?ID=1) would be tied to that anathema, while a cavalier pledged to the church of [Abadar](/Deities.aspx?ID=1) would be held to the same standards as a cleric of that god.

The edicts and anathema of the Pathfinder Society are as follows: Edicts: Explore important sites, report and record your discoveries, and cooperate with fellow Pathfinders Anathema: Fail to explore, report and cooperate; defy the will of a venture-captain or the Decemvirate You are a skilled and dedicated warrior of the battlefield who specializes in fighting astride a powerful animal companion that serves as your mount. You and your mount are an unparalleled team, moving with shared intent to become a powerful force on the battlefield. You might wield a banner in the name of a greater organization, a liege, or an ideal you uphold, or you might fight solely to further enrich your own prestige, reputation, and coffers. Cavalier Pledges Many cavaliers pledge themselves in service to a specific organization or individual, such as a noble family or sovereign ruler, a knightly order or another organization, or a particular ideal. A cavalier pledged to an order or ideal must uphold its edicts and is beholden to any anathema it has; for example, a cavalier pledged to the druid's animal order would be tied to that anathema, while a cavalier pledged to the church of Abadar would be held to the same standards as a cleric of that god. If you pledge yourself to an entity or cause without a stated anathema, you should work with your GM to determine the edicts and anathema associated with your pledge.

It's a particularly helpful multiclass for characters with weaker martial abilities. \n<ul><li>[Alchemist](/Classes.aspx?ID=1) summoners can use their eidolons as lab assistants or even as the source of experiments. They are a good fit for [construct](/Eidolons.aspx?ID=4) or [plant](/Eidolons.aspx?ID=9)  eidolons.</li><li>[Barbarian](/Classes.aspx?ID=2) summoners find themselves drawn to the fury of [anger phantoms](/Eidolons.aspx?ID=2), the two fueled by the same inner instinct.</li><li>[Bard](/Classes.aspx?ID=3) summoners inspire their eidolons to greater heights with their bardic performances. They often team up with eidolons who pair well with their muse, such as a [fey](/Eidolons.aspx?ID=8) eidolon for a [polymath muse](/Muses.aspx?ID=3) or a phantom eidolon for a [warrior muse](/Muses.aspx?ID=4).</li><li>[Champion](/Classes.aspx?ID=4) summoners get along best with divine eidolons matching the alignment associated with their cause—[angel](/Eidolons.aspx?ID=1) eidolons for the [tenets of good](/Tenets.aspx?ID=1), devil eidolons for a [tyrant](/Causes.aspx?ID=4), and so on. This allows the champion and eidolon to have a unity in philosophy and purpose that other eidolon choices might lack.</li><li>[Cleric](/Classes.aspx?ID=5) summoners often find a connection to eidolons associated with their deity, such as a [Sarenite](/Deities.aspx?ID=16) cleric who chooses an angel eidolon. Clerics' ability to heal and support allows them to keep their eidolon healthy.</li><li>[Druid](/Classes.aspx?ID=6) summoners find the life link with primal eidolons to be a religious experience. They are especially likely to bond with eidolons that match their order, such as plant eidolons for the [leaf order](/DruidicOrders.aspx?ID=2) or [beast](/Eidolons.aspx?ID=3) eidolons for the [animal](/DruidicOrders.aspx?ID=1) or [wild ](/DruidicOrders.aspx?ID=4) order.</li><li>[Fighter](/Classes.aspx?ID=7) summoners use tactics and techniques with their eidolons to best foes. They can partner with eidolons of any kind, but they work especially well with eidolons who provide utilities that complement their fighting style.</li><li>[Monk](/Classes.aspx?ID=8) summoners often choose eidolons that are on their own path to enlightenment, to help enrich the monk's journey. These might be divine eidolons, especially if the monk is religious or uses divine ki spells, but they also might be phantoms seeking to transcend their phantom existence to reach the afterlife.</li><li>[Ranger](/Classes.aspx?ID=9) summoners get along best with beast and plant eidolons, but they make a good team with other eidolons as well, especially when an archer ranger teams up with a melee eidolon.</li><li>[Rogue](/Classes.aspx?ID=10) summoners gain a partner in crime that can disappear when necessary, providing the eidolon with the ultimate getaway as long as no one expects it to carry back loot from a heist. Rogues work well with tricky eidolons, such as fey, and they get a lot of mileage out of sharing their skills with their eidolon. The [Unfetter Eidolon](/Feats.aspx?ID=2893) feat can be especially useful if the rogue wants to establish a quick alibi far from the eidolon's crimes.</li><li>[Sorcerer](/Classes.aspx?ID=11) summoners often choose eidolons that match closely to their bloodline, such as a [psychopomp](/Eidolons.aspx?ID=10) eidolon for the [psychopomp bloodline](/Bloodlines.aspx?ID=13).

Alchemist summoners can use their eidolons as lab assistants or even as the source of experiments. They are a good fit for construct or plant eidolons. Barbarian summoners find themselves drawn to the fury of anger phantoms, the two fueled by the same inner instinct. Bard summoners inspire their eidolons to greater heights with their bardic performances. They often team up with eidolons who pair well with their muse, such as a fey eidolon for a polymath muse or a phantom eidolon for a warrior muse. Champion summoners get along best with divine eidolons matching the alignment associated with their cause—angel eidolons for the tenets of good, devil eidolons for a tyrant, and so on. This allows the champion and eidolon to have a unity in philosophy and purpose that other eidolon choices might lack. Cleric summoners often find a connection to eidolons associated with their deity, such as a Sarenite cleric who chooses an angel eidolon. Clerics' ability to heal and support allows them to keep their eidolon healthy. Druid summoners find the life link with primal eidolons to be a religious experience. They are especially likely to bond with eidolons that match their order, such as plant eidolons for the leaf order or beast eidolons for the animal or wild order. Fighter summoners use tactics and techniques with their eidolons to best foes. They can partner with eidolons of any kind, but they work especially well with eidolons who provide utilities that complement their fighting style. Monk summoners often choose eidolons that are on their own path to enlightenment, to help enrich the monk's journey. These might be divine eidolons, especially if the monk is religious or uses divine ki spells, but they also might be phantoms seeking to transcend their phantom existence to reach the afterlife. Ranger summoners get along best with beast and plant eidolons, but they make a good team with other eidolons as well, especially when an archer ranger teams up with a melee eidolon. Rogue summoners gain a partner in crime that can disappear when necessary, providing the eidolon with the ultimate getaway as long as no one expects it to carry back loot from a heist. Rogues work well with tricky eidolons, such as fey, and they get a lot of mileage out of sharing their skills with their eidolon. The Unfetter Eidolon feat can be especially useful if the rogue wants to establish a quick alibi far from the eidolon's crimes. Sorcerer summoners often choose eidolons that match closely to their bloodline, such as a psychopomp eidolon for the psychopomp bloodline. The eidolon might even be part of the story of how the sorcerer gained their bloodline. Wizard summoners are especially appreciative of an eidolon to help them in combat, and they tend to favor arcane eidolons like dragon and construct eidolons. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-2954\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-2955\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-2956\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-2957\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-2958\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-2959\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-2960\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-2961\" />","trait_markdown":"","type":"Archetype","url":"/Archetypes.aspx?ID=96","weakness":{}}},{"_index":"aon18","_id":"archetype-97","_score":4.8705597,"_source":{"archetype":["Cathartic Mage"],"archetype_category":["Mystical","Core"],"breadcrumbs_spa":[],"category":"archetype","exclude_from_search":false,"id":"archetype-97","level":2,"markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Archetype 2\" pfs=\"Limited\">[Cathartic Mage](/Archetypes.aspx?ID=97)</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n</traits>\n\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Secrets of Magic](/Sources.aspx?ID=96) pg. 194 <sup>1.1</sup></row>\n\nEmotions are powerful, and you can tap into that power to enhance your magic for a time.

Catharsis Activation Reduce the value of any frightened or stupefied condition you have by 1 and end any persistent mental damage you have.

Spell: hideous laughter Emotional Fallout You become fatigued until you Settle your Emotions. Focus Spell Unimpeded Stride Love Source Secrets of Magic pg. 197 1.1 You're joined by the bonds of love and nothing can break that, but love can distract you from other things in your life. Your emotional focus is someone you're in love with; they aren't required to love you back. Catharsis Trigger Your emotional focus takes damage from an enemy while within 30 feet of you. Catharsis Activation If either you or your emotional focus is confused or controlled, one of you can attempt a new saving throw against one confusing or controlling effect (if it allowed a save), ending the condition if the new save is a success. If both of you are eligible, your emotional focus gets the new save. Emotional Fervor You gain a +1 status bonus to Will saves.

Spell: soothe Emotional Fallout You're fascinated with your emotional focus for 1 minute.

That target takes persistent damage of the same type the spell dealt, of an amount equal to the highest amount of persistent damage you currently have. You can't choose a creature that's already taking persistent damage.

While some class feats might no longer work or be necessary with the flexible spellcaster archetype, in many cases you can make a simple replacement and continue using the class feat. The following class feats simply require replacing “a spell you have prepared” or “a prepared spell” for “a spell in your collection” or “a spell slot.” For example, in [Counterspell](/Feats.aspx?ID=633), you'd replace “a spell you have prepared” in the trigger for “a spell in your collection” and “expend a prepared spell” for “expend a spell slot.” Similarly, in arcane bond, you'd replace “cast one spell you prepared today and already cast” with “cast one spell in your collection you've already cast today.”\n\n The Counterspell and [Leyline Conduit](/Feats.aspx?ID=354) feats in the _Core Rulebook_ need these substitutions, as does [Form Retention](/Feats.aspx?ID=1839) from the _Advanced Player's Guide_. [Spell Mastery](/Feats.aspx?ID=1843) provides additional restricted spells, like divine font or specialist spells; you can take it, but it doesn't add to your collection and works like normal prepared spells. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Disallowed Feats</title> The following feats from the _Core Rulebook_ aren't available for a flexible spellcaster: [Call of the Wild](/Feats.aspx?ID=317), [Clever Counterspell](/Feats.aspx?ID=653), [Infinite Possibilities](/Feats.aspx?ID=660), [Reprepare Spell](/Feats.aspx?ID=661), and [Spell Combination](/Feats.aspx?ID=664).

Flexible Spell Preparation (1st) This class feature alters your spellcasting class feature (such as Arcane Spellcasting for the wizard or Divine Spellcasting for the cleric). If you choose this class archetype, you must select Flexible Spellcaster Dedication as your 2nd-level class feat. Prerequisites : You must have a class, such as clerics, druids, witches, and wizards, that prepares spells in spell slots using the same number of prepared spells per day. Flexible Spellcaster Adjustments : You learn spells as normal for your class (a wizard uses a spellbook, a witch teaches spells to their familiar, and so on), but change your spellcasting from your class as follows. You can cast fewer spells each day. Your number of spell slots per day don't advance from 2 to 3 spells at even levels (see Table 5—1). Reduce the number of cantrips you gain from your class by 2. This archetype doesn't change the way you prepare cantrips. During your daily preparations, you prepare a spell collection rather than preparing spells into each spell slot individually. The number of spells in your spell collection each day equals the total number of spell slots you get each day from your class spells. Select these spells from the same source as normal, such as from a spellbook for a wizard. You can cast any of the spells in your collection by using a spell slot of an appropriate level. For instance, if you were level 1 and had feather fall and magic missile in your spell collection, you could cast feather fall twice that day, magic missile twice, or each spell once. Extra spell slots you gain that have additional restrictions, like the wizard's specialist school spells or the cleric's divine font spells, don't change due to this archetype, nor do such spells count toward the number of spells you place in your spell collection. See the Restricted Spell Slots sidebar. ## Table 5-1: Flexible Spellcaster Spells per Day Level Cantrips 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th 10th Collection 1 3 2 — — — — — — — — — 2 2 4 2 — — — — — — — — — 2 3 4 2 2 — — — — — — — — 4 4 5 2 2 — — — — — — — — 4 5 5 2 2 2 — — — — — — — 6 6 5 2 2 2 — — — — — — — 6 7 5 2 2 2 2 — — — — — — 8 8 5 2 2 2 2 — — — — — — 8 9 5 2 2 2 2 2 — — — — — 10 10 5 2 2 2 2 2 — — — — — 10 11 5 2 2 2 2 2 2 — — — — 12 12 5 2 2 2 2 2 2 — — — — 12 13 5 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 — — — 14 14 5 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 — — — 14 15 5 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 — — 16 16 5 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 — — 16 17 5 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 — 18 18 5 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 — 18 19 5 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 18 20 5 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 18 Your class most likely has a class feature that gives you a single 10th level spell slot that works a bit differently from other slots. If so, flexible spellcaster doesn't change the way that spell works. Heightening Spells Once you gain 2nd-level spells, you can heighten any spell in your spell collection to any level you can cast, similar to a spontaneous spellcaster's signature spells. The only restriction is that you must select at least one 1st-level spell for your collection each time you prepare, ensuring that you can use all your spell slots each day. Adjudicating Class Feats And Features Some of your class feats or features might rely on the fact that you prepare spells in spell slots. While some class feats might no longer work or be necessary with the flexible spellcaster archetype, in many cases you can make a simple replacement and continue using the class feat. The following class feats simply require replacing “a spell you have prepared” or “a prepared spell” for “a spell in your collection” or “a spell slot.” For example, in Counterspell, you'd replace “a spell you have prepared” in the trigger for “a spell in your collection” and “expend a prepared spell” for “expend a spell slot.” Similarly, in arcane bond, you'd replace “cast one spell you prepared today and already cast” with “cast one spell in your collection you've already cast today.” The Counterspell and Leyline Conduit feats in the Core Rulebook need these substitutions, as does Form Retention from the Advanced Player's Guide . Spell Mastery provides additional restricted spells, like divine font or specialist spells; you can take it, but it doesn't add to your collection and works like normal prepared spells. Disallowed Feats The following feats from the Core Rulebook aren't available for a flexible spellcaster: Call of the Wild, Clever Counterspell, Infinite Possibilities, Reprepare Spell, and Spell Combination. The disallowed feats from the Advanced Player's Guide are as follows: Elemental Summons, Miraculous Possibility, Rites of Convocation, and Rites of Transfiguration.

Restricted Spell Slots When applying this archetype to a class that grants additional spell slots with restrictions, such as the specialist wizard's specialist school spells or the cleric's divine bond, you still gain those additional slots, but they work as normal for your class, and they don't add more spells to your spell collection. A healing font grants you additional spell slots to cast heal spells of the highest level you can cast, but doesn't add heal to your spell collection. A harming font does the same for the harm spell. As a specialist wizard, you prepare one spell per level from your specialty school, which also aren't added to your spell collection.

You must select Wellspring Mage Dedication as your 2nd-level class feat.\n\n **Prerequisites**: You must have a class that casts spells with a spell repertoire.\n\n **Wellspring Mage Adjustments**: You learn spells as normal for your class, but change your spontaneous spellcasting in the following ways.\n\n You can cast fewer spells each day unless you gain more spells thanks to your wellspring. Reduce your number of spell slots of each spell level by 1. Reduce the number of cantrips you gain from your class by 1.\n\n A wellspring of magic fills you with power that's not fully under your control. When you roll initiative for a non-trivial combat encounter, as well as in other high-stress situations of the GM's choice, magic wells up within you. Attempt a DC 6 flat check. \n\n **Critical Success** You temporarily recover an expended spell slot of any level of your choice. The temporary spell slot lasts for 1 minute, and if you don't use it by then, you experience an immediate wellspring surge. <br />**Success** As critical success, except you randomly determine the level of spell slot from among your top three spell levels (or all your levels of spell slots if you have fewer than three). The slot lasts 3 rounds instead of 1 minute. <br />**Failure** You generate a wellspring surge, with a spell level chosen randomly among your top three levels of spell slots (or all your levels if you have fewer than three). \n\nYou can gain a temporary spell slot no more than twice per day. If you would gain a temporary spell slot for a level that has no expended spell slots, there's no effect. If you use a temporary slot to cast a spell with a duration, the spell ends whenever you would have lost the slot if its duration hasn't yet elapsed. If you roll for wellspring magic while you currently have a temporary spell slot, you automatically fail the flat check.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Wellspring Surges</title>\r\n\r\nWhen your wellspring magic goes out of control, it becomes a wellspring surge. Typically, this happens when you fail the flat check from wellspring magic, but other wellspring mage feats have effects that sometimes cause you to generate a wellspring surge, or might even cause your foes to do so.\n\n Roll 1d20 and use Table 5–2: Wellspring Surges below to determine the surge's effect. If the effect calls for a damage type, the GM chooses the type based on the types of spells you know or your current location. The wellspring surge uses your spell DC. You have no control over the way your wellspring surge manifests. You are the point of origin for your wellspring surges, and you are not excluded from their effects. If you force a foe to generate a surge, they are the origin point of that surge instead.\n\n If your wellspring was granted by a being like a god or muse, the entity's intentions might sometimes alter the results of wellspring surges, or move the point of origin for an area to any point within 30 feet if the GM determines this fits the situation. For example, instead of uncontrolled damage, the entity might choose to damage only creatures opposing its plan, even if they are your allies.\n\n A wellspring surge always has the trait of your magical tradition, plus any traits that appear in parentheses at the end of the surge's effects.\n\n## Table 5-2: Wellspring Surges\n<row gap=\"tiny\">\n<table> <tr><td>**d20**</td><td>**Effect**</td></tr> <tr><td>1</td><td>**Energy Unleashed** ([evocation](/Traits.aspx?ID=65)) Raw energy deals 2d6 damage per spell level of the surge ([basic](/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Reflex save) in a 10-foot burst.</td></tr> <tr><td>2</td><td>**Positive Energy Expulsion** ([healing](/Traits.aspx?ID=89), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117), [positive](/Traits.aspx?ID=128)) Positive energy explodes outward, healing living creatures for 1d8 Hit Points per spell level of the surge in a 20-foot burst.

Wellspring Magic (1st) You regain magic power quickly, but it can be difficult for you to control. You must select Wellspring Mage Dedication as your 2nd-level class feat. Prerequisites : You must have a class that casts spells with a spell repertoire. Wellspring Mage Adjustments : You learn spells as normal for your class, but change your spontaneous spellcasting in the following ways. You can cast fewer spells each day unless you gain more spells thanks to your wellspring. Reduce your number of spell slots of each spell level by 1. Reduce the number of cantrips you gain from your class by 1. A wellspring of magic fills you with power that's not fully under your control. When you roll initiative for a non-trivial combat encounter, as well as in other high-stress situations of the GM's choice, magic wells up within you. Attempt a DC 6 flat check. Critical Success You temporarily recover an expended spell slot of any level of your choice. The temporary spell slot lasts for 1 minute, and if you don't use it by then, you experience an immediate wellspring surge. Success As critical success, except you randomly determine the level of spell slot from among your top three spell levels (or all your levels of spell slots if you have fewer than three). The slot lasts 3 rounds instead of 1 minute. Failure You generate a wellspring surge, with a spell level chosen randomly among your top three levels of spell slots (or all your levels if you have fewer than three). You can gain a temporary spell slot no more than twice per day. If you would gain a temporary spell slot for a level that has no expended spell slots, there's no effect. If you use a temporary slot to cast a spell with a duration, the spell ends whenever you would have lost the slot if its duration hasn't yet elapsed. If you roll for wellspring magic while you currently have a temporary spell slot, you automatically fail the flat check. Wellspring Surges When your wellspring magic goes out of control, it becomes a wellspring surge. Typically, this happens when you fail the flat check from wellspring magic, but other wellspring mage feats have effects that sometimes cause you to generate a wellspring surge, or might even cause your foes to do so. Roll 1d20 and use Table 5–2: Wellspring Surges below to determine the surge's effect. If the effect calls for a damage type, the GM chooses the type based on the types of spells you know or your current location. The wellspring surge uses your spell DC. You have no control over the way your wellspring surge manifests. You are the point of origin for your wellspring surges, and you are not excluded from their effects. If you force a foe to generate a surge, they are the origin point of that surge instead. If your wellspring was granted by a being like a god or muse, the entity's intentions might sometimes alter the results of wellspring surges, or move the point of origin for an area to any point within 30 feet if the GM determines this fits the situation. For example, instead of uncontrolled damage, the entity might choose to damage only creatures opposing its plan, even if they are your allies. A wellspring surge always has the trait of your magical tradition, plus any traits that appear in parentheses at the end of the surge's effects. ## Table 5-2: Wellspring Surges d20 Effect 1 Energy Unleashed (evocation) Raw energy deals 2d6 damage per spell level of the surge (basic Reflex save) in a 10-foot burst. 2 Positive Energy Expulsion (healing, necromancy, positive) Positive energy explodes outward, healing living creatures for 1d8 Hit Points per spell level of the surge in a 20-foot burst. Undead creatures instead take the same amount of positive damage, with a basic Will save. 3 Mass Siphon (transmutation) Creatures and objects within a 30-foot emanation become nearly weightless until the end of your next turn. Nearly weightless creatures can Climb at their land Speed and can Leap as far upward as they could normally Leap horizontally. 4 Magical Nemesis (conjuration, teleportation) A random creature connected to your magic (or inimical to it) appears within 60 feet. The creature should be of a level approximately equal to the level of an animal summoned by summon animal of the spell level, although it can be of any type. The GM determines the specific creature. The creature is unfriendly to you and friendly to your apparent enemies. After 1 minute, the creature can choose either to return where it came from or to remain. It is not summoned or a minion. 5 Monstrous Transformation (mental, morph, transmutation) Your head and arms transform into an exaggerated imitation of a creature connected to your magic for 1 minute. The GM determines the creature. You gain a status bonus to weapon and unarmed damage rolls equal to the spell level. At the start of each of your turns while you are transformed, you must succeed at a Will saving throw or be confused until the start of your next turn. On a critical success, you can choose to end the effect entirely, also losing the status bonus. 6 Sudden Gale (air, evocation) Weather in a 40-foot emanation is disturbed. Strong winds blow in a random direction for 1 minute. Each creature that starts its turn in the area must succeed at a Fortitude save or fall prone (and be pushed 10 feet on a critical failure), and you must succeed at this save immediately after the surge. Any movement against the wind is difficult terrain, or greater difficult terrain while flying. 7 Tremor (earth, evocation) The earth trembles in a 40-foot emanation. Each creature on a surface must immediately succeed at a Fortitude save or fall prone. The surface then becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute. 8 Oppressive Voice (divination, mental, nonlethal) The voice of your muse, your deity, an ancestor, or another appropriate entity suddenly overwhelms your mind. You must attempt a Will saving throw. You take 1d4 mental damage per spell level with a basic Will save. On a failure, you're also stunned 1 (stunned 2 on a critical failure). 9 Trinket Squall (illusion) Visual illusions of objects related to your magic fall like rain throughout a 40-foot burst for 1 minute, giving concealment in the area. Creatures can attempt to disbelieve this illusion. 10 Antimagic Eruption (abjuration) The surge attempts to counteract a random spell active on you and on each creature within a 10-foot burst. 11 Mental Broadcast (detection, divination, mental) For 1 minute, everyone within 30 feet of you can hear your surface thoughts. 12 Verdant Clutch (conjuration, plant) Plants and vines grow from all surfaces within 20 feet, causing all creatures in the area to be immobilized unless they succeed at a Reflex save. The Escape DC is equal to the spell DC. 13 Tinge of Terror (emotion, enchantment, fear, mental) All creatures within 20 feet are affected by powerful fright. They attempt a Will save, becoming frightened 1 on a failure or frightened 2 on a critical failure. 14 Strike up the Band (auditory, illusion) For 1 minute, you are followed by orchestral theme music tied to the emotional content of the actions you're performing. This grants you a +2 status bonus to Diplomacy, Intimidation, and Performance checks, a –2 status penalty to Deception checks, and makes certain uses of Stealth virtually impossible. It might have other effects as the GM sees fit. 15 Life Sap (necromancy) The surge drains your life force and strength. You become drained 1 and doomed 1, and you are enfeebled 2 for 1 minute. 16 Ablative Barrier (abjuration) Energy forms a protective barrier that ablates slowly as creatures in the area take damage. All creatures in a 40-foot burst gain resistance to all damage equal to double the surge's spell level for up to 1 minute. Whenever a creature applies this resistance, the resistance for all affected creatures reduces by 1. The effect ends for all creatures when it reduces to 0. 17 Luminous Pests (illusion, visual) Numerous tiny flying creatures formed of bright colorful light, such as bats or hummingbirds, emerge from you, flying in a 30-foot cone. You and all creatures in the cone must succeed at a Will save or be dazzled for 1 minute, or blinded for 1 round and then dazzled for 1 minute on a critical failure. 18 Emotional Turmoil (emotion, enchantment, mental) A swirl of conflicting emotions overwhelm you from the surging magic. For 1 minute, attempt a DC 11 flat check at the start of each of your turns. On a success, you gain a +2 status bonus to all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks; on a failure, you take a –2 status penalty to them instead. 19 Sudden Downpour (evocation, water) Water cascades from above, putting out non-magical fires in a 10-foot burst and attempting to counteract magical fires. 20 Spell Surge You immediately cast any spell in your repertoire of the surge's spell level or lower (or from your prepared spells or innate spells if you don't have a repertoire but have been forced to generate a wellspring surge). You must choose a spell that takes 3 or fewer actions to cast. Click here for more rules on using this archetype.

If they meet the Intelligence requirements, clerics of deities who encourage invention and experimentation like Brigh are an amazing fit, both because it makes narrative sense and because such characters can usually Refocus while fixing their innovation after using an unstable ability. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3113\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3114\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3115\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3116\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3117\" />","trait":["Uncommon"],"trait_markdown":"[Uncommon](/Traits.aspx?ID=159)","trait_raw":["Uncommon"],"type":"Archetype","url":"/Archetypes.aspx?ID=108","weakness":{}}},{"_index":"aon18","_id":"archetype-109","_score":4.8705597,"_source":{"archetype":["Overwatch"],"archetype_category":["Combat Style","Core"],"breadcrumbs_spa":[],"category":"archetype","exclude_from_search":false,"id":"archetype-109","level":2,"markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Archetype 2\" pfs=\"Standard\">[Overwatch](/Archetypes.aspx?ID=109)</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n</traits>\n\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Guns &amp; Gears](/Sources.aspx?ID=98) pg. 50</row>\n\nWith a stalwart mind and sharp eyes, you observe the battlefield as though you and your allies are pieces on a chessboard.

It doesn't matter if it's as common as a chariot or as complex as an airship, there's always some aspect of the vehicle you can improve upon. Pilots, drivers, and sailors alike value your expertise, and many seek you out to work on their vehicles. While you can make a great profit working on custom vehicles for wealthy clients, you still keep a vehicle of your own to tinker with as your personal passion project.\n\n You might be part of a vehicle mechanic union, working with other mechanics and engineers to find fair jobs and support each other's labor. While some vehicle mechanic unions are secular, many realize the benefits of organizing alongside a sympathetic religion, and so they typically adopt the ideals of economically-focused gods like [Abadar](/Deities.aspx?ID=1) or deities interested in crafting such as the goddess [Brigh](/Deities.aspx?ID=33)—the Whisper in Bronze—the goddess of invention. Whether religious or secular, vehicle mechanic unions take the bonds between fellow union members seriously. While this might mean your character becomes obligated to help a fellow union member who needs your help, it also means you have steadfast allies you can fall back on in your own time of need. In dire straits, such a connection can be worth its weight in gold.\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Unions</title>\r\n\r\nVehicle mechanics typically ply their trade to those who need to keep their vehicles finely tuned. As in most other such trades, some vehicle mechanics form unions to keep business practices fair and to protect each other from predatory employers. The Absalom Shipwright's Union is the largest union for vehicle mechanics in Absalom, with over a thousand builders, carpenters, and engineers among its membership. **Almenia Oarstone** (LG female dwarf shipwright) is the current leader of the union, having been a member for more than 60 years. It is said that you can count on one hand the number of ships that have docked in Absalom on which she has never worked. The Shipwright's Union manages shipbuilding and repairs in both the Devil's Own and the Sea King Shipyard, and sometimes dispatches members to handle jobs that need doing at the Docks.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Using Vehicles</title>\r\n\r\nThe vehicle mechanic plays best in a campaign where the PCs adventure together in one shared vehicle that the mechanic can enhance, such as in a pirate campaign on a single vessel. In this way, the vehicle mechanic archetype pairs excellently with a PC who has chosen the [trick driver](/Archetypes.aspx?ID=112) archetype.

It doesn't matter if it's as common as a chariot or as complex as an airship, there's always some aspect of the vehicle you can improve upon. Pilots, drivers, and sailors alike value your expertise, and many seek you out to work on their vehicles. While you can make a great profit working on custom vehicles for wealthy clients, you still keep a vehicle of your own to tinker with as your personal passion project. You might be part of a vehicle mechanic union, working with other mechanics and engineers to find fair jobs and support each other's labor. While some vehicle mechanic unions are secular, many realize the benefits of organizing alongside a sympathetic religion, and so they typically adopt the ideals of economically-focused gods like Abadar or deities interested in crafting such as the goddess Brigh—the Whisper in Bronze—the goddess of invention. Whether religious or secular, vehicle mechanic unions take the bonds between fellow union members seriously. While this might mean your character becomes obligated to help a fellow union member who needs your help, it also means you have steadfast allies you can fall back on in your own time of need. In dire straits, such a connection can be worth its weight in gold. Unions Vehicle mechanics typically ply their trade to those who need to keep their vehicles finely tuned. As in most other such trades, some vehicle mechanics form unions to keep business practices fair and to protect each other from predatory employers. The Absalom Shipwright's Union is the largest union for vehicle mechanics in Absalom, with over a thousand builders, carpenters, and engineers among its membership. Almenia Oarstone (LG female dwarf shipwright) is the current leader of the union, having been a member for more than 60 years. It is said that you can count on one hand the number of ships that have docked in Absalom on which she has never worked. The Shipwright's Union manages shipbuilding and repairs in both the Devil's Own and the Sea King Shipyard, and sometimes dispatches members to handle jobs that need doing at the Docks. Using Vehicles The vehicle mechanic plays best in a campaign where the PCs adventure together in one shared vehicle that the mechanic can enhance, such as in a pirate campaign on a single vessel. In this way, the vehicle mechanic archetype pairs excellently with a PC who has chosen the trick driver archetype. Vehicles are an element you should consider carefully before deciding to include, even in a guns and gears campaign. Vehicles are relatively complicated and can move very fast, which may make mapping encounters quite difficult. They can also move characters too far from the fight for other participants to respond.

After the events of Night of the Gray Death, the organization is broken—leadership is in disarray while the rank-and-file members labor to enforce laws and recapture escaped criminals.

The Gray Gardeners are the remorseless executioners of Galt. Prior to the events of the adventure, the Gray Gardeners are at best sinister (when not actively pursuing evil) as a malevolent monster controls their organization. After the events of Night of the Gray Death, the organization is broken—leadership is in disarray while the rank-and-file members labor to enforce laws and recapture escaped criminals. The Gray Gardeners still command the respect of Galt's people, however, as their brutal reputation is indelibly etched in the public consciousness over the last fifty years.

Specializing in a variety of grabs, holds, and strikes, wrestlers are dangerous opponents whose techniques can leave a foe broken and defeated without taking their life.\n\n The wrestling tradition is common all over Golarion. Gladiators and other warriors who fight for entertainment use wrestling techniques in combat. The discipline's focus on grappling is also useful in non-gladiatorial matches, as many foes are unable to contend with an opponent's hold. Grappling is particularly effective against spellcasters, who have a difficult time completing the somatic components of their spells while grabbed.\n\n Wrestlers have storied traditions in the Hold of Belkzen, where orcs use specialized grappling techniques to subdue the large animals they ride as mounts. Orcs prefer wrestling these creatures partially to minimize harm to them, but also because they believe that the process of subduing the creature creates a stronger bond between mount and rider.\n\n Outside of the Inner Sea, wrestlers are common in Iblydos and Arcadia.

Specializing in a variety of grabs, holds, and strikes, wrestlers are dangerous opponents whose techniques can leave a foe broken and defeated without taking their life. The wrestling tradition is common all over Golarion. Gladiators and other warriors who fight for entertainment use wrestling techniques in combat. The discipline's focus on grappling is also useful in non-gladiatorial matches, as many foes are unable to contend with an opponent's hold. Grappling is particularly effective against spellcasters, who have a difficult time completing the somatic components of their spells while grabbed. Wrestlers have storied traditions in the Hold of Belkzen, where orcs use specialized grappling techniques to subdue the large animals they ride as mounts. Orcs prefer wrestling these creatures partially to minimize harm to them, but also because they believe that the process of subduing the creature creates a stronger bond between mount and rider. Outside of the Inner Sea, wrestlers are common in Iblydos and Arcadia. Iblydan wrestlers focus on grappling techniques to make sure they're never left without a means to fight on the battlefield, even if their weapons are destroyed. Arcadian wrestlers engage in matches designed to retell stories of ancient gods. These matches feature impressive acrobatic feats as well as highly technical grappling maneuvers.

True Mammoth Lords are rare champions, heroes among their people who have tamed a mammoth, cave bear, triceratops, or other megafauna. They often ride these enormous creatures into battle. Astride their mighty steeds, Mammoth Lords lead their followings along migratory routes they've used for generations, and they defend their people from frost giants, white dragons, and many other perils of the far north.\n\n You're one of these legendary heroes, a true Mammoth Lord. You've captured or befriended one of the megafauna of the far north and tamed it. This heroic deed is best done as part of an adventure, but if that isn't possible, work with your GM to determine the details of how you managed to make one of these tremendous creatures your companion. You now ride this fantastic beast into battle, fighting from atop its back.\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Mammoth Lord Animal Companions</title>\r\n\r\nIf you're playing a mammoth lord, you determine the statistics and abilities of your animal companions according to the rules found [here](/Rules.aspx?ID=149). As a mammoth lord, it's possible for you to have more than one animal companion at one time—up to four companions—but only one of those companions, your “active companion,” follows you during exploration and in encounters; the rest are nearby, usually foraging or hunting for food. As soon as you gain a second animal companion from the mammoth lord archetype, you also gain Call Companion to switch your active companion. These rules apply to all your companions, regardless of whether you got the animal companion from the mammoth lord archetype or from another source.\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-601\" />\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">What Counts as Megafauna?</title>\r\n\r\nThe megafauna of the Realm of the Mammoth Lords are enormous beasts of intimidating appearance, but they can be hard to otherwise classify. While the most well-known megafauna are mammals—like the mammoth or the woolly rhinoceros—not all are.

True Mammoth Lords …","text":" Mammoth Lord May contain spoilers from Quest for the Frozen Flame Source Pathfinder #177: Burning Tundra pg. 78 The Kellid people of the far north are collectively known as the Mammoth Lords, but this name is something of a generalization. True Mammoth Lords are rare champions, heroes among their people who have tamed a mammoth, cave bear, triceratops, or other megafauna. They often ride these enormous creatures into battle. Astride their mighty steeds, Mammoth Lords lead their followings along migratory routes they've used for generations, and they defend their people from frost giants, white dragons, and many other perils of the far north. You're one of these legendary heroes, a true Mammoth Lord. You've captured or befriended one of the megafauna of the far north and tamed it. This heroic deed is best done as part of an adventure, but if that isn't possible, work with your GM to determine the details of how you managed to make one of these tremendous creatures your companion. You now ride this fantastic beast into battle, fighting from atop its back. Mammoth Lord Animal Companions If you're playing a mammoth lord, you determine the statistics and abilities of your animal companions according to the rules found here. As a mammoth lord, it's possible for you to have more than one animal companion at one time—up to four companions—but only one of those companions, your “active companion,” follows you during exploration and in encounters; the rest are nearby, usually foraging or hunting for food. As soon as you gain a second animal companion from the mammoth lord archetype, you also gain Call Companion to switch your active companion. These rules apply to all your companions, regardless of whether you got the animal companion from the mammoth lord archetype or from another source. What Counts as Megafauna? The megafauna of the Realm of the Mammoth Lords are enormous beasts of intimidating appearance, but they can be hard to otherwise classify. While the most well-known megafauna are mammals—like the mammoth or the woolly rhinoceros—not all are. Large dinosaurs like the stegosaurus and triceratops qualify as megafauna, for example, but smaller dinosaurs like raptors don't. A list of well-established megafauna can be found below, but it isn't an exclusive list; other, more unusual, species might be permitted with GM approval. One rule is certain, however: an adult megafauna is always Large or bigger. Cave Bear : Use a bear's statistics for a cave bear animal companion. Daeodon : Use a boar's statistics for a daeodon, or giant boar, companion. Dire Wolf : Use a wolf's statistics for a dire wolf companion. Mammoth : Use a elephants's statistics for the statistics for an elephant or woolly mammoth animal companion. Roc : Use bird statistics for a young roc. Smilodon : Use cat statistics for a smilodon animal companion. Triceratops : Use triceratops statistics for a triceratops or other armored dinosaur, such as a stegosaurus or ankylosaurus. Tyrannosaurus : Use tyrannosaurus statistics for for a tyrannosaurus, allosaurus, or similar dinosaur. Woolly Rhinoceros : Use rhinoceros statistics for a rhinoceros or woolly rhinoceros animal companion. Additional Feats This archetype has some feats at a level other than their original level.

Apart from the role of the _spirit dwelling_, exorcism practices can vary. For example, a [bard](/Classes.aspx?ID=3) or [rogue](/Classes.aspx?ID=10) might attract spirits with trickery, charm, or empty promises.

In Osirion, exorcists practice execration, or proactive preventive exorcism techniques. In Northern Garund and some parts of Qadira, playing the stringed tanbura, rattling manjur, and specific drum patterns help cut the threads that tie the spirit to this world.

Otherwise, they plan and carry out their own personal vendettas against the forces of undeath, often enlisting the help of trusted friends and allies. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3460\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3461\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3462\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3463\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3464\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3465\" />","trait":["Uncommon"],"trait_markdown":"[Uncommon](/Traits.aspx?ID=159)","trait_raw":["Uncommon"],"type":"Archetype","url":"/Archetypes.aspx?ID=172","weakness":{}}},{"_index":"aon18","_id":"archetype-173","_score":4.8705597,"_source":{"archetype":["Soul Warden"],"archetype_category":["Faction","Core"],"breadcrumbs_spa":[],"category":"archetype","exclude_from_search":false,"id":"archetype-173","level":2,"markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Archetype 2\" pfs=\"Standard\">[Soul Warden](/Archetypes.aspx?ID=173)</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\n\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Book of the Dead](/Sources.aspx?ID=118) pg. 26</row>\n\nYou consider yourself an honorary [psychopomp](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=83)—a shepherd of spirits who ensures the cycle of souls progresses unimpeded.

Your soul carries on, but your body is gone. Your mind, too, may have changed: though death can impact thoughts and desires in all sorts of ways, most ghosts experience stronger, more volatile emotions and are frequently overcome by their past ties. A need to reconcile the past overwhelms other needs. Motivations can change over time but are always strong. Pragmatism, compassion, and foresight fall before a [ghost's](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=51) fundamental desires.\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Incorporeality, Flight, and Rejuvenation</title>\r\n\r\nMany ghost abilities have been significantly toned down to work for a player character—most notably flight and the ability to move through walls with incorporeality. The GM has the option to loosen the reins on both abilities, allowing movement through walls as normal for the trait, granting an unlimited fly Speed of 15 feet, or both. The fly Speed replaces any other abilities that involve flying, and any feat that upgrades the PC's flying capabilities, such as the [Unlimited Ghost Flight](/Feats.aspx?ID=3503) feat, might instead upgrade this Speed by an additional 5 feet.

Your soul carries on, but your body is gone. Your mind, too, may have changed: though death can impact thoughts and desires in all sorts of ways, most ghosts experience stronger, more volatile emotions and are frequently overcome by their past ties. A need to reconcile the past overwhelms other needs. Motivations can change over time but are always strong. Pragmatism, compassion, and foresight fall before a ghost's fundamental desires. Incorporeality, Flight, and Rejuvenation Many ghost abilities have been significantly toned down to work for a player character—most notably flight and the ability to move through walls with incorporeality. The GM has the option to loosen the reins on both abilities, allowing movement through walls as normal for the trait, granting an unlimited fly Speed of 15 feet, or both. The fly Speed replaces any other abilities that involve flying, and any feat that upgrades the PC's flying capabilities, such as the Unlimited Ghost Flight feat, might instead upgrade this Speed by an additional 5 feet. However, a PC who can constantly fly and move through walls can trivialize many low- and mid-level challenges, as well as a fair number of high-level challenges, consistently outshining or leaving other characters behind; the GM should consider this option very carefully before allowing it and adjust the game accordingly. Combining the rejuvenation feat with a character whose unfinished business is tied to the adventure essentially makes the character immortal.

Becoming a living [mummy](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=74)—one capable of both motion and thought—is another thing altogether.\n\n Most of those forced into undeath as mummies are bound to tombs, temples, and vaults as guardians. Some willingly undergo the process, embracing death to live beyond it. These willing mummies become the most powerful of their kind, rising above their brethren like an emperor above their subjects.\n\n The horrifically painful living mummification process must be performed by others—usually a team of well-trained necromancers, priests, or ritualists—upon a still-living subject. Death by mummification is gruesome, but to be kept alive for as long as possible throughout the process is a thousandfold worse. The process usually takes weeks, beginning with forced starvation, followed by the consumption of spices and tonics that desiccate the subject's internal organs.\n\n Very rarely, mummies are created by natural processes occurring in locations that are cursed or inundated by negative energy. These mummies most often rise in deserts, bogs, swamps, at high altitudes, or in frigid locales.

Becoming a living mummy—one capable of both motion and thought—is another thing altogether. Most of those forced into undeath as mummies are bound to tombs, temples, and vaults as guardians. Some willingly undergo the process, embracing death to live beyond it. These willing mummies become the most powerful of their kind, rising above their brethren like an emperor above their subjects. The horrifically painful living mummification process must be performed by others—usually a team of well-trained necromancers, priests, or ritualists—upon a still-living subject. Death by mummification is gruesome, but to be kept alive for as long as possible throughout the process is a thousandfold worse. The process usually takes weeks, beginning with forced starvation, followed by the consumption of spices and tonics that desiccate the subject's internal organs. Very rarely, mummies are created by natural processes occurring in locations that are cursed or inundated by negative energy. These mummies most often rise in deserts, bogs, swamps, at high altitudes, or in frigid locales. Although the process through which they are created is less painful and far shorter in duration, the spiritual shift from living to undead is no less traumatizing. Mummies are most commonly found in Geb and Osirion, as well as the surrounding nations of Thuvia, Katapesh, and Qadira.

These minions shuffle forth with the mindless motions of the unliving and are little more than puppets under your control. Similarly, via careful tinkering and anatomical study, you learned how to make a powerful necromechanical ally. Finally, your technological prowess is such that you can use your innovations to force even powerful, free-willed [undead](/Traits.aspx?ID=160) to obey you.\n\n The secret to your success is a combination of alchemy and clockwork, machines and magic, science and spellcasting. Of course, crafting the shell of a wind-up zombie is one matter—your primary focus is on the craftwork necessary to make the whole thing work together. To you, the magic involved is only a means to an end, a way to make science more efficient through necromancy and potentially a little bit of evocation for some electric power.\n\n While some think your creations are vile, you see beauty in utility and believe animated corpses are tools that can be used for good or ill. For better or worse, when it comes to results, the science you've cobbled together fulfills the most important criterium for any new innovation: it _works_, plain and simple. Your reanimated clockwork corpses are stable, effective, and, more importantly, they don't rampage or crave the flesh of the living in the same way an undead would.

These minions shuffle forth with the mindless motions of the unliving and are little more than puppets under your control. Similarly, via careful tinkering and anatomical study, you learned how to make a powerful necromechanical ally. Finally, your technological prowess is such that you can use your innovations to force even powerful, free-willed undead to obey you. The secret to your success is a combination of alchemy and clockwork, machines and magic, science and spellcasting. Of course, crafting the shell of a wind-up zombie is one matter—your primary focus is on the craftwork necessary to make the whole thing work together. To you, the magic involved is only a means to an end, a way to make science more efficient through necromancy and potentially a little bit of evocation for some electric power. While some think your creations are vile, you see beauty in utility and believe animated corpses are tools that can be used for good or ill. For better or worse, when it comes to results, the science you've cobbled together fulfills the most important criterium for any new innovation: it works , plain and simple. Your reanimated clockwork corpses are stable, effective, and, more importantly, they don't rampage or crave the flesh of the living in the same way an undead would. Plus, they aren't vulnerable to positive energy, making them easier to use around good clerics and their ilk without your minions taking friendly fire.

Good against evil, law against chaos, civilization against nature, life against death against undeath. But why fight what you can't change? You prefer to bargain.\n\n As a pactbinder, you make deals with strange entities, otherworldly beings, and all sorts of multiversal denizens, amiable and unapproachable alike. Over the course of your many negotiations, you've learned something important: while such beings always seek a bargain tilted in their own favor, sometimes your definition of value differs enough from theirs that you can still come out ahead. In fact, sometimes, those who don't understand pacts like you do might mistake the payment for the benefit, or vice versa. Perhaps an ancient being of nightmare demanded to consume something you sought to be rid of, like a painful memory or a negative personality trait, priding itself on how it was taking something personal from you. Little did it know, you let it win on haggling your end of the deal.

Good against evil, law against chaos, civilization against nature, life against death against undeath. But why fight what you can't change? You prefer to bargain. As a pactbinder, you make deals with strange entities, otherworldly beings, and all sorts of multiversal denizens, amiable and unapproachable alike. Over the course of your many negotiations, you've learned something important: while such beings always seek a bargain tilted in their own favor, sometimes your definition of value differs enough from theirs that you can still come out ahead. In fact, sometimes, those who don't understand pacts like you do might mistake the payment for the benefit, or vice versa. Perhaps an ancient being of nightmare demanded to consume something you sought to be rid of, like a painful memory or a negative personality trait, priding itself on how it was taking something personal from you. Little did it know, you let it win on haggling your end of the deal. Of course, this practice isn't without its own risks, as who knows what you might become without that part of you.
