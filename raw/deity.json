Silver-tongued and charming, she is a master of weaving insults into compliments and laying intricate groundwork for retribution at its finest. She is a goddess of vengeance, but it would be a mistake to assume that means she pursues justice. Calistria is fickle, shifting her loyalties and interests as her whims take her—though she never forgets a slight, and any who think she has forgiven will surely find it is only a matter of time before they are targeted by a long-term plot of revenge to lay them thoroughly low.

Sailors drop boxes of cargo as offerings to avoid a fatal storm, hoping to please the Wind and the Waves, even though they know that such pleas are far more likely to go unnoticed as they are to draw their deity’s attention.

You are under the constant effects of know direction and become trained in Sailing Lore (or another Lore skill if you are already trained in Sailing Lore).

You gain a +30-foot status bonus to your Speeds, and you gain a fly Speed equal to your land Speed. Minor Curse Lightning begins to strike twice. You gain weakness 5 to electricity, and any natural or magical bolts of lightning always target you rather than the other creatures around you. Moderate Curse The current of the waves constantly fights against you, putting you at risk of drowning any time you must Swim. You lose any swim Speed you have, unless it’s your only Speed, in which case you take a –20-foot status penalty to your swim Speed. When you roll an Athletics check to Swim, you always use the outcome for one degree of success worse than the result of your roll. Major Curse Those who displease Gozreh are shunned by nature itself.

With an understanding of spellcasting, creatures can cause fire to erupt from their hands, call otherworldly beings to aid them, bewitch the senses, and even bring the dead back to life. The ability to reshape reality to better suit one’s needs and desires is a powerful call that most only dream of being able to answer, and few are ever able to truly master such might.\n\n One such master was Nethys, who was revered as a god-king in ancient Osirion. Having sought to unlock all of the secrets and potential held within the planes and beyond, Nethys shattered his own mind from the sheer overload of knowledge to which he was exposed. Witnessing all of creation, the secrets of the universe, and the vast expanse of what has been seen and will be seen rent his mind in the same moment he elevated to the status of a god. Nethys gained unlimited power and the skill to utilize it, but at the cost of his core self and mental security. This resulted in a split soul, two sides warring within the same body. One seeks to destroy the world, to purge it through fire and ruin, and to conquer all that exists.

He has little use for one, for his sole commandment is to destroy, and his followers need no instruction in how to accomplish that. The figurative and literal monsters who worship Rovagug share their myths and legends in secret shrines and hidden caves, calling him the Rough Beast, the Imprisoned King, the Tide of Fangs, the Unmaker, and the Worldbreaker. They tell each other that each life they snuff out, each piece of art they destroy, each work of labor they bring tumbling down puts a crack in the prison that holds their god. Each of their little efforts of destruction adds up and will one day free him, setting him loose to bring about the end of all things.

He is as likely to curse those who draw his attention as he is to reward them, though great enough acts of violence and destruction may earn his favor. Source Gods &amp; Magic pg. 41 2.0 Minor Boon Your attack becomes more destructive. Once, one of your failed or successful attacks becomes a critical hit, and your weapon or unarmed attack gains the deadly d12 trait for this attack, replacing any deadly trait it already had. Rovagug typically grants this boon when the critical hit could destroy something precious or significant. Moderate Boon You can devour all. You mouth grows into a horrible circular, insectile maw of needle-like teeth. You gain a bite unarmed attack that deals 1d8 piercing damage. Additionally, you can stomach eating anything you can fit down your throat—even rocks or small objects. You gain a +4 status bonus to saves resulting from eating something, such as diseases, poisons, or other effects of the ingested object. This doesn’t allow you to digest magic items that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to destroy, such as cursed items or artifacts. Major Boon You can crack the surface of Golarion, accelerating the release of the Rough Beast. You gain the Quaking Stomp barbarian feat. Minor Curse Whenever you are imprisoned, you thrash and shake as your mind fills with desperation. Any time you are restrained or otherwise imprisoned (such as being sent to jail), you are also clumsy 2 and stupefied 2. Moderate Curse Your destructive rage seeks to remain unbound. Any armor you wear automatically becomes broken. Other items in your possession occasionally become broken over time. Major Curse You are useful only as a beacon of destruction. You are permanently confused, rampaging against anything and everything in your sight, and you deal an additional 18 damage with your unarmed and weapon Strikes.

Once known as Dou-Bral, he crafted the immense Star Towers that still help keep [Rovagug](/Deities.aspx?ID=15) pinned in his prison at Golarion’s heart, lending his own skill and ability to the great deific alliance to bind that evil entity. Yet a divine argument between him and his sister [Shelyn](/Deities.aspx?ID=17) resulted in the god departing for parts unknown.

Source Gods &amp; Magic - Web Supplement pg. 3 Minor Boon Once, when you fail a saving throw against an effect that would compel you to take some action against your will, you critically succeed instead. Arazni typically grants this boon for consequential actions or particularly egregious violations of free will. Moderate Boon Blood from your wounds forms into armor or a piece of equipment you need. If what you need most is information, the blood forms letters spelling out that information. Major Boon Upon death, you return to life with the effects of a critical success on a resurrect ritual to enact vengeance against your killers. When you successfully achieve vengeance, abandon your vengeance for other pursuits, or fail outright, you crumble to scarlet dust. Minor Curse Someone you’ve wronged gains information they desire about you, with the effects of a critical success at the commune ritual. Moderate Curse Creatures weaker than you gain a status bonus on all attack rolls against you equal to your difference in levels, to a maximum of +4. Whenever you are damaged by a such a creature, you take persistent bleed damage equal to twice the difference between your levels (no maximum). Major Curse When you would regain Hit Points due to either a positive or negative effect, you lose that many Hit Points instead.

Formerly an artificial intelligence cloned from the mind of an android from outer space, Casandalee gained her godhood in the heart of Numeria within the computer core of a crashed spaceship, becoming the patron of artificial life, free thinking, and intellectual apotheosis.\n\nThough she is sometimes referred to as the Iron Goddess, Casandalee is much more than simple metal.

Source Gods &amp; Magic - Web Supplement pg. 5 Minor Boon Your commitment to filth draws a small cloud of disease-laden insects. Once, you can summon a cloud of midges, mosquitos, and flies to surround you for 1 minute. Creatures adjacent to you at any point during that time become drained 1, sickened 1, and exposed to a blood-borne illness. Ghlaunder typically grants this boon when you can infect a significant number of creatures. Moderate Boon Ghlaunder teaches you to bide your time, corrupting and infecting until the time is right. When you expose a creature to a disease and it succeeds at its Fortitude save, it is still infected unless it critically succeeds. However, such a creature experiences no effects and the disease does not progress for the first 24 hours, even if the disease is normally fast-acting or someone uses another ability to progress the disease. It’s very difficult to detect the infection in the first day; the DC for Medicine checks to do so is 5 higher. Major Boon Ghlaunder rewards his followers with the ability to safely spread illness—or on occasion, offers respite to desperate petitioners who please him. You do not take negative effects from any disease you are infected with unless or until Ghlaunder rescinds this benefit. Minor Curse Ghlaunder drains away your life force for himself. You become drained 1 and can’t reduce your drained condition below 1. Moderate Curse Ghlaunder leeches your energy from you as easily as blood. Any time you fail a Fortitude save, you become fatigued in addition to all other effects. Major Curse You are struck with a contagious disease of the GM’s choice. You and anyone else you infect can’t be cured of the disease or improve its condition to an earlier stage in any way until you infect two other sapient beings with the disease.

This doesn’t protect you from anything dangerous in your food, but it also doesn’t prevent you from tasting those dangerous elements of the food. Moderate Boon You always seem to find safe shelter when you most need it. Once per day, you can cast rope trick as a divine innate spell. Major Boon Kazutal smiles upon those who seek to offer aid, no matter how meek or helpless they may be. Any time creatures attempt a check to Aid you, they can choose to automatically succeed. If a creature chooses to roll for the attempt and rolls a success, it gets a critical success instead, granting a +4 circumstance bonus even if it doesn’t have legendary proficiency in that skill. You gain the same benefits when you attempt to Aid others. Minor Curse Community opinion turns against you. Humanoids in your community who would normally start as indifferent toward you start as unfriendly instead. Moderate Curse Your strength betrays you, preventing you from taking more than your fair share. You are enfeebled 2 and can’t carry anything beyond the gear you are actively wearing or using. Major Curse You are cursed to depend upon others for your survival. You can’t eat anything, drink anything, or use any gear or magic items unless they were willingly given to you by someone who rightfully owns them. Work-arounds like having an ally strip the gear from someone’s corpse and then give it to you willingly automatically fail.

Eventually, Nivi’s debts grew too great for her to remain in her surface home, and she fled into the depths of the Darklands to evade the wrath of her creditors. Most of her adventures in the lightless lands are lost to time and history, but she ultimately emerged reborn as a goddess, hailed as the first of the svirfneblin—uncanny underground gnomes with unique magical abilities and immunity to the dread Bleaching, a wasting curse that claims the lives of gnomes who succumb to boredom and ennui.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Category** [Other Gods](/DeityCategories.aspx?ID=2)\r\n\r\n**Edicts** take risks and savor the consequences whether good or ill, use stealth and guile over violence when dealing with the fallout from your risk-taking, learn the rules and strategies of games of chance played wherever you travel\r\n\r\n**Anathema** break the established rules or terms of a wager, use violence to avoid the consequences of a wager\r\n\r\n**Area of Concern**\r\ngambling, gems, gnomes, stealth\r\n\r\n**Follower Alignments**\r\nLN, NG, N, CN\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Deities/NiviRhombodazzle.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n<title level=\"2\">Devotee Benefits</title>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**[Divine Ability](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=132)**\r\nDexterity or Intelligence\r\n\r\n**Divine Font** [Harm](/Spells.aspx?ID=146) or [Heal](/Spells.aspx?ID=148)\r\n\r\n**Divine Skill** [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15)\r\n\r\n**Favored Weapon** [Light Hammer](/Weapons.aspx?ID=29)\r\n\r\n**Domains** [Family](/Domains.aspx?ID=11), [Luck](/Domains.aspx?ID=18), [Trickery](/Domains.aspx?ID=31), [Wealth](/Domains.aspx?ID=36)\r\n\r\n**[Alternate Domains](/Rules.aspx?ID=802)** [Confidence](/Domains.aspx?ID=4), [Earth](/Domains.aspx?ID=10)\r\n\r\n**Cleric Spells**\n\n- **1st**\r\n[Illusory Disguise](/Spells.aspx?ID=159)\n\n- **2nd**\r\n[Invisibility](/Spells.aspx?ID=164)\n\n- **4th**\r\n[Private Sanctum](/Spells.aspx?ID=235)\n\n</column><title level=\"2\">Divine Intercession</title>\r\n\r\nThe Grey Polychrome is a carefree and self-indulgent deity who detests using violence where wits will serve.

Once, instead of attempting the check you would normally roll, you attempt a DC 11 flat check with the same results. Nivi always grants this boon when the odds are stacked against you (though this same effect is an alternate to her minor curse if she uses it for a check when you would have been very likely to succeed).\r\n\r\n**Moderate Boon** Nivi bestows a fraction of her skill at pushing consequences down the road. Once per day, after attempting a check, you can roll a second time. You must use the result of the second roll, even if it is worse. This is a fortune effect. At any point after you use this boon, the GM can replace one of your check results with the first result of the check you attempted when using this boon; this delayed result can’t be further delayed, prevented, or affected in any way, even by other divine intercessions.\r\n\r\n**Major Boon** Those who have done much to please Nivi find themselves slipping from sight when needed. Any time you attempt a [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) check to [Hide](/Actions.aspx?ID=62) or [Sneak](/Actions.aspx?ID=63), you also gain the effects of 2nd-level [_invisibility_](/Spells.aspx?ID=164) and [_fleet step_](/Spells.aspx?ID=122) spells to help you elude your enemies. These effects last until the end of your next turn or until you stop Hiding or Sneaking, whichever comes first (you can continue to Hide or Sneak, turn after turn, to extend these effects).\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**Minor Curse** Those who betray Nivi’s trust find defeat where there was sure to be victory. Once, when you roll a natural 20 on a die, the result becomes a natural 1 instead. Nivi typically uses this curse for maximum poetic justice.\r\n\r\n**Moderate Curse** Those who arouse Nivi’s wrath find themselves bound to the earth with no place to hide.

She was once a mortal gnome who loved the thrill of an exciting wager, up to and including the moment when the dice turned against her. Eventually, Nivi’s debts grew too great for her to remain in her surface home, and she fled into the depths of the Darklands to evade the wrath of her creditors. Most of her adventures in the lightless lands are lost to time and history, but she ultimately emerged reborn as a goddess, hailed as the first of the svirfneblin—uncanny underground gnomes with unique magical abilities and immunity to the dread Bleaching, a wasting curse that claims the lives of gnomes who succumb to boredom and ennui.

She rewards cunning in her followers and punishes crudeness. Source Gods &amp; Magic - Web Supplement pg. 8 Minor Boon Those who have earned Nivi’s trust are blessed with wild turns of luck in the worst of circumstances. Once, instead of attempting the check you would normally roll, you attempt a DC 11 flat check with the same results. Nivi always grants this boon when the odds are stacked against you (though this same effect is an alternate to her minor curse if she uses it for a check when you would have been very likely to succeed). Moderate Boon Nivi bestows a fraction of her skill at pushing consequences down the road. Once per day, after attempting a check, you can roll a second time. You must use the result of the second roll, even if it is worse. This is a fortune effect. At any point after you use this boon, the GM can replace one of your check results with the first result of the check you attempted when using this boon; this delayed result can’t be further delayed, prevented, or affected in any way, even by other divine intercessions. Major Boon Those who have done much to please Nivi find themselves slipping from sight when needed. Any time you attempt a Stealth check to Hide or Sneak, you also gain the effects of 2nd-level invisibility and fleet step spells to help you elude your enemies. These effects last until the end of your next turn or until you stop Hiding or Sneaking, whichever comes first (you can continue to Hide or Sneak, turn after turn, to extend these effects). Minor Curse Those who betray Nivi’s trust find defeat where there was sure to be victory. Once, when you roll a natural 20 on a die, the result becomes a natural 1 instead. Nivi typically uses this curse for maximum poetic justice. Moderate Curse Those who arouse Nivi’s wrath find themselves bound to the earth with no place to hide. You are wreathed in constant faerie fire and constantly affected by earthbind , and any effect that grants invisibility doesn’t work on you. Major Curse Nivi curses unworthy adherents with recklessness. Any time you are presented with a wager, you are compelled to accept, no matter the odds. If you succeed at a DC 40 Will save, you can at least attempt to alter the stakes of that wager in your favor, but you must still accept.

Lush plants that entice prey only to kill with barbs or toxins lie within her authority, as do lustful acts and whispered secrets occurring in wild terrain. Her seductive form shifts from that of a beautiful fey such as nymphs to incorporating natural lures like sweet-smelling flowers and graceful verdant tresses.

Andoletta makes a clear distinction between guilt and innocence: there is no in-between. For those falsely accused or who show signs of redemption, she offers a path back to the light. That path is never an easy one, but it is one worth walking, and she stands beside those who make the trek. For the truly wicked and those who show no remorse, she has no mercy. For these reasons, her likeness is often found in courts, where she can watch over and ensure fairness to those accused of crimes.

Children are slates with tremendous potential for good—if they can be guided and kept safe from evil.\n\n When she appears to mortals, Grandmother Crow does so as an older woman, gray-haired, wrinkled, and with keen, knowing eyes.

Dancing is Ashava’s true love, and she encourages her followers to dance often. For some, she is little more than a patron of that art, but Ashava is also a guide, both in spirit and in the physical world. For the living, she leads the lonely out of their difficult times, her lights guiding lost wanderers back to safety. For the dead, her haunting moonlit dances lead lost and lonely spirits onward to their eternal judgment. She encourages her followers to steer those who are lost—whether in the wilderness or in their hearts—to where they need to go. Priests of Ashava are the dancing light that guides the way, but will-o’-wisps are anathema to Ashava, and her followers destroy these creatures wherever they are found.\n\n The True Spark appears as a tall woman, flushed with the exertion of prolonged dancing.

Dancing is Ashava’s true love, and she encourages her followers to dance often. For some, she is little more than a patron of that art, but Ashava is also a guide, both in spirit and in the physical world. For the living, she leads the lonely out of their difficult times, her lights guiding lost wanderers back to safety. For the dead, her haunting moonlit dances lead lost and lonely spirits onward to their eternal judgment. She encourages her followers to steer those who are lost—whether in the wilderness or in their hearts—to where they need to go. Priests of Ashava are the dancing light that guides the way, but will-o’-wisps are anathema to Ashava, and her followers destroy these creatures wherever they are found. The True Spark appears as a tall woman, flushed with the exertion of prolonged dancing. Her features are difficult to see unless under moonlight, when they instead become crystal clear. She wears a beautiful gown woven from starlight that always sways in motion, and she never appears to be standing still. On her brow she wears a wreath of many-colored moss.

Facts and information are important to Eritrice, but truths and wisdom gained through discussion are far more valuable to her than those gained through books. She maintains there is nothing wrong with disagreeing so long as the disagreement is respectful, and that it is crucial to be open to discussion, willing to consider new information, and receptive to forming new opinions. Opinions are valuable in that they help understand other views, but Eritrice reminds her followers that opinions are not facts and can be incorrect and even harmful.

Facts and information are important to Eritrice, but truths and wisdom gained through discussion are far more valuable to her than those gained through books. She maintains there is nothing wrong with disagreeing so long as the disagreement is respectful, and that it is crucial to be open to discussion, willing to consider new information, and receptive to forming new opinions. Opinions are valuable in that they help understand other views, but Eritrice reminds her followers that opinions are not facts and can be incorrect and even harmful.

In particular, he believes that although the tireless fight against wickedness is admirable, the ultimate triumph over evil will come in the form of redemption rather than destruction. Korada’s dedication to peace is such that he and his followers refuse to cause harm to their attackers, instead using their martial skills only to defend themselves. Many Koradans seek greater wisdom through study or meditation in hopes of better understanding their foes so as to guide them toward redemption. This dedication to self-awareness, philosophy, and introspection is said to have allowed Korada greater insight into the workings of the universe, granting him the great gift of foresight. Korada rarely acts on his visions, however, believing the struggle that comes with true change is always worthwhile, whether or not such a change is successful.\n\n The Open Hand of Harmony takes the form of a lithe, athletic man donning simple robes. He is covered in sparse, light-brown fur and has three monkey tails that constantly writhe behind him, much like the dancing flames of a powerful fire. Most of Korada’s followers are those who have lived imbalanced lives or faced persistent violence as they seek to find peace in their life and within themselves.

The sea may sometimes encroach on the land, but breakwaters can be built to keep communities on land dry and safe.

She sometimes instead appears as a human woman with the head of an osprey. In this form she wears robes that sway like the waves of the sea, their blue folds foaming white at the edges, and she carries a teak longbow strung with gold.

She believes that mysteries lead to truth, but how one arrives at that truth is as important as the answer itself. All questions are puzzles, and all puzzles are worth solving.

Sent to Abaddon, she rose quickly through the ranks of daemonkind, and when she saw weakness in the Horseman of War, she slew him in battle, claiming his title for herself. Szuriel appears as a tragic angel with beautiful golden hair, magnificent wings, and polished obsidian eyes that continuously weep blood. She resides in the Cinder Furnace, her corner of Abaddon where instruments of war are forged from the fires of burning souls. Szuriel commands one of the largest standing armies in all of existence, countless daemonic soldiers ready to wage war. All fear oblivion at the hands of Szuriel and her army. The Horseman of War is always happy to lend her powers, warriors, and devastating discoveries across the planes. So long as war continues, more souls are pulled into her ever-burning furnace.

Though many people view decay and entropy as manifestations of chaos, followers of Kerkamoth understand that in an orderly universe, the end of one cycle makes way for the beginning of a new cycle.

Here, all souls pass through and are judged—sorted by [Pharasma](/Deities.aspx?ID=14) and her psychopomp servitors into their respective afterlives on the Outer Planes, as reflected by their deeds in life. It's a somber plane of graveyards and memorials separated into eight courts, one for each other plane of the Outer Sphere.\n\n But the life of a soul isn't always easy to judge. The fate of some souls is debated in Pharasma's courts, either by the souls themselves, servitors of other planes, or the psychopomps and psychopomp ushers who, despite serving Pharasma in the vast bureaucracy of death, have their own opinions over the complexities of the soul and the intricacies of judgement. Here, Narakaas and their followers step in.\n\n While change and transformations can be sudden and all encompassing—the transition from alive to dead, for example—other changes are completed not in moments but over years, decades, or lifetimes. When a soul is amid true, personal change but dies before their transformation is complete, they fall under Narakaas's purview. Narakaas offers such souls a choice: complete their metamorphosis, for good or for ill, and be judged upon these efforts, or be judged now, as the souls are, by the deeds of their life. Many souls choose the easy path, for transformation and change are never easy, and for mortals, true change is nearly always accompanied by pain. Thus, by choosing transformation, the soul is choosing to willingly endure arduous trials, difficult decisions, and suffering—whether emotional, physical, or psychological—within the safety of Narakaas's realm to prove their dedication and facilitate change. Upon their transformation, when their souls match the truth of their heart, these souls are released to Pharasma to be judged, not only by their deeds in life but by the person they became. Narakaas imposes no assessment upon the results of these transformations, functioning as a facilitator and providing opportunity to souls to finish their personal apotheosis and end their life's journey on their own terms.\n\n Narakaas is also called upon to judge those souls who straddle the lines of good and evil or law and chaos but who find no middle ground in between. Souls who believe in one thing but were driven to take drastic actions against their beliefs due to external circumstances or to achieve their goals—the defenders driven to commit atrocities to defend their neighbors, the paladins willing to sacrifice for the greater good, the revolutionaries who spark war to topple tyrants, the villains who perform heroic deeds for purely self-serving reasons, and the murderers who obscure their crimes beneath a veil of charity and good deeds—all these and more fall to Narakaas to judge.\n\n But what of those souls who arrive in the Boneyard incomplete? What of the souls degraded by time, wounded by predators, or nearly destroyed by the trials they've endured? Is it fair to judge such souls? What if the missing pieces would tell a different story? To Narakaas, something damaged or broken— especially one repaired—is no less valuable than one unblemished. Sometimes, it's more precious for the history it now embodies. Damaged souls are no different. Thus, when an incomplete or damaged soul enters the Boneyard, it proceeds not to judgment, but to a soul repository operated by devotees of Narakaas.

Here, all …","text":" Narakaas (The Cleansing Sentence) Source Pathfinder #186: Ghost King's Rage pg. 73, Gods &amp; Magic pg. 130 2.0 The River of Souls terminates at the Boneyard, an impossibly tall and ever-growing spire of quintessence that pierces the Astral Plane. Here, all souls pass through and are judged—sorted by Pharasma and her psychopomp servitors into their respective afterlives on the Outer Planes, as reflected by their deeds in life. It's a somber plane of graveyards and memorials separated into eight courts, one for each other plane of the Outer Sphere. But the life of a soul isn't always easy to judge. The fate of some souls is debated in Pharasma's courts, either by the souls themselves, servitors of other planes, or the psychopomps and psychopomp ushers who, despite serving Pharasma in the vast bureaucracy of death, have their own opinions over the complexities of the soul and the intricacies of judgement. Here, Narakaas and their followers step in. While change and transformations can be sudden and all encompassing—the transition from alive to dead, for example—other changes are completed not in moments but over years, decades, or lifetimes. When a soul is amid true, personal change but dies before their transformation is complete, they fall under Narakaas's purview. Narakaas offers such souls a choice: complete their metamorphosis, for good or for ill, and be judged upon these efforts, or be judged now, as the souls are, by the deeds of their life. Many souls choose the easy path, for transformation and change are never easy, and for mortals, true change is nearly always accompanied by pain. Thus, by choosing transformation, the soul is choosing to willingly endure arduous trials, difficult decisions, and suffering—whether emotional, physical, or psychological—within the safety of Narakaas's realm to prove their dedication and facilitate change. Upon their transformation, when their souls match the truth of their heart, these souls are released to Pharasma to be judged, not only by their deeds in life but by the person they became. Narakaas imposes no assessment upon the results of these transformations, functioning as a facilitator and providing opportunity to souls to finish their personal apotheosis and end their life's journey on their own terms. Narakaas is also called upon to judge those souls who straddle the lines of good and evil or law and chaos but who find no middle ground in between. Souls who believe in one thing but were driven to take drastic actions against their beliefs due to external circumstances or to achieve their goals—the defenders driven to commit atrocities to defend their neighbors, the paladins willing to sacrifice for the greater good, the revolutionaries who spark war to topple tyrants, the villains who perform heroic deeds for purely self-serving reasons, and the murderers who obscure their crimes beneath a veil of charity and good deeds—all these and more fall to Narakaas to judge. But what of those souls who arrive in the Boneyard incomplete? What of the souls degraded by time, wounded by predators, or nearly destroyed by the trials they've endured? Is it fair to judge such souls? What if the missing pieces would tell a different story? To Narakaas, something damaged or broken— especially one repaired—is no less valuable than one unblemished. Sometimes, it's more precious for the history it now embodies. Damaged souls are no different. Thus, when an incomplete or damaged soul enters the Boneyard, it proceeds not to judgment, but to a soul repository operated by devotees of Narakaas. Within these facilities, damaged souls are mended and healed, then released when they become complete enough to be fairly judged. Sometimes, this process takes millennia, as pieces of the souls consumed by other creatures or lost along the River of Souls slowly make their way to the Boneyard. Despite their sobering responsibilities, Narakaas is an optimist who believes in the power of redemption.

He works toward this feat through his avatar, the King in Yellow, which can manifest anywhere in the universe the light from Carcosa’s sun can be seen. The King in Yellow appears as a humanoid figure draped in yellow clothing, but there is nothing within the clothes save a shapeless, horrifying presence.

He works toward this feat through his avatar, the King in Yellow, which can manifest anywhere in the universe the light from Carcosa’s sun can be seen.

Category Faiths &amp; Philosophies Edicts The gods of Sarkoris have very few shared edicts, but several are often prominently shared amongst them: protect your clan and your people, educate the clan’s children’s in the traditions and histories of the clan’s god, and carefully record the name and image of each new god when they first appear so that they are not forgotten and can continue to watch over the people. Anathema There is only one anathema universally enforced by the gods of Sarkoris: make no deals or bargains with demons, as the advent of the Worldwound led to the destruction of many clans and the loss of many gods, some of whom may never be seen again. Area of Concern Each god has their own particular inclinations and interests, typically informed by the predominant attitudes and beliefs of their clan.\n","trait":["Any"],"trait_raw":["Any"],"type":"Deity","url":"/Deities.aspx?ID=200","weakness":{}}},{"_index":"aon18","_id":"deity-201","_score":4.3909864,"_source":{"ability":["Constitution","Intelligence"],"alignment":"LN","breadcrumbs_spa":[],"category":"deity","deity":["Laws of Mortality"],"deity_markdown":"[Laws of Mortality](/Deities.aspx?ID=201)","deity_category":"Faiths & Philosophies","deity_category_markdown":"[Faiths & Philosophies](/DeityCategories.aspx?ID=0)","deity_category_order":"3Faiths & Philosophies","divine_font_markdown":"","domain_markdown":"","domain_alternate_markdown":"","domain_primary_markdown":"","exclude_from_search":false,"favored_weapon_markdown":"","follower_alignment":["LG","LN","LE","NG","N","NE"],"id":"deity-201","markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Deity \" pfs=\"Standard\">[Laws of Mortality](/Deities.aspx?ID=201)</title>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n<column gap=\"medium\" flex=\"1 1 400px\">\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"LN\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Gods &amp; Magic](/Sources.aspx?ID=17) pg. 97 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\nThe Laws of Mortality originated in the Garundi nation of Rahadoum as a response to the Oath Wars, a series of internecine conflicts that were tearing the nation’s society apart.

Looking down from above, these deities help travelers and voyagers find their path. Their guidance can be literal, or for others, more spiritual—some worshippers seek to know the progress of [Sarenrae](/Deities.aspx?ID=16) (the sun), [Tsukiyo](/Deities.aspx?ID=48) (the moon), and [Desna](/Deities.aspx?ID=5) (the stars) and through this knowledge gain enlightenment.

[Lubaiko](/Deities.aspx?ID=226) provided the first flames of rebellion, literally igniting the first cart that led to the initial confrontation at a plantation on the outskirts of Eleder. The tales then note that the casks on the cart erupted as the first blow was struck, creating a massive explosion that woke everyone on the plantation. Many say this was [Cayden Cailean's](/Deities.aspx?ID=4) way of showing his support. As everyone stirred about and watched those first servants and slaves fight, others were fearful of the consequences. It was the touch of hope that [Milani](/Deities.aspx?ID=43) granted them that finally gave them the strength to rise up and fight for freedom.\n\n  Whether or not the stories hold truth, the Freeing Flame remains a notable pantheon among the people of Vidrian today.

Lubaiko provided the first flames of rebellion, literally igniting the first cart that led to the initial confrontation at a plantation on the outskirts of Eleder. The tales then note that the casks on the cart erupted as the first blow was struck, creating a massive explosion that woke everyone on the plantation. Many say this was Cayden Cailean's way of showing his support. As everyone stirred about and watched those first servants and slaves fight, others were fearful of the consequences. It was the touch of hope that Milani granted them that finally gave them the strength to rise up and fight for freedom. Whether or not the stories hold truth, the Freeing Flame remains a notable pantheon among the people of Vidrian today. The young nation broke free from the shackles of oppression and now looks toward bettering itself in the future, a mantra that many Vidrics and followers of the Freeing Flame follow for themselves.

Rowdrosh lived among the packs and herds, eventually settling among a herd of sheep and partially adopting their form. He was the first to domesticate an animal, and with patience and his blessing, countless people have followed in his footsteps since, taming dogs, oxen, sheep, mammoths, and far wilder creatures throughout the ages. Rowdrosh teaches people to watch over those in their charge—whether a literal herd or members of a following—and to treat animals with the kindness, care, and patience they would afford their own kin. Rowdrosh's influence in shaping the modern following is undeniable, even among those groups that don't pay homage to him. \n\nRowdrosh is a shapeshifter capable of transforming into countless animal forms, but artistic depictions of the Herdsman are surprisingly consistent. He's shown as a strong Kellid man with brown skin and thick black hair covering his head, chest, and shoulders. His head sports two curving horns made of moonstone, and he wields a wooden crook. Rowdrosh supposedly travels the lands in the guise of a herd animal from time to time, to test the care that each following offers to their animal members.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Category** [Mammoth Lord Gods](/DeityCategories.aspx?ID=22)\r\n\r\n**Edicts** aid your community, protect those you have authority over, treat animals with respect\r\n\r\n**Anathema** abandon your community, neglect those in your care, torment animals\r\n\r\n**Area of Concern**\r\nanimal husbandry, herd animals, shepherds\r\n\r\n**Follower Alignments**\r\nLG, NG, CG\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n<title level=\"2\">Devotee Benefits</title>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**[Divine Ability](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=132)**\r\nConstitution or Wisdom\r\n\r\n**Divine Font** [Heal](/Spells.aspx?ID=148)\r\n\r\n**Divine Skill** [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)\r\n\r\n**Favored Weapon** [Staff](/Weapons.aspx?ID=12)\r\n\r\n**Domains** [Family](/Domains.aspx?ID=11), [Nature](/Domains.aspx?ID=22), [Protection](/Domains.aspx?ID=27), [Travel](/Domains.aspx?ID=30)\r\n\r\n**[Alternate Domains](/Rules.aspx?ID=802)** \r\n\r\n**Cleric Spells**\n\n- **1st**\r\n[Magic Fang](/Spells.aspx?ID=179)\n\n- **2nd**\r\n[Speak with Animals](/Spells.aspx?ID=293)\n\n- **2nd**\r\n[Animal Form](/Spells.aspx?ID=10)\n\n</column>","name":"Rowdrosh (The Herdsman)","pfs":"Limited","rarity":"common","release_date":"2022-02-23","resistance":{},"search_markdown":"<additional-info>\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #176: Lost Mammoth Valley](/Sources.aspx?ID=113) pg. 65</row>\r\n\r\n**Divine Font** Heal\r\n\r\n**Divine Skill** [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)\r\n\r\n**Favored Weapon** [Staff](/Weapons.aspx?ID=12)\r\n\r\n**Domains** [Family](/Domains.aspx?ID=11), [Nature](/Domains.aspx?ID=22), [Protection](/Domains.aspx?ID=27), [Travel](/Domains.aspx?ID=30)\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nWithin the Realm of the Mammoth Lords, animals often hold as much importance as people, for both have spirits and are a part of the natural world. …\r\n</summary>","skill":["Nature"],"skill_markdown":"[Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)","source":["Pathfinder #176: Lost Mammoth Valley"],"source_raw":["Pathfinder #176: Lost Mammoth Valley pg. 65"],"source_category":"Adventure Paths","source_group":"Quest for the Frozen Flame","source_markdown":"<row gap=\"tiny\">[Pathfinder #176: Lost Mammoth Valley](/Sources.aspx?ID=113) pg. 65</row>","speed":{},"summary":"Within the Realm of the Mammoth Lords, animals often hold as much importance as people, for both have spirits and are a part of the natural world. …","summary_markdown":"Within the Realm of the Mammoth Lords, animals often hold as much importance as people, for both have spirits and are a part of the natural world. …","text":" Rowdrosh (The Herdsman) Source Pathfinder #176: Lost Mammoth Valley pg. 65 Within the Realm of the Mammoth Lords, animals often hold as much importance as people, for both have spirits and are a part of the natural world.

Rowdrosh teaches people to watch over those in their charge—whether a literal herd or members of a following—and to treat animals with the kindness, care, and patience they would afford their own kin. Rowdrosh's influence in shaping the modern following is undeniable, even among those groups that don't pay homage to him. Rowdrosh is a shapeshifter capable of transforming into countless animal forms, but artistic depictions of the Herdsman are surprisingly consistent. He's shown as a strong Kellid man with brown skin and thick black hair covering his head, chest, and shoulders. His head sports two curving horns made of moonstone, and he wields a wooden crook. Rowdrosh supposedly travels the lands in the guise of a herd animal from time to time, to test the care that each following offers to their animal members.

They look to [Andoletta](/Deities.aspx?ID=112), Grandmother Crow, for aid in teaching and instilling knowledge and virtue as well as to [Likha](/Deities.aspx?ID=192) to support their efforts to teach (especially with a wide historical perspective), perform plays, and organize recitals and lectures in the name of learning.\n\n They appeal to [Soralyon](/Deities.aspx?ID=128) for protection, particularly of historical buildings, monuments, artifacts, and their study of such things. For especially thorny problems and for help in devising new solutions from their research, they turn to the [Zohls](/Deities.aspx?ID=133), the embodiment of Verity.

Its adherents unite the optimism and art of Shelyn with the vast knowledge of Thoth to inspire their investigations and writings of artistic, scientific, historical, and magical knowledge. They look to Andoletta, Grandmother Crow, for aid in teaching and instilling knowledge and virtue as well as to Likha to support their efforts to teach (especially with a wide historical perspective), perform plays, and organize recitals and lectures in the name of learning. They appeal to Soralyon for protection, particularly of historical buildings, monuments, artifacts, and their study of such things. For especially thorny problems and for help in devising new solutions from their research, they turn to the Zohls, the embodiment of Verity.

Such laborers seek strength in all its many forms. They look to [Kurgess](/Deities.aspx?ID=42), the Strong Man, who was once a laborer himself, for aid in using their full potential, seeking to better themselves and encouraging others to strive toward their own potential, no matter their work. From [Torag](/Deities.aspx?ID=18), they take the strength to be honorable and forthright and keep their word.

Recently, a small but growing number of followers, especially near Mzali, have been including [Tlehar](/Deities.aspx?ID=217), too, as they seek the mental fortitude to give their best even as they hope each day will be better than the last. You'll find that these laborers won't cheat at honorable contests, swindle you, intentionally make anything subpar, or be mean or standoffish when drunk. Their religious observances tend to be frequent and regular but not at all fussy or lengthy. Ceremonies always seem to include food, drink, and games afterwards—or perhaps as part of the observances themselves. Followers of the Laborer's Bastion clearly place more value in companionship and reassurance of their faith than in following a formal script and getting all the rituals right.

Cozy cabin is a 3rd-level spell as originally printed in the Advanced Player’s Guide._\r\n\r\nThe Offering Plate is a pantheon centered on selfless acts, charitable giving, and passing along skills or knowledge to improve the circumstances of those less fortunate. Followers believe [Abadar](/Deities.aspx?ID=1) agrees the health of a city's economy depends in part upon helping those least fortunate return to the market. Clerics sometimes carry flails that double as collection pots for donations. They find legal loopholes and contractually sound means of channeling funding and supplies to worthy causes in their community. [Alseta](/Deities.aspx?ID=30) reigns over transitions, and worshippers of the Offering Plate ask for her help as they assist those in need to transition from poverty and hardship into the next phase of their lives. Followers call upon [Folgrit](/Deities.aspx?ID=87) for patience and follow her edicts to take in or find homes for those without families. [Kazutal](/Deities.aspx?ID=41) teaches followers of the Offering Plate the ultimate goal of charity is to build a strong and loving community. [Cayden Cailean](/Deities.aspx?ID=4) reminds them every person deserves to live a life free of oppressive restrains, as well as a little leisure occasionally to lighten their loads. Many followers of the Offering Plate form traveling groups that share their time and wealth with those in need. These caravans are known as Offering Trains and some trains remain on a permanent route that travels between multiple settlements in the Inner Sea. These trains visit prosperous settlements, collecting what supplies and offerings they can, before moving on to deliver these donations to the less fortunate in other locations.

Cozy cabin is a 3rd-level spell as originally printed in the Advanced Player’s Guide. The Offering Plate is a pantheon centered on selfless acts, charitable giving, and passing along skills or knowledge to improve the circumstances of those less fortunate. Followers believe Abadar agrees the health of a city's economy depends in part upon helping those least fortunate return to the market. Clerics sometimes carry flails that double as collection pots for donations. They find legal loopholes and contractually sound means of channeling funding and supplies to worthy causes in their community. Alseta reigns over transitions, and worshippers of the Offering Plate ask for her help as they assist those in need to transition from poverty and hardship into the next phase of their lives. Followers call upon Folgrit for patience and follow her edicts to take in or find homes for those without families. Kazutal teaches followers of the Offering Plate the ultimate goal of charity is to build a strong and loving community. Cayden Cailean reminds them every person deserves to live a life free of oppressive restrains, as well as a little leisure occasionally to lighten their loads. Many followers of the Offering Plate form traveling groups that share their time and wealth with those in need. These caravans are known as Offering Trains and some trains remain on a permanent route that travels between multiple settlements in the Inner Sea. These trains visit prosperous settlements, collecting what supplies and offerings they can, before moving on to deliver these donations to the less fortunate in other locations. One Offering Train has been making its way from Almas, up along the Sellen River, and delivering goods to the people of Mendev and the Sarkoris Scar for a number of years, earning them the title of the Crusader Caravan.

You won't find a city of any size in the region that doesn't boast a sizable temple to honor his tenets of expanding civilization, promoting prosperity, and following the rule of law. This pantheon expands his focus by enjoining the kinder and more uplifting elements of urban life, shifting away from Abadar's well-known pursuit of wealth to a pursuit of peace and prosperity for everyone in the city. Worshippers of this pantheon invoke [Alseta](/Deities.aspx?ID=30) the Welcomer, who watches over city gates to keep invaders out and defenders safe, as well as [Tanagaar](/Deities.aspx?ID=129) the Aurulent Eye, who keeps a careful eye over those who protect the innocent at night.

From [Korada](/Deities.aspx?ID=123), they draw their inspiration in the pursuit of a peaceful mindset and public policy that enjoins harmony, using the law to support redemption. In another departure from what you'll see as a common Abadaran practice, the worshippers of this pantheon don't build opulent, flashy temples.

Deeply self-reliant, these faithful rarely trouble the goddesses with lengthy prayers, merely asking for the strength to honor their convictions and the resolve to hold out despite all odds.<br /> While Firebrands are often dismissed as whimsical and flighty braggadocios, members of the organization have been involved in the Inner Sea's most serious political upheavals. The struggles that gave birth to the Firebrands—namely, Vidrian and Ravounel's fights for independence—began with small, brave bands fighting against the impossible might of infernal Cheliax.<br /> Firebrands still join with the remnants of the Knights of Lastwall to fight the Whispering Tyrant.

If they …","text":" The Last Breath Source Firebrands pg. 70 When all seems lost and no good reason for hope endures, some still resolve to fight their oppressors with every last ounce of strength. If they can't triumph, at least they'll make their foes pay dearly for victory. Whether inspired by Arazni's unyielding spirit, Milani's selflessness, or Calistria's thirst for vengeance, those who worship the Last Breath will never yield to tyrants, bullies, or abusers. Deeply self-reliant, these faithful rarely trouble the goddesses with lengthy prayers, merely asking for the strength to honor their convictions and the resolve to hold out despite all odds. While Firebrands are often dismissed as whimsical and flighty braggadocios, members of the organization have been involved in the Inner Sea's most serious political upheavals. The struggles that gave birth to the Firebrands—namely, Vidrian and Ravounel's fights for independence—began with small, brave bands fighting against the impossible might of infernal Cheliax. Firebrands still join with the remnants of the Knights of Lastwall to fight the Whispering Tyrant. When setting out to spit in the eye of the forces of Hell or to challenge dire powers beyond death, there's little hope of victory—but what could be greater than standing with the oppressed, facing down evil with dignity?
